table of contents year ended december  in thousands other non gaap financial data ebitda ebitdar ebitda and ebitdar are supplemental non gaap financial measures 
regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures  and other provisions of the securities exchange act of  as amended  define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
we calculate ebitda as net income before a interest expense  net  b provision for income taxes  and c depreciation and amortization 
we calculate ebitdar by adjusting ebitda to exclude facility rent cost of services 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 
we believe ebitda and ebitdar are useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because they are widely used by investors and analysts in our industry as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry without regard to items such as interest expense  net and depreciation and amortization  which can vary substantially from company to company depending on the book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  and they help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results 
we use ebitda and ebitdar as measurements of our operating performance to assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business  to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  and to compare our operating performance to that of our competitors 
we typically use ebitda and ebitdar to compare the operating performance of each skilled nursing and assisted living facility 
ebitda and ebitdar are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  and  with respect to ebitdar  facility rent cost of services  which may vary from period to period depending upon various factors  including the method used to finance facilities  the amount of debt that we have incurred  whether a facility is owned or leased  the date of acquisition of a facility or business  or the tax law of the state in which a business unit operates 
as a result  we believe that the use of ebitda and ebitdar provide a meaningful and consistent comparison of our business between periods by eliminating certain items required by gaap 
we also establish compensation programs and bonuses for our facility level employees that are partially based upon the achievement of ebitdar targets 
despite the importance of these measures in analyzing our underlying business  designing incentive compensation and for our goal setting  ebitda and ebitdar are non gaap financial measures that have no standardized meaning defined by gaap 
therefore  our ebitda and ebitdar measures have limitations as 
table of contents analytical tools  and they should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations are they do not reflect our current or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  they do not reflect the net interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  they do not reflect any income tax payments we may be required to make  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and ebitdar do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do  which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures 
we compensate for these limitations by using them only to supplement net income on a basis prepared in accordance with gaap in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 
because these non gaap financial measures are not standardized  it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or similar names

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
see item a 
risk factors 
overview we are a provider of skilled nursing and rehabilitative care services through the operation of facilities located in california  arizona  texas  washington  utah and idaho 
all of these facilities are skilled nursing facilities  other than three stand alone assisted living facilities in arizona and texas and four campuses that offer both skilled nursing and assisted living services in california  arizona and utah 
our facilities provide a broad spectrum of skilled nursing and assisted living services  physical  occupational and speech therapies  and other rehabilitative and healthcare services  for both long term residents and short stay rehabilitation patients 
we encourage and empower our facility leaders and staff to make their facility the facility of choice in the community it serves 
this means that our facility leaders and staff are generally free to discern and address the unique needs and priorities of healthcare professionals  customers and other stakeholders in the local community or market  and then work to create a superior service offering and reputation for that particular community or market to encourage prospective customers and referral sources to choose or recommend the facility 
as of december   we owned of our facilities and operated an additional facilities under long term lease arrangements  and had options to purchase for nine of those facilities 
the following table summarizes our facilities and licensed and independent living beds by ownership status as of december  leased with a leased without a owned purchase option purchase option total number of facilities percent of total licensed skilled nursing  assisted living and independent living beds percent of total operational skilled nursing  assisted living and independent living beds percent of total includes beds in our assisted living units and independent living units as of december  all of the independent living units are located at one of our assisted living facilities 
all bed counts are licensed beds except for independent living beds  and may not reflect the number of beds actually available for patient use 
the number of licensed and independent living beds in a skilled nursing  assisted living or independent living facility that are actually operational and available for occupancy may be less than the total official licensed bed capacity 
this sometimes occurs due to the permanent dedication of bed space to alternative purposes  such as enhanced therapy treatment space or other desirable uses calculated to improve service offerings and or operational efficiencies in a facility 
in some cases  three and four bed wards have been reduced to two bed rooms for resident comfort 
these beds are seldom expected to be placed back into service 
in addition  we occasionally acquire facilities with banked beds  for which valuable licensing rights have been retained  but have been voluntarily suspended under state regulations until the beds can be economically placed into service again 
the ensign group  inc is a holding company with no direct operating assets  employees or revenues 
all of our facilities are operated by separate  wholly owned  independent subsidiaries  which have their own management  employees and assets 
in addition  one of our wholly owned independent subsidiaries  which we call our service center  provides centralized accounting  payroll  human resources  information technology  legal  risk management 
table of contents and other services to each operating subsidiary through contractual relationships between such subsidiaries 
in addition  we have the captive that provides some claims made coverage to our operating subsidiaries for general and professional liability  as well as for certain workers compensation insurance liabilities 
references herein to the consolidated company and its assets and activities  as well as the use of the terms we  us  our and similar verbiage in this annual report is not meant to imply that the ensign group  inc has direct operating assets  employees or revenue  or that any of the facilities  the service center or the captive insurance subsidiary are operated by the same entity 
and recent developments on may   we assumed an existing lease for a licensed  or operational bed skilled nursing facility in orem  utah 
we purchased the tenant s rights under the lease agreement from the prior tenant and operator for approximately million 
we did not acquire any material assets or assume any liabilities other than the prior tenant s post assumption rights and obligations under the lease 
we also entered into a separate operations transfer agreement with the prior tenant as a part of this transaction  which is common 
we paid for the prior tenant s lease rights in cash from our ipo proceeds 
also on may   under the terms of a purchase option contained in the original lease agreement  we purchased the underlying assets of one of our leased long term care facilities in scottsdale  arizona 
this facility was purchased for approximately million  which was paid in cash from our ipo proceeds 
lastly  on may   we purchased the underlying assets of one of our leased long term care facilities in draper  utah 
this facility was purchased for approximately million  which was paid in cash from our ipo proceeds 
on october   four of our subsidiaries purchased the underlying assets of one of our leased long term care facilities in california and three of our long term care facilities in texas 
these facilities were purchased for an aggregate price of approximately million  which was paid in cash from our ipo proceeds 
the lease agreements associated with these properties did not contain purchase options 
in december  we entered into a capital lease and assumed the operations of a skilled nursing facility in salt lake city  utah adding an additional licensed  or operational beds 
no additional material consideration was paid and we did not purchase any assets or assume any liabilities  other than our rights and obligations under the lease and operations transfer agreement  as part of this transaction 
the lease agreement includes an option to purchase the underlying property from the property owner for million anytime after the initial lease date 
on january   we assumed an existing lease for a licensed and operational bed skilled nursing facility in san luis obispo  california 
we purchased the tenant s rights under the lease agreement from the prior tenant and operator for approximately million  which was paid in cash 
we did not acquire any material assets or assume any liabilities other than the prior tenant s post assumption rights and obligations under the lease 
consistent with our acquisition practices  we also entered into a separate operations transfer agreement with the prior tenant as a part of this transaction  which is common 
in addition  on january   we acquired a licensed and operational bed skilled nursing facility in lufkin  texas for approximately million  which was paid in cash 
on january   we assumed the operations of a skilled nursing facility in riverside  california which is also licensed for assisted living and independent living services 
this acquisition added licensed and operational skilled nursing  licensed  or operational assisted living and independent living beds to our operations 
on february   we purchased three skilled nursing facilities and one assisted living facility in colorado for approximately million  which was paid in cash 
this acquisition added licensed  or operational skilled nursing and licensed  or operational assisted living beds to our operations 
key performance indicators we manage our skilled nursing business by monitoring key performance indicators that affect our financial performance 
these indicators and their definitions include the following routine revenue routine revenue is generated by the contracted daily rate charged for all contractually inclusive services 
the inclusion of therapy and other ancillary treatments varies by payor source and by 
table of contents contract 
services provided outside of the routine contractual agreement are recorded separately as ancillary revenue  including medicare part b therapy services  and are not included in the routine revenue definition 
in addition  routine revenue does not include revenue generated by our assisted living business 
skilled revenue the amount of routine revenue generated from patients in our skilled nursing facilities who are receiving care under medicare or managed care reimbursement  referred to as medicare and managed care patients 
skilled revenue excludes any revenue generated from our assisted living services 
skilled mix the amount of our skilled revenue as a percentage of our total routine revenue 
skilled mix in days represents the number of days our medicare and managed care patients are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities divided by the total number of days patients from all payor sources are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities for any given measurement period 
quality mix the amount of routine non medicaid revenue as a percentage of our total routine revenue 
quality mix in days represents the number of days our non medicaid patients are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities divided by the total number of days patients from all payor sources are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities for any given measurement period 
average daily rates the routine revenue by payor source for a period at our skilled nursing facilities divided by actual patient days for that revenue source for any given measurement period 
occupancy percentage licensed beds the total number of residents occupying a bed in a skilled nursing  assisted living or independent living facility as a percentage of the number of licensed and independent living beds in the facility during any given measurement period 
occupancy percentage operational beds the total number of residents occupying a bed in a skilled nursing  assisted living or independent living facility as a percentage of the beds in a facility which are available for occupancy during any given measurement period 
number of facilities and licensed beds the total number of skilled nursing  assisted living and independent living facilities that we own or operate and the total number of licensed and independent living beds associated with these facilities 
independent living beds do not have a licensing requirement 
skilled and quality mix 
like most skilled nursing providers  we measure both patient days and revenue by payor 
medicare and managed care patients  whom we refer to as high acuity patients  typically require a higher level of skilled nursing and rehabilitative care 
accordingly  medicare and managed care reimbursement rates are typically higher than from other payors 
in most states  medicaid reimbursement rates are generally the lowest of all payor types 
changes in the payor mix can significantly affect our revenue and profitability 
the following table summarizes our skilled mix and quality mix for the periods indicated as a percentage of our total routine revenue less revenue from assisted living services and as a percentage of total patient days year ended december  skilled mix days revenue quality mix days revenue occupancy 
we have historically defined occupancy as the ratio of actual patient days one patient day equals one resident occupying one bed for one day during any measurement period to the number of licensed patient days for that period 
licensed patient days are determined by multiplying the total of officially licensed beds by the number of calendar days in the measurement period 
however  the number of licensed and independent living beds in a skilled nursing  assisted living or independent living facility that are actually operational and available for occupancy may be less than the total 
table of contents official licensed bed capacity 
this sometimes occurs due to the permanent dedication of bed space to alternative purposes  such as enhanced therapy treatment space or other desirable uses calculated to improve service offerings and or operational efficiencies in a facility 
in some cases  three and four bed wards have been reduced to two bed rooms for resident comfort  and larger wards have been reduced to conform to changes in medicare requirements 
these beds are seldom expected to be placed back into service 
in addition  we occasionally acquire facilities with banked beds  for which valuable licensing rights have been retained  but have been voluntarily suspended under state regulations until the beds can be economically placed into service again 
we define occupancy in operational beds as the ratio of actual patient days during any measurement period to the number of available patient days for that period 
available patient days are determined by subtracting non operational licensed beds from total licensed beds  and multiplying the difference by the number of calendar days in the measurement period 
we believe that reporting occupancy based on operational beds is consistent with industry practices and provides a more useful measure of actual occupancy performance from period to period 
therefore  we intend to cease reporting occupancy based on all licensed beds beginning in fiscal year the following table summarizes our occupancy statistics for the periods indicated year ended december  occupancy licensed and independent living beds at end of period operational beds at end of period available patient days licensed beds available patient days operational beds actual patient days occupancy percentage based on licensed beds occupancy percentage based on operational beds the number of licensed beds is calculated using the historical number of beds licensed at each facility 
all bed counts are licensed beds except for independent living beds  and may not reflect the number of beds actually available for patient use 
the number of licensed and independent living beds in a skilled nursing  assisted living or independent living facility that are actually operational and available for occupancy may be less than the total official licensed bed capacity 
this sometimes occurs due to the permanent dedication of bed space to alternative purposes  such as enhanced therapy treatment space or other desirable uses calculated to improve service offerings and or operational efficiencies in a facility 
in some cases  three and four bed wards have been reduced to two bed rooms for resident comfort 
these beds are seldom expected to be placed back into service 
in addition  we occasionally acquire facilities with banked beds  for which valuable licensing rights have been retained  but have been voluntarily suspended under state regulations until the beds can be economically placed into service again 
revenue sources our total revenue represents revenue derived primarily from providing services to patients and residents of skilled nursing facilities  and to a lesser extent from assisted living facilities and ancillary services 
we receive service revenue from medicaid  medicare  private payors and other third party payors  and managed care sources 
the sources and amounts of our revenue are determined by a number of factors  including bed capacity and occupancy rates of our healthcare facilities  the mix of patients at our facilities and the rates of reimbursement among payors 
payment for ancillary services varies based upon the service provided and the type of payor 
the 
table of contents following table sets forth our total revenue by payor source and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands revenue medicare managed care private and other medicaid total revenue includes revenue from assisted living facilities 
primary components of expense cost of services exclusive of facility rent and depreciation and amortization shown separately 
our cost of services represents the costs of operating our facilities and primarily consists of payroll and related benefits  supplies  purchased services  and ancillary expenses such as the cost of pharmacy and therapy services provided to residents 
cost of services also includes the cost of general and professional liability insurance and other general cost of services with respect to our facilities 
facility rent cost of services 
facility rent cost of services consists solely of base minimum rent amounts payable under lease agreements to third party owners of the facilities that we operate but do not own and does not include taxes  insurance  impounds  capital reserves or other charges payable under the applicable lease agreements 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of payroll and related benefits and travel expenses for our administrative service center personnel  including training and other operational support 
general and administrative expense also includes professional fees including accounting and legal fees  costs relating to our information systems  stock based compensation and rent for our service center office 
we expect our general and administrative expense to remain approximately the same  as a percentage of revenue  as in the future as a result of becoming a public company 
depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are recorded at their original historical cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets 
the following is a summary of the depreciable lives of our depreciable assets buildings and improvements to years leasehold improvements shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life  generally to years furniture and equipment to years critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis we review our judgments and estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  income taxes  stock compensation  intangible assets and loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments upon our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our belief of what 
table of contents could occur in the future considering available information  including assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  for revenue recognition 
under sab  four conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is reasonably assured 
our revenue is derived primarily from providing long term healthcare services to residents and is recognized on the date services are provided at amounts billable to individual residents 
for residents under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including medicaid  medicare and private insurers  revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon amounts on a per patient  daily basis 
revenue from the medicare and medicaid programs accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we record our revenue from these governmental and managed care programs as services are performed at their expected net realizable amounts under these programs 
our revenue from governmental and managed care programs is subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by governmental and third party agencies 
consistent with healthcare industry accounting practices  any changes to these revenue estimates are recorded in the period the change or adjustment becomes known based on final settlements 
we recorded retroactive adjustments that increased revenue by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
because of the complexity of the laws and regulations governing medicare and medicaid assistance programs  our estimates may potentially change by a material amount 
we record our revenue from private pay patients as services are performed 
also  see note for further discussion 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are comprised of amounts due from patients and residents  medicare and medicaid payor programs  third party insurance payors and other nursing facilities and customers 
we value our receivables based on the net amount we expect to receive from these payors 
in evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  management considers a number of factors including changes in collection patterns  accounts receivable aging trends by payor category and the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors 
the percentages applied to our aged receivable balances for purposes of establishing allowances for doubtful accounts are based on our historical experience and time limits  if any  for managed care  medicare and medicaid 
we periodically refine our procedures for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts based on experience with the estimation process and changes in circumstances 
our receivables from medicare and medicaid payor programs accounted for approximately and of our total accounts receivable as of december  and  respectively  and represents our only significant concentration of credit risk 
self insurance we are partially self insured for general and professional liability up to a base amount per claim the self insured retention with an aggregate  one time deductible above this limit 
losses beyond these amounts are insured through third party policies with coverage limits per occurrence  per location and on an aggregate basis for our company 
for claims made in  the self insured retention was million per claim with a million deductible 
as of december   the third party coverage above these limits was million per occurrence  million per facility with a million blanket aggregate 
the self insured retention and deductible limits for general and professional liability and worker s compensation are self insured through the captive  the related assets and liabilities of which are included in the 
table of contents accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the captive is subject to certain statutory requirements as an insurance provider 
these requirements include  but are not limited to  maintaining statutory capital 
our policy is to accrue amounts equal to the actuarially estimated costs to settle open claims of insureds  as well as an estimate of the cost of insured claims that have been incurred but not reported 
we develop information about the size of the ultimate claims based on historical experience  current industry information and actuarial analysis  and evaluate the estimates for claim loss exposure on a quarterly basis 
accrued general liability and professional malpractice liabilities recorded on an undiscounted basis in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our operating subsidiaries are self insured for workers compensation liability in california 
to protect ourselves against loss exposure in california  with this policy  we have purchased individual stop loss insurance coverage that insures individual claims that exceed million for each claim 
in texas  our operating subsidiaries have elected non subscriber status for workers compensation claims 
our operating subsidiaries in other states have third party guaranteed cost coverage 
in california and texas  we accrue amounts equal to the estimated costs to settle open claims  as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
we use actuarial valuations to estimate the liability based on historical experience and industry information 
accrued workers compensation liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during and  our california and arizona operating subsidiaries were insured for workers compensation liability by a third party carrier under a policy where the retrospective premium was adjusted annually based on incurred developed losses and allocated expenses 
based on a comparison of the computed retrospective premium to the actual payments funded  amounts will be due to the insurer or insured 
the term for this policy expired and all remaining balances were settled with the insurance carrier during the quarter ended september  the funded accrual in excess of the estimated liabilities is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and was and million as of december  and  respectively 
we provide self insured medical including prescription drugs and dental healthcare benefits to the majority of our employees 
we are fully liable for all financial and legal aspects of these benefit plans 
to protect ourselves against loss exposure with this policy  we have purchased individual stop loss insurance coverage that insures individual claims that exceed million for each covered person  which resets every plan year or a lifetime maximum of million per each covered person s lifetime on the ppo plan and unlimited on the hmo plan 
we have also purchased aggregate stop loss coverage that reimburses the plan up to million to the extent that paid claims exceed million 
the aforementioned coverage only applies to claims paid during the plan year 
our accrued liability under these plans recorded on an undiscounted basis in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets was million at december  and  respectively 
we believe that adequate provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for liabilities that may arise out of patient care  workers compensation  healthcare benefits and related services provided to date 
the amount of our reserves was determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data 
this estimation process requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of the claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about emerging trends  we  with the assistance of an independent actuary  develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on our historical experience and other available industry information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs  the expected cost of claims incurred but not reported and the expected costs to settle or pay damage awards with respect to unpaid claims 
it is possible  however  that the actual liabilities may exceed our estimate of loss 
the self insured liabilities are based upon estimates  and while management believes that the estimates of loss are reasonable  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the recorded amounts 
due to the inherent volatility of actuarially determined loss estimates  it is reasonably possible that we could experience changes in estimated losses that could be material to net income 
if our actual liability exceeds its estimate of loss  its future earnings and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets that are held and used in our operations for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon expected undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  utilizing management s best estimate  appropriate assumptions  and projections at the time 
if the carrying value is determined to be unrecoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of the asset 
we estimate the fair value of assets based on the estimated future discounted cash flows of the asset 
management has evaluated its long lived assets and has not identified any impairment as of december  intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist primarily of deferred financing costs  favorable lease  lease acquisition costs and trade names 
deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the related debt  ranging from five to years 
favorable leases and lease acquisition costs are amortized over the life of the lease of the facility  ranging from ten to years 
trade names are amortized over years 
goodwill is accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is subject to annual testing for impairment 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we define reporting units as the individual facilities 
we perform our annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year 
we did not record any impairment charges during the year ended december  if the seven facilities with goodwill were to experience circumstances that would reduce their fair value below its carrying amount  we could record a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
stock based compensation as of january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options based on estimated fair values  ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
net income has been reduced as a result of the recognition of the fair value of all stock options issued on and subsequent to january   the amount of which is contingent upon the number of future options granted and other variables 
we have recognized million  million and million in compensation expense during the years ended december   and  respectively 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no

under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the temporary differences are primarily attributable to compensation accruals  straight line rent adjustments and reserves for doubtful accounts and insurance liabilities 
when necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in considering the need for a valuation allowance against some portion or all of its deferred tax assets  we must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income  the feasibility of tax planning strategies and other factors 
estimates and judgments regarding deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance  if any  are based on  among other things  knowledge of operations  markets  historical trends and likely future changes and  when 
table of contents appropriate  the opinions of advisors with knowledge and expertise in certain fields 
however  due to the nature of certain assets and liabilities  there are risks and uncertainties associated with some of our estimates and judgments 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the net deferred tax assets as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
we expect to fully utilize these deferred tax assets  however  their ultimate realization is dependent upon the amount of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
as of january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires us to maintain a liability for underpayment of income taxes and related interest and penalties  if any  for uncertain income tax positions 
in considering the need for and magnitude of a liability for uncertain income tax positions  we must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the amount of income tax benefit that will ultimately be realized 
the ultimate resolution of an uncertain tax position may not be known for a number of years  during which time we may be required to adjust these reserves  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
we used an estimate of our annual income tax rate to recognize a provision for income taxes in financial statements for interim periods 
however  changes in facts and circumstances could result in adjustments to our effective tax rate in future quarterly or annual periods 
acquisition policy we periodically enter into agreements to acquire assets and or businesses 
the considerations involved in each of these agreements may include cash  financing  and or long term lease arrangements for real properties 
we evaluate each transaction to determine whether the acquired interests are assets or businesses using the framework provided by emerging issue task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business eitf 
eitf defines a business as a self sustaining integrated set of activities and assets conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors 
a business consists of a input  b processes applied to those inputs  and c resulting outputs that are used to generate revenues 
in order for an acquired set of activities and assets to be a business  it must contain all of the inputs and processes necessary for it to continue to conduct normal operations after the acquired entity is separated from the seller  including the ability to sustain a revenue stream by providing its outputs to customers 
an acquired set of activities and assets fail the definition of a business if it excludes one or more of the above items such that it is not possible to continue normal operations and sustain a revenue stream by providing its products and or services to customers 
leases and leasehold improvements we account for leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases sfas  and other related guidance 
at the inception of each lease  we perform an evaluation to determine whether the lease should be classified as an operating or capital lease 
we record rent expense for leases that contain scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we are given control of the leased premises through the end of the lease term  as established in accordance with sfas the lease term used for this evaluation also provides the basis for establishing depreciable lives for buildings subject to lease and leasehold improvements  as well as the period over which we record straight line rent expense 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas the provisions of sfas r are similar to those of sfas  however  sfas r requires companies to record most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination at full fair value

due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio

in march  we and certain of our officers received a series of notices from our bank indicating that the united states attorney for the central district of california had issued an authorized investigative demand  a request for records similar to a subpoena  to our bank

the 
table of contents rescinded demand requested documents from our bank related to financial transactions involving us  ten of our operating subsidiaries  an outside investor group  and certain of our current and former officers 
subsequently  in june of  the us attorney sent a letter to one of our current employees requesting a meeting 
the letter indicated that the us attorney and the us department of health and human services office of inspector general were conducting an investigation of claims submitted to the medicare program for rehabilitation services provided at unspecified facilities 
although both we and the employee offered to cooperate  the us attorney later withdrew its meeting request 
on december   we were informed by deloitte touche llp  our independent registered public accounting firm that the us attorney served a grand jury subpoena on deloitte touche llp  relating to the ensign group  inc  and several of our operating subsidiaries 
the subpoena confirmed our previously reported belief that the us attorney was conducting an investigation involving facilities operated by certain of our operating subsidiaries 
all together  the march authorized investigative demand and the december subpoena specifically covered information from a total of of our facilities 
in february  the us attorney contacted two additional current employees 
both we and the employees contacted have offered to cooperate and meet with the us attorney  however  to date  the us attorney has declined these offers 
based on these events  we believe that the us attorney may be conducting parallel criminal  civil and administrative investigations involving the ensign group and one or more of our skilled nursing facilities 
pursuant to these investigations  on december   representatives from the us department of justice doj served search warrants on our service center and six of our southern california skilled nursing facilities 
following the execution of the warrants on the six facilities  a subpoena was issued covering eight additional facilities 
we and our regulatory counsel are actively working with the us attorney s office to determine what additional documents will be assistive to their inquiry  and to help target the scope of the production  pursuant to the subpoena  to those documents 
we are cooperating with the us attorney s office  and will continue working with them to the extent they will allow us to help move their inquiry forward 
to our knowledge  however  neither the ensign group  inc nor any of our operating subsidiaries or employees has been formally charged with any wrongdoing 
we cannot predict or provide any assurance as to the possible outcome of the investigation or any possible related proceedings  or as to the possible outcome of any qui tam litigation that may follow  nor can we estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result from any such proceedings and  therefore  we have not recorded any related accruals 
to the extent the us attorney s office elects to pursue this matter  or if the investigation has been instigated by a qui tam relator who elects to pursue the matter  and we are subjected to or alleged to be liable for claims or obligations under federal medicare statutes  the federal false claims act  or similar state and federal statutes and related regulations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline 
we initiated an internal investigation in november when we became aware of an allegation of possible reimbursement irregularities at one or more of our facilities 
this investigation focused on facilities  and included all six of the facilities which were covered by the warrants served in december we retained outside counsel to assist us in looking into these matters 
we and our outside counsel concluded this investigation in february without identifying any systemic or patterns and practices of fraudulent or intentional misconduct 
we made observations at certain facilities regarding areas of potential improvement in some of our recordkeeping and billing practices and have implemented measures  some of which were already underway before the investigation began  that we believe will strengthen our recordkeeping and billing processes 
none of these additional findings or observations appears to be rooted in fraudulent or intentional misconduct 
we continue to evaluate the measures we have implemented for effectiveness  and we are continuing to seek ways to improve these processes 
as a byproduct of our investigation we identified a limited number of selected medicare claims for which adequate backup documentation could not be located or for which other billing deficiencies existed 
we  with the assistance of independent consultants experienced in medicare billing  completed a billing review on these claims 
to the extent missing documentation was not located  we treated the claims as overpayments 
consistent with healthcare industry accounting practices  we record any charge for refunded payments against revenue in the period in which the claim adjustment becomes known 
during the year ended december   we accrued a liability of 
table of contents approximately million  plus interest  for selected medicare claims for which documentation has not been located or for other billing deficiencies identified to date 
these claims have been submitted for settlement with the medicare fiscal intermediary 
if additional reviews result in identification and quantification of additional amounts to be refunded  we would accrue additional liabilities for claim costs and interest  and repay any amounts due in normal course 
if future investigations ultimately result in findings of significant billing and reimbursement noncompliance which could require us to record significant additional provisions or remit payments  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline 
see additional description of our contingencies in notes and in notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from the medicare program 
we also derive revenue from state medicaid and similar reimbursement programs 
payments under these programs generally provide for reimbursement levels that are adjusted for inflation annually based upon the state s fiscal year for the medicaid programs and in each october for the medicare program 
these adjustments may not continue in the future  and even if received  such adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in our costs for providing healthcare services 
labor and supply expenses make up a substantial portion of our cost of services 
those expenses can be subject to increase in periods of rising inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
to date  we have generally been able to implement cost control measures or obtain increases in reimbursement sufficient to offset increases in these expenses 
we may not be successful in offsetting future cost increases 
off balance sheet and other arrangements as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of borrowing capacity on the revolver pledged as collateral to secure outstanding letters of credit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate changes in connection with the revolver  which is available but is not regularly used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to provide more predictability to our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we borrow primarily at fixed rates  although the revolver is available and could be used for short term borrowing purposes 
at december   we had no outstanding floating rate debt 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  consisted of bank term deposits  money market funds and treasury bill related investments 
our market risk exposure is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because our investments are in cash equivalents 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
the above only incorporates those exposures that exist as of december   and does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
if we diversify our investment portfolio into securities and other investment alternatives  we may face increased risk and exposures as a result of interest risk and the securities markets in general
