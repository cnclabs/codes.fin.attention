overview we design  develop and market a family of innovative technology based learning platforms and related proprietary content for children of all ages at home and in schools around the world 
we have created more than interactive software titles  covering important subjects such as phonics  reading  writing and math 
in addition  we have a broad line of stand alone educational products  or toys  that do not require the separate purchase of software and are generally targeted at young children from infants to five year olds 
our products are available in six languages and are sold globally through retailers  distributors and directly to schools 
our goal is to create educational products that kids love  parents trust and teachers value 
we generate revenue from developing  manufacturing  and selling platform hardware including the tag and leap pad reading systems  classic leapster  leapster and didj gaming platforms  and the clickstart my first computer learning computer  along with a range of learning toys 
we also generate revenue from developing and licensing a wide range of content for our platforms 
in  we introduced the learning path  a web based service that helps parents track what their children are learning with our web connected products in the united states and canada and in early in the united kingdom 
learning path gives our consumers access to a variety of downloadable content and to online rewards programs that encourage learning  as well as making it easier for our consumers to age up with our products 
parents are able to see the learning and gain personalized insight into their child s learning progress 
some of our products  including the tag reading system  which was launched in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and france  and the leapster handheld gaming system  which was launched in the united states  canada  and the united kingdom  are designed to be connected to the learning path 
we expect to introduce learning path in other leapfrog international markets in our business is highly seasonal with a significant portion of our revenues occurring in the second half of the year 
given relatively low sales volumes in the first half of the calendar year and the relatively fixed nature of many of our operating expenses which occur fairly evenly throughout the year  our results of operations are generally stronger in our third and fourth quarters relative to our first and second quarters 
conversely  our cash flow from operations tends to be highest in the first quarter of the year when we collect the majority of our accounts receivable related to the prior year s fourth quarter sales 
cash flow from operations generally tends to be lowest in our third quarter  as accounts receivables collections taper off and we are building inventory in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season 
however  as discussed below  this pattern may differ in based on declines in sales in the fourth quarter of the reduction in cash flow in the third quarter generally means that our available cash is at its lowest point for the year in the first month of the fourth quarter 
we borrowed on our asset backed line of credit facility in october to provide sufficient liquidity for fourth quarter operations 
we repaid the borrowed funds by year end from cash provided by operations during the quarter 
in  the global economic crisis led to a severe decline in sales in the fourth quarter of our sales for the fourth quarter of were significantly below our expectations and constituted a substantially smaller percentage of our annual sales than they have in previous years 
fourth quarter sales in and were and of total net sales for those years  respectively 
however in  our fourth quarter net sales were only of total net sales for the year 
our fourth quarter net sales declined by in compared to given the seasonality of our business  declines in sales in the third and fourth quarters can have a disproportionate impact on our annual operating results as well as our cash flows from operations at the beginning of the following year 

table of contents we continue to invest in research and development of existing and new lines of business that we believe may contribute to our long term growth 
we also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future hardware platforms and content  providing for standalone and online experiences 
we believe delivering innovative and high value solutions through our platforms and online experiences is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth 
since we have focused on reducing our cost structure by improving efficiency in our operations and eliminating unnecessary expenditures 
this effort has included headcount reductions  migration of certain aspects of our product development cycle to external parties and a restructuring in the fourth quarter of involving the closure of some of our offices and a company wide reduction in force  including employees in our former school business segment 
during  we will continue our efforts to reduce our cost structure by continuing to implement process improvements and other efficiencies 
in light of the continuing economic uncertainty affecting  we plan to invest our resources with particular focus on improving cash flow 
thus  we will continue to focus our research and development  or r d  resources on building out our core product lines and adding to our content library  as well as further reducing other expenditures  particularly those related to selling  general and administrative activities to correspond to our best ongoing estimates of consumer spending trends 
in and succeeding years we plan to introduce new products in our reading solutions  educational gaming  and learning toy product lines 
additional focus will be placed on expanding our content library  establishing parents familiarity with the learning path  and expanding our online play components 
the next few years will reflect more methodical efforts to concurrently launch our core product range internationally to boost our performance outside of the us  as well as to drive efficiencies and reduce costs throughout the company 
we are also pursuing partnership relationships with third party school publishers and developers to render some of their proprietary content compatible with selected leapfrog technology platforms 
we face significant risks associated with the economic downturn and continuing uncertainty through at least weak sales in the fourth quarter of meant that retailers built up inventories of our products  which could harm our sales in the first part of and beyond 
in addition  an increasing number of retailers have encountered liquidity problems 
if any of our most significant retailers suspend or reduce payments to us or declare bankruptcy  or file for bankruptcy  the resulting bad debt expense we would incur would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the potential business risk for us from macroeconomic conditions anticipated for is discussed further in part i 
item a 
risk factors the current economic crisis had a material adverse effect on our sales in  and we cannot be certain when sales will recover  retailer liquidity problems could harm our liquidity and financial results in and our liquidity may be insufficient to meet the long term or periodic needs of our business 
we organize  operate and assess our business in two primary operating segments united states and international 
historically  we operated a school segment that sold products tailored for the united states educational market directly to schools  teacher supply stores and through catalogs and websites aimed at educators 
during  we significantly reduced our direct marketing to the educational channel  reduced headcount and direct facilities expenses accordingly  and transferred responsibility for this sales channel to the former us consumer operating segment 
this is consistent with how the chief operating decision maker reviews performance  allocates resources and manages the business 
accordingly  we have consolidated and reclassified the results of the former us consumer and school segments into the united states segment for the fiscal years ended december   and see footnote segment reporting in our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for certain detailed information on our segments and their financial results  our customers and our products for the fiscal years ended december   and

foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million or a decrease in net sales during the year 
net sales related to new platform products and related content introduced in totaled approximately million  or of total net sales 
gross margin percentage improved slightly as new products launched in generally had higher margins and we did not experience the same level of asset write offs as in specifically  the large unamortized balances of the fly fusion related assets were written down to reflect declining sales trends in these improvements to gross margin were partially offset by lower sales through the school channel  increased discounting  higher sales returns allowances related to weakening consumer demand and higher than expected retail inventory levels at the end of  and costs associated with a voluntary recall of the didj recharging station 
operating expenses declined reflecting reduced headcount related expenses and the absence of costs for legal settlements  offset slightly by an increase in bad debt expense 
over the past three years we have focused on reducing our cost structure through driving efficiencies 
total fulltime employees declined by  or  from december  to december   due to a combination of reductions in force and the migration of certain aspects of our product development cycle to external parties 
legal costs were considerably lower in as included million in patent defense and settlement expenses associated with a patent lawsuit 
bad debt expense increased by million in due to several customer bankruptcies as well as an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts given the weakening retail environment 
the combination of higher net sales and declining operating expenses resulted in an improvement in loss from operations

foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million or a increase in net sales during the year 
gross margin improved by percentage points in  primarily due to providing lower allowances for excess and obsolete inventories  a higher ratio of sales of higher margin products to total net sales and sales of previously written down inventory  partially offset by a write off of our fly fusion related assets to levels consistent with the then expected future sales trends 
operating expenses increased slightly  reflecting higher selling  general and administrative and research and development costs  offset somewhat by lower advertising cost 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was driven by increased legal and settlement costs related to a patent lawsuit 
research and development costs increased due to the extensive product introductions slated for and advertising expenses declined due to lower retail inventory levels which had a direct impact on sales and promotion allowances 
loss from operations improved by  primarily due to the improvement in gross profit 
although net sales decreased  cost of sales improved by  primarily due to improved inventory management  which resulted in lower allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
basic and diluted net loss per share improved by due to the decrease in our total net loss as the weighted average of basic and diluted common shares outstanding remained relatively level from year to year 
summary of results by segment for fiscal years ended december   and the net sales  gross margin  total operating expenses and operating loss amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and on an operating segment basis as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  sfas  which is consistent with our internal management reporting structure 
during we significantly reduced our direct marketing to the educational channel  reduced headcount and direct facilities expenses accordingly  and transferred responsibility for this sales channel to the former u 
s consumer operating segment 
accordingly  and following the guidance in sfas  we consolidated our school segment into our us consumer segment  which was renamed the united states segment 
all prior year school segment related data has been combined into the united states us segment and prior period financial data has been recast to conform to the current presentation 
certain corporate level costs  including expenses related to corporate operations associated with broad based sales and marketing  product support services  human resources  legal  finance  information technology  corporate development and procurement activities  broad based research and development costs  legal settlements and other corporate costs are charged entirely to our us segment  rather than being allocated between the us and international segments 
united states segment the us segment includes net sales and related expenses directly associated with selling our products to national and regional mass market and specialty retailers  other retail stores and distributors and school related distributors and resellers through a combination of sales representatives 
we also sell our products through our online store and other internet based channels 

table of contents change change vs

dollars in millions net sales gross margin operating expenses loss from operations gross profit as a percentage of net sales percentage point change in gross margin fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales increased primarily due to the strong performance of platform and related content products associated with the key product launches of tag  leapster and didj and solid net growth in leapfrog 
com  offset by declining sales of older products such as the classic leapster  leappad  little leaps  leaptrack and other school market related products 
net sales related to new platform products and related content introduced in totaled approximately million  or of total united states net sales 
additionally  the ratio of platforms sold as a percentage of total net sales increased to in as compared to and in and  respectively 
the increase in the ratio of platforms to net sales in was driven by the tag  leapster and didj launches  typically  new platform related software sales lag platform adoption for a period after the platform is initially released for sale 
gross margin remained level at year over year reflecting a number of offsetting factors 
the gross margin benefited from sales of new  higher margin products launched during the year  lower asset write offs than those experienced in  specifically the fly fusion assets which were written down to reflect declining sales trends in  and reductions in the allowances for unclaimed reimbursements due to customers under promotional and co operative advertising agreements  based on lack of customer performance and aging of the claim 
these improvements were essentially offset by lower sales through the school channel  increased discounting and higher sales returns allowances related to weakening consumer demand and higher than expected retail inventory levels at the end of and costs associated with a voluntary recall of the didj recharging station 
loss from operations improved  reflecting the net sales increase and a decline in operating expenses 
the decrease in operating expenses is largely a result of lower headcount related expenses due to headcount reductions and lower legal and settlement costs in fiscal year compared to fiscal year us net sales constituted of leapfrog s total net sales for both and net sales in the us decreased as the decline in sales of products being phased out and the decline in school related revenue offset the cost savings from the migration of certain aspects of our product development cycle to external parties  relatively robust growth on leapfrog 
com and strong sales of our classic leapster products 

table of contents our gross margin improved significantly in as compared to due to lower allowances for excess and obsolete inventory and an increased ratio of higher margin products sold to total net sales in these positive effects were partially offset by a non cash write off of million in associated with fly fusion related assets  which was made to bring the carrying values of the assets to levels we believed were recoverable  given the then expected future sales trends 
the fly fusion assets included inventories  advance royalty payments  tooling equipment and capitalized content 
the write off negatively impacted the gross margin by approximately percentage points 
loss from operations improved  reflecting an increase in gross profit during the year 
the decline in net sales was more than offset by a decline in cost of sales 
the improvement in cost of sales was primarily attributable to providing lower allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
outlook given higher than expected retail inventory levels and the current economic crisis  we expect our net sales to lag behind any improvement in our retailers sales to consumers  which will depress sales during the first part of we expect content sales will represent a higher percentage of net sales  which we expect to lead to improvements in gross margin 
we anticipate that further planned reductions in expenditures  primarily due to the decreased headcount  should result in improving our operating results and net cash flows 
international segment the international segment includes the net sales and related expenses directly associated with selling our products to national and regional mass market and specialty retailers and other outlets through the leapfrog offices in the united kingdom  france  canada and mexico as well as through distributors in markets such as spain  germany and australia

our gross margin percentage remained relatively constant  decreasing one percentage point in although during the second half of there was an increase in sales of higher gross margin products  this improvement was offset by a weighted average decline in the value of the dollar during the fourth quarter of approximately

impairment losses on our auction rate securities ars increased in as the general economic uncertainty and adverse credit market conditions deepened  driving lower valuations of these securities 
the other  net category consists primarily of gains losses on foreign exchange forward contracts  net of gains losses on the underlying transactions denominated in foreign currency 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year other income expense declined in relative to  primarily due to the impairment charge of million related to our ars investment which was recorded in the fourth quarter of the impairment resulted from the deteriorating economy and the related auction failures held for ars securities which severely impacted their liquidity and market values 

table of contents income taxes our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rates were million  million and million  and  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our pretax losses were million  million and million for the same periods  respectively 
calculation of the effective tax rates for all periods included a non cash valuation allowance recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets 
the tax expense for and was primarily attributable to our foreign operations 
in we received an income tax refund of million from the irs in settlement of an audit related to our research and development carryback claims for the years through the total tax benefit attributable to this refund was million  including interest paid by the irs 
tax expense for included a valuation allowance of million related to pre deferred tax assets  the remaining tax expense was largely attributable to our foreign operations 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
all cash equivalents were invested money market funds that held only high grade united states government obligations at december  at the end of we made a policy decision to invest our excess cash in short term us government obligations only due to the continuing financial market crisis 
as of december   we held million  stated at fair value  in long term investments in auction rate securities 
the uncertainties in the credit and financial markets since the fourth quarter of have prevented us from liquidating our ars holdings as the amount of securities submitted for sale in periodic auctions has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
the fair value of our auction rate securities investment has declined by million from its original cost value of million  resulting in a total unrealized loss of the same amount  which has been recorded as a loss on investments in our statements of operations in the appropriate periods 
due to the illiquidity of these investments we have not included and do not intend  for the foreseeable future  to include them as potential sources of liquidity in our future cash flow projections 
thus  we do not anticipate that future declines in value  if any  will have an adverse impact on our future ability to support operations and meet our obligations as they come due 
because the fair value of million for the auction rate securities investment constitutes less than of our total assets at december   we also do not anticipate any material adverse impact on our overall capital position should the fair value of these investments decline to zero 
we have an asset backed revolving credit facility with a potential borrowing availability of million which is discussed in more detail below 
there were no borrowings outstanding on this line of credit at december  our retained deficit of million at december  is not expected to impact our future ability to operate  given our anticipated cash flows from operations  our strong cash position and the availability of our credit facility 
future capital expenditures are planned to be primarily for new product development and purchases related to the upgrading of our information technology capabilities 
we expect that capital expenditures in  including those for capitalized content and website development costs  will be lower than in prior years 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect future capital expenditures will be funded with cash flows generated by operations 
we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs and planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
we plan to invest where prudent  our strategies will be focused on driving sales of our learn to read and educational gaming market platforms  introducing additional connected products  expanding our content library  establishing parents familiarity with the learning path and expanding our online play components 
our ability to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures  as well as our ability to comply with all of the financial covenants of our credit facility depend on our future operating performance and cash flows  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions  including the limited availability of capital in light of the current financial crisis and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control

table of contents seasonal patterns of cash provided by or used in operations the table below shows our seasonal patterns of cash flow provided by used in operations by quarter for the fiscal years ended december   and dollars in millions st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total cash provided by used in operations generally  our cash flow from operations tends to be highest in the first quarter of the year when we collect the majority of our accounts receivable booked in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
cash flow used in operations tends to be highest in our third quarter  as collections from prior accounts receivables taper off and we invest heavily in inventory in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season 
cash flow generally turns positive again in the fourth quarter as we start to collect on the current holiday season accounts receivables 
however  our quarterly cash flows did not fully conform to our historical pattern due to the following factors 
net sales fell on a year over year basis from through this resulted in a decline in cash collected from accounts receivable from year to year for the three year period  negatively impacting cash flows in the first quarter of each subsequent year 
in  this net sales related cash flow decline was partially offset during the fourth quarter as we tightened our cash management practices in response to the economic crisis  resulting in an increase in accounts payable of approximately million at the end of as compared to the end of thus  cash flow provided by operations was higher in the fourth quarter of than in the first quarter 
as described elsewhere in this form k  decreased sales in the fourth quarter of and potential retailer liquidity issues may reduce or delay collections of cash in the first quarter of  which could mean that cash flow provided by operations in the fourth quarter of could exceed cash flow provided by operations in the first quarter of line of credit and borrowing availability in november  we entered into a million asset based revolving credit facility with bank of america 
in may we  certain banks  financial institutions and other institutional lenders and bank of america entered into an amendment to the original credit facility agreement  increasing the maximum borrowing availability on the credit line from million to million 
we granted security interests in substantially all of our assets as collateral for the loans under the credit facility agreement  as amended 
the borrowing availability varies according to the levels of our eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and cash and investment securities deposited in secured accounts with the administrative agent or other lenders 
availability under this agreement was million as of december  the termination date of the agreement and the maturity date for any outstanding loans under the facility is november  among other customary covenants  the credit facility contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
we are required to maintain a ratio of ebitda to fixed charges  as defined in the agreement  of at least to when the covenant is required to be tested 
the ratio is measured only if certain borrowing availability thresholds are not met 
we expect that we will meet or exceed these borrowing availability thresholds and be in compliance with all related requirements in the agreement also contains customary events of default and prohibits the payment of cash dividends on our common stock 
if an event of default occurs  the lenders may terminate their commitments  declare all borrowings under the credit facility as due immediately  and foreclose on the collateral 
as of december  we were in compliance with all covenants under this agreement 
bank of america is committed to lend up to of the total borrowing and wachovia capital finance corporation is committed to lend the remaining 

table of contents the interest rate for our revolving credit facility is  at our election  the bank of america prime rate or base rate or a libor rate defined in the credit agreement  plus in each case an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for a loan depends on the average monthly usage and type of loan 
we had no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december  during the fourth quarter of  we borrowed a total of million on the line and repaid million during the same quarter from cash provided by operations 
contractual obligations and commitments leapfrog has no off balance sheet arrangements 
we conduct our corporate operations from leased facilities and rent equipment under operating leases 
generally  these have initial lease periods of three to twelve years and contain provisions for renewal options of five years at market rates 
we account for rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the following table summarizes our outstanding long term contractual obligations at december  contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in millions operating leases royalty guarantees capital leases purchase obligations total at december   we had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under our asset backed line of credit facility with bank of america 
at december   we had million of potential availability on the line 
in addition  we had commitments to purchase inventory totaling approximately million at december  critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap or gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
we believe that certain accounting policies  which we refer to as critical accounting policies  are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the use of significant estimates and the application of significant judgment by our management 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  particularly those related to our critical accounting policies which include revenue recognition  evaluation of our accounts receivable related allowances for doubtful accounts  sales and product returns and cooperative advertising arrangements with customers  the valuation and nature of impairments of financial instruments  valuation and amortization of capitalized content costs  inventory valuation  the recognition  measurement and valuation of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  valuation of goodwill and stock based compensation assumptions 

table of contents revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title passes to the customer  provided that there is evidence of a commercial arrangement  delivery has occurred  there is a fixed or determinable fee and collection is reasonably assured 
for online downloads  delivery is considered to occur when the download occurs 
for professional training services  delivery is considered to occur when the training has been performed 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances based primarily on volume purchasing levels  estimated returns  allowances for defective products  markdowns and other sales allowances for customer promotions 
a small portion of our revenue related to subscriptions is recognized as revenue over the period of the subscription 
we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts we believe may become uncollectible 
determining the amounts that may become uncollectible requires judgment that may have a significant effect on the amounts reported in accounts receivable 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our management s evaluation of the customer s financial condition in the context of current economic conditions  past collection history and aging of the accounts receivable balances 
if changes in the economic climate or in the financial condition of any of our customers impair their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide estimated allowances against revenues and accounts receivable for product returns  defective products  charge backs  discounts  promotions and cooperative advertising arrangements with customers in the same period that we record the related revenue 
we estimate our allowances by utilizing our historical information for existing products 
for new products  we estimate our allowances by utilizing our historical experience with similar products 
we also take into account current inventory levels of our retailers  sell through of our retailers and distributors  current trends in retail for our products  changes in customer demand for our products and other related factors 
we continually evaluate our historical experience  changes in the current environment and adjust our allowances as appropriate 
the current challenging economic climate has impacted our estimates considerably as retailer inventory levels are much higher than normal levels and the number of retailer bankruptcies has been increasing 
changes in the assumptions underlying our estimates can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in the latter half of  as the economy and the financial condition of some of our retailers worsened  we reviewed our outstanding accounts receivable and provided allowances for specific customers based on how current their receivables were and their most recent financial information

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
our financial instruments consist of long term investments in auction rate securities ars and certain foreign currency forward contracts 
our foreign currency forward contracts are widely traded and generally have a day term  therefore we consider them to be level assets  as such  their fair values are equivalent to market value 
we have not been able to liquidate our ars since the fourth quarter of due to the adverse financial market conditions that arose at that time and that have continued to the date of this form k 
for this reason  we consider these securities to be level assets and we determine their fair value based on a variety of unobservable inputs  including our assessments of general market conditions  changes in the credit ratings of the issuers of the securities  the quality of the collateral  if any  and independent valuations of our portfolio s fair value 
we update our estimates of the fair values of our financial instruments quarterly and adjust the instruments carrying values as appropriate 
any impairment losses are classified as either temporary or other than temporary 
temporary losses are charged to other accumulated comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet and other than temporary losses are charged to the statements of operations in other income expense 
determining the appropriate classification of impairment losses requires us to make complex and subjective judgments  using currently available data as well as projections about the potential impact of possible future events and conditions  which judgments and projections are inherently uncertain

during and  we have recognized total losses of million on the ars investments  reducing their total carrying value from their original par value of million to million as of december   a reduction in value of 

table of contents inventories are stated on a first in  first out basis at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory valuation primarily involves our management s estimation of slow moving  obsolete or excess products 
our estimate of the write down for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories is based on our management s review of on hand inventories compared to their estimated future usage  our product demand forecast  anticipated product selling prices  the expected product lifecycle  and products planned for discontinuation 
if actual future usage  demand for our products and anticipated product selling prices were less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs would be required resulting in a negative impact on our gross margin 
we monitor the estimates of inventory write downs on a quarterly basis 
when considered necessary  we make additional adjustments to reduce inventory to its net realizable value  with corresponding increases to cost of goods sold 
our assessment of the pessimistic economic outlook for caused us to provide an increased reserve of approximately million for inventories in due to overstocks at some of our retailers at year end

 accounting for website development costs 
website costs presently comprise primarily third party costs related to developing applications that are an integral component of certain products we market  as well as some costs incurred to develop or acquire and customize code for web applications  costs to develop html web pages or develop templates 
we evaluate the future recoverability of website costs on a quarterly basis and if an impairment loss is considered to have occurred during the period  the loss is recorded in the statement of operations in the same period 
our evaluations of capitalized content and website costs require us to make complex and subjective judgments  using currently available data as well as projections about the potential impact of possible future events and conditions  which judgments and projections are inherently uncertain 
if future events and conditions do not meet expectations  we make additional adjustments to reduce the expected realizable value of the assets  with corresponding increases to cost of sales 
both of these capitalized costs are included in capitalized product costs on the balance sheet

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the end of each fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the applicable reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors or operating performance indicators 
application of the goodwill impairment test involves numerous assumptions  estimates and the application of significant judgment  including the identification of reporting units  evaluation of current market indicators and projections of future product sales and net cash flows  among others 
these judgments and projections are inherently uncertain 
any future impairment tests may result in a write down of goodwill and a corresponding non cash charge to earnings if we experience sales shortfalls  fail to reduce our expenses or if our market capitalization as of the measurement date exceeds the carrying value of our net assets at the same date by an amount that cannot be attributed to any specific asset on our balance sheet 
as discussed above  after analyzing our goodwill at december  and  we concluded no impairment charge was required in either period

we accrue for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin determining our income tax assets  liabilities and expense requires us to make significant estimates and judgments in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we provide valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted requires judgment about factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
our financial statements also include accruals for the estimated amounts of probable future assessments that may result from the examination of federal  state or international tax returns 
our tax accruals  tax provision  deferred tax assets or income tax liabilities may be adjusted if there are changes in circumstances  such as changes in tax law  tax audits or other factors  which may cause management to revise its estimates

stock based compensation expense may be significantly affected by changes in our stock price  our actual forfeiture rates and the extent of future grants of equity awards 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected
