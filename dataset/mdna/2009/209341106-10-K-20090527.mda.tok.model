table of contents most of our sales are generated by individual orders through commissioned sales personnel 
we recognize revenue from these orders when we deliver the ordered goods and services 
to a large extent  continued engagement of our company by our customers for successive business opportunities depends upon the customers satisfaction with the quality of products and services we provide 
as such  it is difficult for us to predict with any high degree of certainty the number  size  and profitability of printing services that we expect to provide for more than a couple of weeks in advance 
our revenues  however  tend to be strongest in the quarter ended december followed by revenue in the quarter ended march conversely  revenues tend to be seasonally weaker in the quarters ended june and september due to the current economic recession  which began in late fiscal and may potentially continue though fiscal  these seasonal trends may not have a significant impact on our sales since revenues are generally depressed 
additionally  a further deterioration in the economy would likely adversely impact our revenues and results from operations 
our cost of sales mainly consists of raw materials consumed in the printing process  as well as labor and outside services  such as delivery costs 
paper cost is the most significant component of our materials cost  however  fluctuation in paper pricing generally does not materially impact our operating margins because we typically quote  and subsequently purchase  paper for each specific printing project we are awarded 
as a result  any changes in paper pricing are effectively passed through to customers by our printing businesses 
additionally  our cost of sales includes salary and benefits paid to operating personnel  maintenance  repair  rental and insurance costs associated with operating our facilities and equipment and depreciation charges 
our selling expenses generally include the compensation paid to our sales professionals  along with promotional  travel and entertainment costs 
our general and administrative expenses generally include the salary and benefits paid to support personnel at our printing businesses and our corporate staff including stock based compensation  as well as office rent  utilities and communications expenses  various professional services and amortization of identifiable intangible assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth our company s historical consolidated income statements and certain percentage relationships for the periods indicated as a percentage of sales year ended march year ended march in millions sales cost of sales gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses goodwill impairment charge litigation charge other income  net operating income loss interest expense  net income loss before taxes income taxes net income loss our sales and expenses during the periods shown were impacted by the acquisition of three printing businesses in fiscal and two printing businesses in fiscal in accordance with the purchase method of accounting  our consolidated income statements reflect sales and expenses of acquired businesses only for post acquisition periods 
accordingly  acquisitions affect our financial results in any one year compared to the prior year by the full year impact of prior year acquisitions as compared to the partial impact in the prior year and the partial year impact of current year acquisitions 
this revenue impact is referred to below as the impact of acquisitions 
we refer to revenue growth or decline  excluding the effect of revenues contributed by acquisitions and election related business  in the most recent or prior fiscal year as internal or same store sales growth or decline

these increases were partially offset by a million decline in same store sales compared to the decline in same store sales was primarily due to a reduction in demand for printing services as a result of continuing weakness in the overall us economy  and a more competitive pricing environment 
gross profit for fiscal declined by million  or  to million from million in fiscal gross profits as a percentage of sales declined to from in fiscal due to relatively lower gross margins of businesses acquired in fiscal and the adverse effect of lower same store sales  offset  in part  by the effect of an increase in election related business and the beneficial impact of the company s growing digital print business

the company assesses the impairment of goodwill as required by sfas no 
under sfas no 
 the company determines fair value for each reporting unit using trailing twelve months earnings before interest  income taxes and depreciation and amortization ebitda multiplied by management s estimate of the total company s enterprise value to ebitda multiple  adjusted for a control premium 
management estimated a total company enterprise value to ebitda multiple based upon the multiple derived from using the market capitalization of the company s common stock around march   after considering an appropriate control premium based upon historical transactions in the printing industry 
each of the company s printing businesses is separately evaluated for goodwill impairment because they comprise individual reporting units 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the end of each fiscal year  or at any time that management becomes aware of an indication of impairment 
to the extent the net book value of the company as a whole is greater than the company s market capitalization  all or a significant portion of its goodwill may be considered impaired 
as a result of the recent decline in the market capitalization of the company during fiscal year  and a weakening operating performance outlook driven primarily by the us recession  the company concluded that a triggering event occurred for the quarter ended december  and recognized a non cash  pre tax impairment of its goodwill during that quarter of million 
in connection with the year ended march   the company performed an additional  required annual impairment test of goodwill and recognized a non cash  pre tax impairment of goodwill of million in the quarter ended march  for the fiscal year  the total non cash  pre tax impairment of goodwill and accompanying charge to earnings was million 
the litigation charge for fiscal relates to jury rendered verdicts for compensatory and punitive damages against the company due to a lawsuit involving an isolated dispute between the company and the former employer of an existing sales employee 
as a result of these verdicts  a pre tax litigation charge of million has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the judge may also award the plaintiff their attorney fees and costs 
we intend to continue our defense of this matter and appeal the judgment  as well as pursue potential insurance reimbursement  which has previously been denied

other income for fiscal decreased million to million from million in fiscal other income primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains resulting from certain transactions of our canadian and czech republic subsidiaries that are denominated in us dollars
