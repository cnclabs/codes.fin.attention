table of contents marketing and business development our principal customers are federal  state and local government agencies responsible for adult and juvenile corrections  treatment and educational services 
we manage our business development efforts to address opportunities available in all of our divisions and potential markets 
while such opportunities necessarily include forming relationships with new customers  we also believe that further potential lies in the management of our existing relationships through improved bed management including both utilization and customer mix and through enhancements of our contract terms 
from time to time  we will also evaluate opportunities for accretive acquisition 
in most instances  we pursue development opportunities through requests for proposal rfps or requests for qualifications rfqs  which are submitted in response to government agencies solicitations for bids 
the decision to respond to such solicitations is based upon several factors  including management s assessment of customer needs  our ability to service the needs in an operationally successful and acceptably profitable manner  and the fit of the potential program within our existing portfolio and strategic objectives 
the solicitations generally require the bidder to demonstrate relevant operational experience 
furthermore  the response must also include descriptions of the services to be provided by the bidder and the price at which the bidder is willing to provide them 
services can include not only direct care  but also the design  construction  or renovation of the related facility 
if we believe a project described in an rfp is consistent with our strategic business plan  we will submit a proposal to the requesting agency 
when responding to rfps  we typically incur costs ranging from  to  per proposal 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs to acquire options to lease or purchase land for a proposed facility or to lease or purchase an existing building to house a program 
the preparation of a response usually requires four to weeks 
the award process usually takes an additional three to nine months 
if new construction is required by the contract  the selected company s operation of the facility generally begins between nine and months following award announcement  although in some cases as early as four months 
in instances where construction is required  our success depends  in part  upon our ability to acquire property that is not only satisfactory for programmatic needs but also that lies in a community where social opposition does not significantly impede our ability to operate 
we may incur significant expenses in responding to such opposition  and our response may not be successful 
in addition  we may choose not to respond to an rfp or may withdraw a submitted proposal if significant legal action or other forms of opposition are anticipated or encountered 
in addition to responding to rfps  we also rely upon court referrals  insurance or managed care referrals  and self referrals for business growth  particularly in our juvenile and adult community based treatment programs 
in such instances  court and community liaisons play a significant role in developing our growing network of clients 
contracts our facility operating contracts generally provide that we will be compensated via an occupant per diem rate  fees for treatment services  guaranteed take or pay terms  a fixed fee  or cost plus reimbursement 
factors we consider in determining billing rates include the specified programs provided for by the contract and the related staffing levels  wage levels customary in the respective geographic area  whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased  and the anticipated average occupancy levels that we believe could reasonably be maintained and the ramp up schedule required to reach stable populations 
compensation is invoiced in accordance with the applicable contract and is typically paid on a monthly basis 
some of our juvenile education contracts provide for annual payments 
we pursue new contracts that leverage our existing infrastructure and capabilities 
a significant portion of our opportunities are contracts producing revenue that varies with the number of individuals housed or served  the types of services provided and or the frequency of the service 
the balance of our contracts are take or pay contracts  which provide a fixed minimum revenue stream regardless of occupancy 
competition because our services encompass several diverse markets  we view our competition within these separate markets 
we believe our principal non governmental competitors in the adult secure market are corrections corporation of america  inc  the geo group  inc  and management and training corporation 
within our two other segments abraxas youth and family services and adult community based services we typically encounter a significantly more fragmented competitor base  which includes not only for profit operators like ourselves but also not for profit organizations 
within the abraxas youth and family services division  some of our primary non governmental competitors include viaquest  youth and family centered services  securicor new century and ramsay youth services 
our larger non governmental competitors in the adult community based market include dismas house  bannum  gateway  salvation army and volunteers of america 

table of contents employees at december   we had  full time employees and part time employees 
we employ management  administrative and clerical  security  educational and counseling services  health services and general maintenance personnel 
approximately employees at four of our facilities are represented by labor unions 
regulations the industry in which we operate is subject to federal  state and local regulations administered by a variety of regulatory authorities 
generally  prospective providers of correctional  detention  educational  treatment and community based services must comply with a variety of applicable federal  state and local regulations  including correctional  education  healthcare  environmental and safety regulations 
our contracts frequently include extensive reporting requirements  including mandatory supervision with on site monitoring by representatives of our contracting government agencies  as well as audits by these and other governmental departments 
in addition to regulations requiring certain contracting government agencies to enter into a competitive bidding procedure before awarding contracts  the laws of certain jurisdictions may also require us to award subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract with businesses owned by women or members of minority groups 
business concentration for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues were derived from multiple contracts with the bop 
no other single customer makes up greater than of our consolidated revenues for these years 
insurance we maintain general liability insurance for all of our operations at an amount equal to million per occurrence per facility and in the aggregate 
we also maintain insurance in amounts management deems adequate to cover property and casualty risks  workers compensation  and directors and officers liability 
our contracts and the statutes of certain states in which we operate typically require us to maintain insurance 
our contracts provide that  in the event we do not maintain such insurance  the contracting agency may terminate its agreement with us 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these requirements 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations  and these laws can impose strict liability for the discharge of hazardous or toxic substances 
as an owner and operator of facilities  we are subject to these laws and could be responsible for the discharge of contaminants at our facilities 
we are not currently incurring material costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation  although in the event we had an environmental issue at any of our current or previously owned facilities  the cost of complying with these environmental laws could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
risk factors our significant level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
our total consolidated indebtedness as of december  was approximately million 
our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance  which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain other financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal  premium  if any  and interest and additional interest  if any  on our indebtedness 
we may need to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
however  we may not be able to complete these alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
additionally  a significant portion of our assets is owned  and a significant percentage of our revenue is generated  by our subsidiaries 
our cash flows and our ability to repay our indebtedness depends upon the performance of these subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
certain of our borrowings  including any borrowings under our amended credit facility  will be at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  and our net income would decrease 
the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the economy may negatively impact our ability to access financing  revenues and earnings 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than twelve months 
since the third quarter of and continuing through the first quarter of  the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels 
the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for many issuers  including us 
while we intend to finance our operations with existing cash  cash flow from operations and borrowing under our amended credit facility  we may require additional financing to support our continued growth 
however  due to the existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets  access to capital  including capital through the accordion feature of our amended credit facility  on terms acceptable to us may be limited or unavailable 
several large financial institutions have either recently failed or been dependent on the assistance of the federal government to continue to operate as a going concern 
we can provide no assurance that all of the banks that have made commitments to us under our revolving credit facility will continue to operate as a going concern in the future or that such banks would be willing to participate in an expansion to the amended credit facility in the event the company desires to exercise the accordion feature of the amended credit facility 
if any of the banks in the lending group were to fail or decline to participate in the expansion of the credit facility under the accordion feature  it is possible that the capacity under the revolving credit facility would not be expanded by the full amount that might be requested by us under the accordion feature and might even be reduced to below the existing committed availability 
in the event that we could not obtain an increased commitment by virtue of the accordion feature of the amended credit facility  we could be required to obtain capital from alternate sources in order to continue our growth through future development and expansion initiatives 
our options for addressing such capital constraints would include  but not be limited to i obtaining commitments from the remaining banks in the lending group or from new banks to fund increased amounts under the terms of the amended credit facility  or its accordion feature  ii accessing the public capital markets  or iii delaying certain of the company s planned expansion projects 
such alternatives in the current market would likely be on terms less favorable than under existing terms  which could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the restrictive covenants in our senior notes and amended credit facility may affect our ability to operate our business successfully 
the indenture governing our senior notes and our amended credit facility contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions 
these covenants limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  pay dividends or other distributions  make certain types of investments  incur liens  restrict distributions from our subsidiaries  enter into transactions with affiliates  and consolidate or merge with or into  or sell substantially all of our assets to  another 
in addition  our amended credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
any failure to comply with the restrictions of our amended credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes or any other subsequent financing agreements may result in an event of default 
an event of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
furthermore  we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our amended credit facility 
if we default on the financial covenants in our amended credit facility  our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
despite current indebtedness levels  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt 
this could further exacerbate the risks described above 
the terms of the indenture governing our senior notes and our amended credit facility restrict our ability to incur but do not prohibit us from incurring significant additional indebtedness in the future 
we have several ongoing expansion projects underway and anticipate commencing other projects  and we will likely need to finance these future outlays of capital since our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to fully fund all of these potential expenditures 
depending on market conditions and other factors  we will consider additional debt financing to fund these outlays of capital as well as to refinance a portion of our existing indebtedness 
if new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 
we are dependent on government appropriations  which may not be made on a timely basis or at all and may be adversely impacted by budgetary constraints at the federal  state and local levels 
our cash flow is subject to the receipt of sufficient funding of and timely payment by contracting governmental entities 
if the appropriate governmental agency does not receive sufficient appropriations to cover its contractual obligations  a contract may be terminated or the amounts payable to us may be deferred or reduced 
also  we are dependent upon funding for anticipated future contracts  including those for certain facility expansions and new construction projects that we have undertaken  such as those at d 
ray james and hudson  colorado 
federal  state  county and local governments have encountered  and are expected to continue to encounter  significant budgetary constraints that may result in a reduction of spending on the outsourced services that we provide 
such budgetary limitations may cause the contractual commitments to be reduced or even eliminated  which would make it unprofitable to continue operating a certain facility and require us to find alternate customers or close such facility 
any delays in payment  or the termination of a contract  could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial condition  which may make it difficult to satisfy our payment obligations on our indebtedness  including the amended credit facility  in a timely manner 
in addition  as a result of  among other things  recent economic developments  federal  state and local governments have encountered  and may continue to encounter  unusual budgetary constraints 
as a result  a number of state and local governments are under pressure to control additional spending or reduce current levels of spending which could limit or eliminate appropriations for the facilities that we operate 
additionally  as a result of these factors  we may be requested in the future to reduce our existing per diem contract rates or forego prospective increases to those rates 
budgetary limitations may also make it more difficult for us to renew our existing contracts on favorable terms or at all 
further  a number of states in which we operate are experiencing significant budget deficits for fiscal year we cannot assure that these deficits will not result in reductions in per diems  delays in payment for services rendered or unilateral termination of contracts 
recently  the state of california has notified vendors providing services to the state that it might have to temporarily issue iou s 
we have not received notice that our services will be subject to such iou s and our outstanding receivables related to california are consistent with normal payment practices for the state 
as a result of this increased budgetary pressure  in certain cases we have granted a few of our customers relief from formulaic increase provisions in their agreements and some of our customers have not included in their appropriation legislation amounts that would increase the per diem rates payable to us or have otherwise attempted to reduce the contract value 
contractual rate increases are generally intended to offset increases in expenses and inflation 
to the extent rates are not increased or are reduced  our profitability will be adversely affected 
examples of this budget pressure include the need of the federal government to operate under a continuing resolution as a result of its failure to pass a new year budget and reported budget pressures in most states including alaska  arizona  california  colorado  georgia  illinois  pennsylvania and texas 
we are subject to the short term nature of government contracts 
many governmental agencies are legally limited in their ability to enter into fixed long term contracts that would bind elected officials responsible for future budgets 
therefore  many contracts with government agencies  including the bop  typically either have a very short term or  even when for a longer term  are subject to termination on short notice without cause 
the majority of our contracts have primary terms of one to three years 
our contracts with governmental agencies may contain one or more renewal options that may be exercised only by the contracting governmental agency 
some of these contracts may not be renewed by the governmental agency and no assurance can be given that the governmental agency will exercise a renewal option in the future 
in addition  the governmental agency may elect to solicit bids pursuant to a rfp or rfq rather than exercise a renewal option 
we may not be successful in responding to a rfp or rfq 
the non renewal or termination of any of our significant contracts with governmental agencies  our inability to secure new facility management contracts from others or our failure to successfully respond to a rfp or rfq could materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operation and liquidity 
to the extent we have made significant capital expenditures and have short term contracts with our customers that are not renewed or extended  we may not recover our entire capital investment 
our ability to win new contracts to develop and manage correctional  detention and treatment facilities depends on many factors outside our control 
our growth is generally dependent upon our ability to win new contracts to develop and manage new or expanded correctional  detention and treatment facilities 
this depends on a number of factors we cannot control  including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  the demand for our facilities could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts  leniency in conviction and sentencing practices or through the legal decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws 
for instance  changes in laws relating to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could reduce the number of persons arrested  convicted and sentenced  thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them and community based services to transition offenders back into the community 
similarly  reductions in crime rates could lead to reductions in arrests  convictions and sentences requiring correctional facilities 
when seeking bids  most governmental entities evaluate the financial strength of the bidders 
to the extent they believe we do not have sufficient financial resources  we will be unable to effectively compete for bids 
additionally  our success in obtaining new awards and contracts may depend  in part  upon our ability to locate land that can be leased or acquired on favorable terms 
furthermore  desirable locations may be in or near populated areas and  therefore  may generate legal action or other forms of opposition from residents in areas surrounding a proposed site 
our profitability may suffer if the number of offenders occupying our correctional  detention and treatment facilities decreases or there is a shift in occupancy among our divisions 
our correctional  detention and treatment facilities are dependent upon governmental agencies supplying offenders and we do not control occupancy levels at our facilities 
we believe the rate of growth experienced in the adult secure sector during the late s and early s is stabilizing 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated under contracts that specify a net rate per day per resident  or a per diem rate  sometimes with no minimum guaranteed occupancy levels  even though most correctional facility cost structures are relatively fixed 
under such a per diem rate structure  a decrease in occupancy levels at a particular facility could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations at such facility 
a decrease in the occupancy of certain juvenile justice  education and treatment facilities would have a more significant impact on our operating results than a decrease in occupancy in the adult secure division due to higher per diem revenue at certain juvenile facilities 
certain social commentators and various political or governmental representatives suggest that community based corrections of adults may be emphasized in the future as alternatives to traditional incarceration 
we have historically experienced higher operating margins in the adult secure and the adult community based sectors than in the juvenile services sector 
a shift in occupancy among our segments of business operations could result in a decrease in our profitability 
a failure to comply with existing regulations could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of our contracts 
our industry is subject to a variety of federal  state  county and local regulations  including education  environmental  health care and safety regulations  which are administered by various regulatory authorities 
we may not always successfully comply with these regulations  and failure to comply could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of facility management contracts 
the contracts typically include extensive reporting requirements and supervision and on site monitoring by representatives of contracting governmental agencies 
corrections officers are customarily required to meet certain training standards  and in some instances facility personnel are required to be licensed and subject to background investigation 
certain jurisdictions also require that subcontracts be awarded on a competitive basis or that we subcontract with businesses owned by members of minority groups 
the failure to comply with any applicable laws  rules or regulations and the loss of any required license could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations at our affected facilities 
governmental agencies may investigate and audit our contracts and  if any improprieties are found  we may be required to refund revenues we have received  and or to forego anticipated revenues and may be subject to penalties and sanctions  including prohibitions on our bidding in response to rfps 
governmental agencies we contract with have the authority to audit and investigate our contracts with them 
as part of that process  some governmental agencies review our performance on the contract  our pricing practices  our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if the agency determines that we have improperly allocated costs to a specific contract  we may not be reimbursed for those costs and we could be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been reimbursed 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities by us or we otherwise determine that these activities have occurred  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government 
any adverse determination could adversely impact our ability to bid in response to rfps in one or more jurisdictions and significantly reduce the probability of our success in the bid process for future contracts 
if we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations  our ability to compete for future contracts and our financial condition may be adversely affected 
our failure to comply with contract requirements or to meet our client s performance expectations when performing a contract could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation  which  in turn  would impact our ability to compete for new contracts 
our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages 
in addition  our contracts often require us to indemnify clients for our failure to meet performance standards 
some of our contracts contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures 
although we have liability insurance  the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities 
competitors in our industry may adversely affect the profitability of our business 
we must compete with government entities and other private operators on the basis of cost  quality and range of services offered  experience in managing facilities  reputation of personnel and ability to design  finance and construct new facilities on a cost effective competitive basis 
while there are some barriers for companies seeking to enter into the management and operation of correctional  detention and treatment facilities  these barriers have not been sufficient to materially limit additional competition 
certain areas of our operation may not pose a significant barrier to entry into the market by private operators 
for example  private operators may not find it as difficult to bid for juvenile treatment  educational and detention services and pre release correctional and treatment services as they do adult correctional and detention services 
further  our government customers may assume the management of a facility currently managed by us upon the termination of the corresponding management contract or  if such customers have capacity at their facilities  may take inmates currently housed in our facilities and transfer them to government run facilities 
the resulting decrease in occupancy levels would reduce our revenue due to the per diem rate structure and could result in a significant decrease in the profitability of our business 
a disturbance or violent occurrence in one of our facilities could result in closure of a facility or harm to our business 
an escape  riot  disturbance or violent occurrence at one of our facilities could adversely affect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of our operations 
among other things  the negative publicity generated as a result of an event could adversely affect our ability to retain an existing contract or obtain future ones 
in addition  if such an event were to occur  there is a possibility that the facility where the event occurred may be shut down by the relevant governmental agency 
a closure of certain of our facilities could adversely affect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of our operations 
such negative events including an occurrence at a competitor s facility may also result in a significant increase in our liability insurance costs 
negative media coverage  including inaccurate or misleading information  could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to bid for government contracts 
the media frequently focuses its attention on private operators contracts with governmental agencies 
if the media coverage of private operators is negative  it could influence government officials to slow the pace of outsourcing government services  which could reduce the number of rfps 
the media may also focus its attention on the activities of political consultants engaged by us  even when their activities are unrelated to our business  and we may be tainted by adverse media coverage about their activities 
moreover  inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and  accordingly  our ability to bid for and win government contracts 
we often incur significant costs before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls and a risk of not recovering our investment 
when we are awarded a contract to manage a new facility  we may incur significant expenses before we receive contract payments 
these expenses include purchasing real estate  constructing new facilities  leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring and training personnel 
as a result  when the government does not fund a facility s pre opening and start up costs  we may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments 
in addition  payments due to us from governmental agencies may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures by our governmental customers to attain necessary budget approvals and finalize contracts in a timely manner 
several juvenile services contracts related to educational services provide for annual collection several months after a school year is completed 
in addition  a contract may be terminated prior to its scheduled expiration and as a result we may not recover these expenses or realize any return on our investment 
we may choose to undertake development projects without written commitments to make use of such facilities 
we may not be able to obtain contracts for these facilities in a timely fashion  if at all 
to the extent we do not obtain contracts  we could be unable to recover our investment and our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we may be unable to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel necessary to sustain our business 
our delivery of services is labor intensive 
when we are awarded a contract  we must hire operating management  security  case management and other personnel 
the success of our business requires that we attract  develop  motivate and retain these personnel 
our ability to recruit and retain qualified individuals varies by facility and is related to the socio economic factors in the particular community in which the facility operates 
the department of labor wages we offer our employees are often higher than wages they could obtain elsewhere in the community 
however  if the local economy where a facility is located is robust and unemployment is low  we may have difficulty hiring and retaining qualified personnel 
in addition  there are inherent risks associated with the nature of the services we provide  which could cause certain qualified individuals to seek other employment opportunities 
we have typically experienced high turnover of personnel in our juvenile and adult secure facilities within the first year of their employment 
our inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of personnel could adversely affect our business 
if we do not successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may be unable to manage businesses that we may acquire profitably or integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses  delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations 
acquisitions generally require the integration of facilities  some of which may be located in states in which we do not currently have operations 
moreover  business combinations involve additional risks  including diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel  assumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities  our becoming significantly leveraged as a result of the incurrence of debt to finance an acquisition  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities  amortization or possible impairment charges of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  and dilution to our earnings per share 
also  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business could materially and adversely affect our reputation as a whole 
further  the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings we anticipated 
because environmental laws impose strict  as well as joint and several  liability for clean up costs  unforeseen environmental risks could prove to be costly 
our facilities  and any facilities that we may acquire in the future  may be subject to unforeseen environmental risks 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla imposes strict  as well as joint and several  liability for certain environmental cleanup costs on several classes of potentially responsible parties  including current owners and operators of the property 
other federal and state laws in certain circumstances may impose liability for environmental remediation  which costs may be substantial 
further  the operation of our facilities  and the development of new facilities  requires that we obtain  and comply with  permits and other authorizations under environmental laws 
obtaining such permits and authorizations may affect our existing facilities or could delay the opening of new facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have in the past incurred  and may continue to incur  significant expenses for facilities that we no longer operate 
if we close a facility  we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease  which would include  among other things  payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term 
we may also be required to incur other expenses with respect to such facilities 
the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open underperforming facilities 
as a result  ongoing lease operations at closed or under performing facilities could impair our results of operations 
we may continue to operate under unprofitable contracts at facilities that we own to offset expenses associated with ownership of the facility 
if our operations are unprofitable at a leased facility or if the leased facility is performing significantly below targeted levels  we would typically terminate the contract and the lease 
however  we may continue to operate our contract at an owned facility to offset the expenses associated with ownership 
continued performance of such a contract could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we depend on a limited number of governmental customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
we currently derive  and expect to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from the bop and various state agencies 
the loss of  or a significant decrease in  business from the bop or those state agencies could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our bop contracts accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  million  of our total revenues for the year ended december  million and of our total revenues for the year ended december  million 
we expect to continue to depend upon the bop and a relatively small group of other governmental customers for a significant percentage of our revenues 
because our revenues can fluctuate from period to period  we may face short term funding shortfalls from time to time 
revenues can fluctuate from year to year due to changes in government funding policies  changes in the number of clients referred to our facilities by governmental agencies  the opening of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities and the termination of contracts for a facility or the closure of a facility 
our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter  based on the number of contracted days in each quarter 
because our revenues can vary  we may face short term funding shortfalls from time to time 
in addition  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
resistance to privatization of correctional and detention facilities could result in our inability to obtain new contracts or the loss of existing contracts 
management of correctional and detention facilities  particularly of adult secure facilities  by private entities has not achieved complete acceptance by either the government or the public 
the movement toward privatization of correctional and detention facilities has also encountered resistance from certain groups  such as labor unions  local sheriff s departments  religious organizations and groups believing that correctional and detention facility operations should only be conducted by government agencies 
changes in the dominant political party in any market in which correctional facilities are located could have an adverse impact on privatization 
furthermore  some government agencies are not legally permitted to delegate their traditional management responsibilities for correctional and detention facilities to private companies 
in addition  as a private prison manager  we are subject to government legislation and regulation restricting the ability of private prison managers to house certain types of inmates  such as inmates from other jurisdictions or inmates at medium or higher security levels 
legislation has been enacted in several states  and has previously been proposed in the united states house of representatives  containing such restrictions 
any such legislation may have a material adverse affect on us 
any of these resistances may make it more difficult for us to renew or maintain existing contracts  to obtain new contracts or sites on which to operate new facilities or to develop or purchase facilities and lease them to government or private entities  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to significant insurance costs 
worker s compensation  employee health and general liability insurance represent significant costs to us 
we may continue to incur increasing insurance costs  typically due to adverse claims experience or rising healthcare costs in general 
due to concerns over corporate governance and recent corporate accounting scandals  liability and other types of insurance have become more difficult and costly to obtain 
in addition  stockholder lawsuits will generally serve to increase our directors and officers liability insurance 
unanticipated additional insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows  and the failure to obtain or maintain any necessary insurance coverage or the inability of an insurance carrier to perform under its obligations through issued coverage could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to risks associated with ownership of real estate and related operation of our facilities 
our ownership of correctional and detention facilities subjects us to risks typically associated with investments in real estate 
moreover  correctional and detention facilities are relatively illiquid and therefore  our ability to divest ourselves of one or more of our facilities promptly in response to changed conditions is limited 
investments in correctional and detention facilities subject us to risks involving potential exposure to uninsured loss 
our operating costs may be affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing laws  ordinances and regulations  as well as the cost of complying with future legislation 
our facilities are also subject to hazards such as fire  hurricanes  earthquakes and other natural disasters 
for example  hurricane ike that came ashore in texas in september damaged our beaumont transitional treatment center  leidel comprehensive sanction center and reid community residential facility 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant events 
in addition  although we maintain insurance for many types of losses  there are certain types of losses  such as losses from earthquakes  riots and acts of terrorism  which may be either uninsurable or for which it may not be economically feasible to obtain insurance coverage 
as a result  we could lose both our capital invested in  and anticipated profits from  one or more of the facilities we own 
further  we could experience losses that may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage 
we may be adversely affected by inflation 
many of our facility management contracts provide for fixed management fees or fees that increase by only small amounts during their term 
if  due to inflation or other causes  our operating expenses  such as wages and salaries of our employees  and insurance  medical and food costs  increase at rates faster than increases  if any  in our management fees  then our profitability would be adversely affected

while management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  overall trends in results of operations or cash flows  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or equitable relief  and could have a material adverse impact on the net income of the period in which the ruling occurs 
valencia county detention center in april  a lawsuit was filed against the company in the federal district court in albuquerque  new mexico  by joe torres and eufrasio armijo  who each alleged that he was strip searched at the valencia county detention center vcdc in new mexico in violation of his federal rights under the fourth  fourteenth and eighth amendments to the us constitution 
the claimants also alleged violation of their rights under state law and sought to bring the case as a class action on behalf of themselves and all detainees at vcdc during the applicable statutes of limitation 
the plaintiffs sought damages and declaratory and injunctive relief 
valencia county is also a named defendant in the case and operated the vcdc for a significantly greater portion of the period covered by the lawsuit 
in december  the parties agreed to a proposed stipulation of settlement and the court has preliminarily approved the settlement 
the settlement amount under the terms of the agreement is million 
cornell s portion of the stipulated settlement  based on the number of inmates housed at vcdc during the time cornell operated the facility in comparison to the number of inmates housed at the facility during the time valencia county operated the facility  is million and was funded principally through our general liability and professional liability coverage 
in the year ended december   we previously provided insurance reserves for this matter as part of our regular review of reported and unreported claims totaling approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional settlement charge of approximately million and the related reimbursement from our general liability and professional liability insurance 
the charge and reimbursement were recognized in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  the reimbursement was funded by the insurance carrier in the first quarter of into a settlement account  where it will remain until payments are made to the settlement class members 
the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement in the first quarter of  and the claims administration process is underway 
we expect the claims administration process to be completed and the final court approval of the settlement in the fourth quarter of shareholder lawsuits on october   a purported class action complaint was filed in the district court of harris county  texas  th judicial district no 
by ted kinbergy  an alleged stockholder of cornell 
the complaint names as defendants cornell and each member of the board of directors at the time of the suit  as well as veritas capital fund iii  lp veritas 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that i the defendants have breached fiduciary duties they assertedly owed to our stockholders in connection with our entering into the agreement and plan of merger  dated as of october   with veritas  cornell holding corp  and cci acquisition corp  and ii the merger consideration is unfair and inadequate 
the plaintiffs sought  among other things  an injunction against the consummation of the merger 
the proposed merger was rejected at a special meeting of our stockholders held on january  consequently  we believe the case is moot and expect the plaintiffs to seek dismissal of their claims accompanied by a request for legal fees that may be owed 
we do not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents other we hold insurance policies to cover potential director and officer liability  some of which may limit our cash outflows in the event of a decision adverse to us in the matters discussed above

although we believe we will continue to see steady demand across our various business segments and our customer base federal  state and local in  we are monitoring the declining economic trends and related government budget plans and the effect tightened spending plans could have on our business 
we expect a key driver for our performance in to be our ability to manage our various facility expansions currently in process and bring them on line 
we also plan to remain focused on our operating margins  on increasing utilization particularly in the abraxas division and improving customer mix as we believe those initiatives are key elements of our financial performance 
management overview demand 
our business is driven generally by demand for incarceration or treatment services  and specifically by demand for private incarceration or treatment services  within our three primary business segments adult secure services  abraxas youth and family services  and adult community based services 
the demand for adult and juvenile corrections and treatment services has generally increased at a steady rate over the past ten years  largely as a result of increasing sentence terms and or mandatory sentences for criminals and as well a greater range of criminal acts  increasing demand for incarceration of illegal aliens and a public recognition of the need to provide services to juveniles that will improve the possibility that they will lead productive lives 
moreover  demand for our services is also affected by the amount of available capacity in the government systems to enable governments to provide the services themselves  as well as desire and ability of these systems to add additional capacity 
in addition  the balance between community based corrections treatment of adults as an alternative to traditional incarceration continues to be analyzed by many political and societal parties 
among other things  we monitor federal  state and industry communications and statistics relative to trends in prison populations  juvenile justice statistics and initiatives  and developments in alternatives to traditional incarceration or detention of adults for opportunities to expand our scope or delivery of services 
the federal government contracts with private providers for the incarceration of adults  whether they are serving prison sentences  detained as illegal aliens  detained in anticipation of pending judicial administration or transitioning from prison to society 
chief among the federal agencies which use private providers are the bop  us immigration and customs enforcement ice and usms 
we provide adult secure and adult community based services to the federal government 
most of the federal involvement in juvenile administration in the federal system is handled via medicare and medicaid assistance to state governments 
although there are circumstances in which we may contract with a federal agency on a sole source basis  the primary means by which we secure a contract with a federal agency is via the rfp bidding process 
from time to time  we contract to provide management services to a local governmental unit who then bids on a federal contract 
states and smaller governmental units remain divided on the issue of private prisons and private provision of juvenile and community based programs  although a majority of states permit private provision for our services 
we anticipate that increasing budget pressure on states and smaller governmental units may cause more states and smaller governmental units to consider utilizing private providers such as us to provide these services on a more economical basis 
we believe capital budget constraints among prison agencies may encourage them to continue to explore outsourcing to private operators as an alternative to deploying their own capital for prison construction or major refurbishment 
although it varies from governmental unit to governmental unit  the primary political forces who typically oppose privatization of prisons are organized labor and religious groups 
private juvenile and community based programs are utilized by states and local governmental units and are organized on a profit and not for profit basis 
we monitor opportunities in these segments via our corporate and business division development officials 
many opportunities are not published in any manner and  accordingly  we believe that taking the initiative at the state and local levels is key in developing sole source opportunities 
performance 
we track a number of factors as we monitor financial performance 
chief among them are capacity the number of beds within each business segment s facilities  occupancy utilization  per diem reimbursement rates  revenues  operating margins  and operating expenses 

table of contents capacity 
capacity  commonly expressed in terms of number of beds  is primarily impacted by the number and size of the facilities we own or lease and the facilities we operate on behalf of a third party owner or lessee 
we view capacity as one of the measures of our development efforts  through which we may increase capacity by adding new projects or by expanding existing projects as we have done in and at several of our facilities including great plains correctional facility and d 
ray james prison 
as part of the evaluation of our development efforts  we will assess a whether a given development project was brought into service in accordance with our expectation as to time and expense  and b the number of projects in development or under consideration at the relevant point in time 
in addition to the focus on new projects  capacity will reflect our success in renewing and maintaining existing contracts and facilities 
it will also reflect any closure of programs or facilities due to underutilization or failure to earn an adequate risk adjusted rate of return 
we must also be cognizant of the possibility that state or local budgetary limitations may cause the contractual commitment to a given facility to be reduced or even eliminated  which would require us to either secure an alternate customer or close the operation 
occupancy 
occupancy is typically expressed in terms of percentage of contract capacity utilized 
we look at occupancy to assess the efficacy of both our efforts to market our facilities and our efforts to retain existing customers or contracts 
because revenue varies directly with occupancy  occupancy is a driver of our revenues 
our industry experiences significant economics of scale  whereby as occupancy rises  operating costs per resident decline 
some of our contracts are take or pay  meaning that the agency making use of the facility is obligated to pay for beds even though they are not used 
historically  occupancy percentages in many of our facilities have been high and we are mindful of the need to maintain such occupancy levels 
as new development projects are brought into service  occupancy percentages may decline until the projects reach full utilization as  for example  with the activation of the  bed expansion at great plains correctional facility during the fourth quarter of 
where we have commitments for utilization before the commencement of operations  occupancy percentages reflect the speed at which a facility achieves full service implementation 
however  we may decide to undertake development projects without written commitments to make full use of a facility 
in these instances  we have performed our own assessment  based on discussions with local government or other potential customer representatives and analysis of other factors  of the demand for services at the facility 
there is no assurance that we would recover our initial investment in these projects 
we will monitor occupancy as a measure of the accuracy of our estimation of the demand for the services of a development facility  and will incorporate this information in future assessments of potential projects 
per diem reimbursement rates 
per diem reimbursement rates are another key element of our gross revenue and operating margin since per diem contracts represent a majority of our revenues for the year ended december  
per diem rates are a function of negotiation between management and a governmental unit at the inception of a contract or through the bidding process 
actual per diem rates vary dramatically across our business segments  and as well as within each business segment depending upon the particular service or program provided 
the initial per diem rates often change during the term of a contract in accordance with a schedule 
the amount of the change can be a fixed amount set forth within the contract  an amount determined by formulas set forth within the contract or an amount determined by negotiations between management and the governmental unit often these negotiations are along the same lines as the original per diem negotiation a review of expenses and approval of an amount to recompense for expenses and assure the potential of an operating profit 
in recent years  as budgetary pressures on governmental units have increased  some of our customers have negotiated relief from formulaic increase provisions within their agreements or have declined to include in their appropriation legislation amounts that would increase the per diem rates payable under the contract 
based on the economic turmoil which began in the second half of  we are expecting such pressures to continue in for many of our customers 
in similar prior situations we have attempted to mitigate the impact of these developments by negotiating services provided  obtaining commitments for increased volume and other measures 
we may also choose to consider terminating an existing relationship at a given facility and replacing it with a new customer as was done with the great plains correctional facility in 
revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from providing adult corrections and treatment and juvenile justice  educational and treatment services outsourced by federal  state and local government agencies in the united states 
revenues for our services are generally recognized on a per diem rate based upon the number of occupant days or hours served for the period  on a guaranteed take or pay basis or on a cost plus reimbursement basis 
for the year ended december   our revenue base consisted of for services provided under per diem contracts  for services provided under take or pay and management contracts  for services provided under cost plus reimbursement contracts  for services provided under fee for service contracts and from other miscellaneous sources 
for the year ended december   our revenue base consisted of for services provided under per diem contracts  for services provided under take or pay and management contracts  for services provided under cost plus reimbursement contracts  for services provided under fee for service contracts and from other miscellaneous sources 
the increase in the percentage of revenues provided under take or pay and management contracts for was due primarily to the take or pay contract 
table of contents awarded by the bop to our big spring correctional center in and the inmate take or pay contract awarded by the arizona department of corrections at our great plains correctional facility under which we began operations in september the increase in the percentage of revenues provided under take or pay contracts was partially offset by the transition of certain of our management contracts including the donald w 
wyatt detention center in july to the facility owner and the termination of our management contract for the harrisburg alternative education school program for the school year due to lack of funding by the contracting agency 
the decrease in the percentage of revenues provided under per diem contracts in as compared to the prior year was due primarily to the transition of the contracts at the great plains correctional facility and the big spring correctional center as previously noted 
this decrease was partially offset by the addition of the high plains correctional facility acquired in may revenues can fluctuate from year to year due to changes in government funding policies  changes in the number or types of clients referred to our facilities by governmental agencies  changes in the types of services delivered to our customers  the opening of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities and the termination of contracts for a facility or the closure of a facility 
factors considered in determining billing rates to charge include the programs specified by the contract and the related staffing levels  wage levels customary in the respective geographic areas  whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased  and the anticipated average occupancy levels that could reasonably be expected to be maintained and the duration of time required to reach such occupancy levels 
revenues adult secure services 
revenues for our adult secure services division are primarily generated from per diem  take or pay and management contracts 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average per diem rates on our adult secure facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease in the rate is due primarily to the increase in occupancy at the moshannon valley correctional center during over the prior year 
this facility operates under a take or pay contract  as a result  the effective average per diem rate will decrease as the population at the facility increases 
the average per diem rate also benefited from the receipt of a contract based revenue adjustment for the contract year ended march in the amount of million at the rcc 
we periodically have experienced pressure from contracting governmental agencies to limit or even reduce per diem rates 
many of these governmental entities are under severe budget pressures and we anticipate that governmental agencies may periodically approach us about per diem rate concessions or decline to provide funding for contractual rate increases 
decreases in  or the lack of anticipated increases in  per diem rates could adversely impact our operating margin 
revenues abraxas youth and family services 
revenues for our abraxas youth and family services division are primarily generated from per diem  fee for service and cost plus reimbursement contracts 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average per diem rates on our residential youth and family services facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in the average per diem rate for reflects the continued ramp up of the cornell abraxas academy reactivated in the fourth quarter of  the reactivation of the hector garza residential treatment center in august as well as changes in the mix of services provided and customers served at other facilities 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average fee for service rates for our non residential community based abraxas youth and family services facilities and programs  including rates that are limited by medicaid and other private insurance providers  of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in the average fee for service rates for and is due to changes in the mix of services provided at our non residential facilities 
the majority of our abraxas youth and family services contracts renew annually 
revenues adult community based services 
revenues for our adult community based services division are primarily generated from per diem and fee for service contracts 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average per diem rates on our residential adult community based facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average fee for service rates on our non residential adult community based services facilities and programs of approximately  and  respectively 
our average fee for service rates fluctuate from year to year principally due to changes in the mix of services provided by our various adult community based services programs and facilities 
operating margins 
we have historically experienced higher operating margins in our adult secure services and adult community based services divisions as compared to our abraxas youth and family services division 
our operating margin  in a given period  will be impacted by those facilities which may either be dormant or have been reactivated during the period 
as previously discussed  we have reactivated several facilities  including the cornell abraxas academy and the hector garza residential treatment center in and  respectively 
we have also expanded several of our adult secure facilities d 
ray james prison  great plains correctional facility and walnut grove youth correctional facility  for example  which provides the opportunity to leverage existing infrastructure 
additionally  our operating margins within a 
table of contents division can vary from facility to facility based on whether a facility is owned or leased  the level of competition for the contract award  the proposed length of the contract  the mix of services provided  the occupancy levels for a facility  the level of capital commitment required with respect to a facility  the anticipated changes in operating costs over the term of the contract and our ability to increase a facility s contract revenue 
under take or pay contracts  such as the contract at the moshannon valley correctional center  operating margins are typically higher during the early stages of the contract as the facility s population ramps up as revenues are received at contract percentages regardless of actual occupancy 
as the variable costs primarily resident related and certain facility costs increase with the growth in population  operating margins will generally decline to a stabilized level 
following its activation in april  we experienced such operating margin impact pertaining to the moshannon valley correctional center in the third and fourth quarters of a decline in occupancy at our abraxas youth and family services facilities can have a more significant impact on operating margins than our adult secure services division due to the longer periods typically required to ramp resident population at a youth facility 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience interim period operating margin fluctuations due to factors such as the number of calendar days in the period  higher payroll taxes generally in the first half of the year and salary and wage increases and insurance cost increases that are incurred prior to certain contract rate increases 
periodically  many of the governmental agencies with whom we contract may experience budgetary pressures and may approach us to limit or reduce per diem rates including contractual price increases as well 
we anticipate such customer behavior in decreases in  or the lack of anticipated increases in  per diem rates could adversely impact our operating margin 
additionally  a decrease in per diem rates without a corresponding decrease in operating expenses could also adversely impact our operating margin 
operating expenses 
we track several different areas of our operating expenses 
foremost among these expenses are employee compensation and benefits and expenses  risk related areas such as general liability  medical and worker s compensation  client inmate costs such as food  clothing  medical and programming costs  financing costs and administrative overhead expenses 
increases or decreases in one or more of these expenses  such as our experience with rising insurance costs  can have a material effect on our financial performance 
operating expenses are also impacted by decisions to close or terminate a particular program or facility 
such decisions are based on our assessments of operating results  operating efficiency and risk adjusted returns and are an ongoing part of our portfolio management 
in addition  decisions to restructure employee positions will typically increase period costs initially at the time of such actions  but generally reduce post restructuring expense levels 
we are responsible for all facility operating costs  except for certain debt service and interest or lease payments for facilities where we have a management contract only 
at these facilities  the facility owner is responsible for all debt service and interest or lease payments related to the facility 
we are responsible for all other operating expenses at these facilities 
we operated facilities under management contracts at december   facilities at december  and facilities at december  included in the facilities under management contracts at december  were the walnut grove youth correctional facility and the eight los angeles county jails  which represented  beds of service capacity  or approximately of the residential service capacity represented by management contracts 
a majority of our facility operating costs consists of fixed costs 
these fixed costs include lease and rental expense  insurance  utilities and depreciation 
as a result  when we commence operation of new or expanded facilities  fixed operating costs may increase 
the amount of our variable operating costs  including food  medical services  supplies and clothing  depend on occupancy levels at the facilities 
our largest single operating cost  facility payroll expense and related employment taxes and expenses  has both a fixed and a variable component 
we can adjust a facility s staffing levels and the related payroll expense to a certain extent based on occupancy at a facility  however a minimum fixed number of employees is required to operate and maintain any facility regardless of occupancy levels 
personnel costs are subject to increases in tightening labor markets based on local economic environments and other conditions 
we incur pre opening and start up expenses including payroll  benefits  training and other operating costs prior to opening a new or expanded facility and during the period of operation while occupancy is ramping up 
these costs vary by contract and the pace scale of the activation and related population ramp 
since pre opening and start up costs are generally factored into the revenue per diem rate that is charged to the contracting agency  we typically expect to recover these upfront costs over the life of the contract 
because occupancy rates during a facility s start up phase typically result in capacity under utilization for at least to days  we may incur additional post opening start up costs 
we do not anticipate post opening start up costs at any adult secure facilities operated under any future contracts with the bop which are take or pay contracts  meaning that the bop will pay at least of the contractual monthly revenue once the facility opens  regardless of actual occupancy 
newly opened facilities are staffed according to applicable regulatory or contractual requirements when we begin receiving offenders or clients 
offenders or clients are typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a phased in basis over a one to six month period 
our start up period for new juvenile operations is months from the date we begin recognizing revenue unless break even occupancy levels are achieved before then 
the actual time required to ramp a juvenile facility with approximate capacity of to beds may be a period of one to three years 
our start up period for new adult operations is nine months from the date we begin recognizing revenue unless break even occupancy levels are achieved before then 
the approximate time to ramp an adult facility of approximately  beds may be a period of three to six months  depending upon the customer requirements 
although 
table of contents we typically recover these upfront costs over the life of the contract  quarterly results can be substantially affected by the timing of the commencement of operations as well as the development and construction of new facilities

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies see note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenues are derived from contracts with federal  state and local governmental agencies which pay either per diem rates based upon the number of occupant days or hours served for the period  on a take or pay basis  management fee basis  cost plus reimbursement or fee for service basis 
revenues are recognized as services are provided under our established contractual agreements to the extent collection is considered probable 
accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to the governmental agencies contracted with and other parties in the normal course of business 
we regularly review our outstanding receivables and historical collection experience and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we make judgments regarding our customers ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of 
table of contents these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may occur 
if  after reasonable collection efforts have been made  a receivable is determined to be permanently uncollectible  it is written off 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retention under self insurance programs 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for these losses through insurance reserves 
these reserves are influenced by rising costs of health care and other costs  increases in claims  time lags in claims information and levels of insurance coverage carried 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available to us  adjustments to the related loss reserves may occur 
our reserves for medical and worker s compensation claims are subject to change based on our estimate of the number and the magnitude of claims to be incurred 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment at least annually or when changes in circumstances or a triggering event indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets to be held and used recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable 
long lived assets to be held and used are to be reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value 
assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs 
we estimate fair value based upon the best information available  which may include expected future discounted cash flows to be produced by the asset and or available market prices 
factors that significantly influence estimated future discounted cash flows include the periods and levels of occupancy for the facility  expected per diem or reimbursement rates  assumptions regarding the levels of staffing  services and future operating and capital expenditures necessary to generate forecasted revenues  related costs for these activities and future rate of increases or decreases associated with these factors 
we also consider the results of any appraisals on the properties when assessing fair value 
these estimates may be highly subjective  particularly in circumstances where there is no current operating contract in place and changes in the assumptions and estimates could result in the recognition of impairment charges 
the most subjective estimates made in this analysis for relate to cornell abraxas  the regional correctional center and the hector garza residential treatment center 
the most subjective estimates made in this analysis for relate to the regional correctional center and the hector garza residential treatment center 
we may be required to record an impairment charge in the future if we are unable to successfully negotiate a replacement contract on any of our facilities for which we currently have an operating contract 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which states that there is no amortization of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives 
impairment of these assets is assessed annually to determine if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the net carrying value of the reporting unit  including the applicable goodwill 
the estimates of fair value are based upon our estimates of the present value of future cash flows 
we make assumptions regarding the estimated cash flows and if these estimates or their related assumptions change  an impairment charge may be incurred

cash flows from operations

additionally  we recognized a tax benefit on stock option exercises of approximately million and had payments of approximately million for financing costs related to our amended credit facility 
long term credit facilities 
our amended credit facility provides for borrowings up to million including letters of credit  matures in december and bears interest  at our election depending on our total leverage ratio  at either the libor rate plus a margin ranging from to  or a rate which ranges from to above the applicable prime rate 
the available commitment under our amended credit facility was approximately million at december  we had outstanding borrowings under our amended credit facility of million and we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million at december  subject to certain requirements  we have the right to increase the commitments under our amended credit facility up to million  although the indenture for our senior notes limits our ability  subject to certain conditions  to expand the amended credit facility beyond million 
we can provide no assurance that all of the banks that have made commitments to us under our amended credit facility would be willing to participate in an expansion to the amended credit facility should we desire to do so 
the amended credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including the assets and stock of all of our subsidiaries 
the amended credit facility is not secured by the assets of mcf  a special purpose entity 
our amended credit facility contains commonly used covenants including compliance with laws and limitations on certain financing transactions and mergers and also includes various financial covenants 
we believe the most restrictive covenant under our amended credit facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with all of our debt financial covenants 
mcf is obligated for the outstanding balance of its taxable revenue bonds  series the bonds bear interest at a rate of per annum and are payable in semi annual installments of interest and annual installments of principal 
all unpaid principal and accrued interest on the bonds is due on the earlier of august  maturity or as noted under the bond documents 
the bonds are limited  nonrecourse obligations of mcf and secured by the property and equipment  bond reserves  assignment of subleases and substantially all assets related to the facilities included in the sale and leaseback transaction in which we sold eleven facilities as identified in item of this report to mcf 
the bonds are not guaranteed by cornell 
in june  we issued million in principal of senior notes the senior notes due july  the senior notes are unsecured senior indebtedness and are guaranteed by all of our existing and future subsidiaries collectively  the guarantors 
the senior notes are not guaranteed by mcf the non guarantor 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on january and july of each year  commencing january  on or after july   we may redeem all or a portion of the senior notes at the redemption prices expressed as a percentage of the principal amount listed below  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on the senior notes redeemed  to the applicable date of redemption  if redeemed during the month period commencing on july of each of the years indicated below year percentages and thereafter upon the occurrence of specified change of control events  unless we have exercised our option to redeem all the senior notes as described above  each holder will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on the senior notes repurchased  to the applicable date of purchase 
the senior notes were issued under an indenture which limits our ability and the ability of our guarantors to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  make other restricted payments and investments  create liens  incur restrictions on the ability of the guarantors to pay dividends or other payments to us  enter into transactions with affiliates  and engage in mergers  consolidations and certain sales of assets 
in conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a financial 
table of contents institution to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value on million of our senior notes 
the purpose of this transaction was to convert future interest due on million of the senior notes to a variable rate 
the terms of the interest rate swap contract and the underlying debt instrument were identical 
the swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge 
the swap had a notional amount of million and matured in july to mirror the maturity of the senior notes 
under the agreement  we paid  on a semi annual basis each january and july  a floating rate based on a six month us dollar libor rate  plus a spread  and receive a fixed rate interest of 
for the year ended december   we recorded interest expense related to this interest rate swap of approximately million 
because the swap agreement was an effective fair value hedge  there was no effect on our results of operations from the mark to market adjustment while the swap was in effect 
in october  we terminated the swap agreement 
we received approximately million in conjunction with the termination  which is being amortized over the remaining term of the senior notes 
future liquidity our shelf registration statement on form s for potential offerings from time to time of up to million in gross proceeds of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants or certain other securities was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission in september we expect to use existing cash balances  internally generated cash flows and borrowings from our amended credit facility to fulfill anticipated obligations such as capital expenditures  working capital needs and scheduled debt maturities over at least the next twelve months 
as of december  we have approximately million of available capacity under our amended credit facility 
we will continue to analyze our capital structure  including a potential refinancing of our senior notes and financing for our expected future capital expenditures  including any potential acquisitions 
we will consider potential acquisitions from time to time 
our principal focus for acquisitions is anticipated to be in our adult secure and adult community based divisions  although we would also pursue attractively priced acquisitions in our abraxas youth and family services division 
we may decide to use internally generated funds  bank financing  equity issuances  debt issuances or a combination of any of the foregoing to finance our future capital needs 
at december  we believe we have sufficient liquidity necessary to complete those projects for which we have outstanding commitments 
our internally generated cash flow is directly related to our business 
should the private corrections and juvenile businesses deteriorate  or should we experience poor results in our operations  cash flow from operations may be reduced 
we have  however  continued to generate positive cash flow from operating activities over recent years and expect that cash flow will continue to be positive over the next year 
our access to debt and equity markets may be reduced or closed to us due to a variety of events  including  among others  restrictions under our senior notes indenture or our amended credit facility  industry conditions  general economic conditions  market conditions  credit rating agency downgrades of our debt and or market perceptions of us and our industry 
the extreme volatility seen in the financial markets beginning in the third quarter of has continued into the first quarter of and is expected to be present for the near term 
such volatility could result in decreased availability of capital at economical terms and could also put additional financial and budgetary pressure on our customers 
such conditions could potentially result in our inability to pursue additional future growth opportunities such as facility expansions or new facility construction and  if coupled with unexpected client  operational or other issues affecting our cash flow  in a need to seek additional financing at terms we would otherwise not accept 
in addition  our accounts receivable are with federal  state  county and local government agencies  which we believe generally reduces our credit risk 
however  it is possible that situations such as continuing budget resolutions  delayed passage of budgets or budget pressures  may increase the length of repayment of certain of these receivables 
contractual uncertainties related to certain facilities regional correctional center 
the office of federal detention trustee ofdt holds the contract for the use of the regional correctional center on behalf of ice  usms and the bop with bernalillo county through an intergovernmental services agreement  and we have an operating and management agreement with bernalillo county 
in july  we were notified by ice that it was removing all ice detainees from the regional correctional center and the removal was completed in early august the facility is still being utilized by the usms  and since may by the bop  but not at its full capacity 
in february  ice informed us that it would not resume use of the facility 
in february  ofdt attempted to unilaterally amend its agreement with the county to reduce the number of minimum annual guaranteed mandays under the agreement from  to  neither we nor the county believe ofdt has the right to unilaterally amend the contract in this manner  and ofdt has been informed of our position 
although either party to the intergovernmental services agreement has the right to terminate upon days notice  neither party has exercised such right as of december  also  there is a motion pending in a lawsuit against the county concerning the county jail system that could involve the regional correctional center in such case 
jimmy mcclendon and other plaintiffs sued the county in federal district court in 
table of contents the district of new mexico in over conditions at the county jail  which was then located at what is now the regional correctional center and run by the county 
the county subsequently built their new metropolitan detention center to house the county inmates and also negotiated two stipulated agreements in designed to end the mcclendon lawsuit 
the court in that case is considering the application of the lawsuit to the regional correctional center as a result of the county s ownership of the facility 
the county has informed us that  should the court rule that the case applies to the facility  it plans to appeal the decision since the county does not believe mcclendon should apply to the regional correctional center 
we do not believe we are contractually obligated to bear any incremental costs of complying with mcclendon although the county has expressed its desire for us to absorb a portion of any costs that would be incurred 
should the court rule that the lawsuit applies to the facility  we would further discuss the matter with the county 
we plan to continue to operate the facility and also continue with our marketing plans for the regional correctional center 
revenues for this facility were approximately million including a million contract based revenue adjustment for the contract year ended march and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net carrying value of the leasehold improvements for this facility was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
our lease for this facility requires monthly rent payments of approximately million for the remaining term of the lease through june 
to date  we have brought in the bop as an additional customer for this facility  however the facility still has available capacity 
our inability to expand the existing population with current or new customers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 no impairment to the carrying value of the leasehold improvements for this facility has occurred 
hector garza residential treatment center 
in october  we initiated the temporary closure of this mcf leased facility in san antonio  texas

we believe that  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 no impairment to the carrying value of this facility has occurred due to existing demand from current customers and anticipated incremental demand from additional multiple customers to whom the facility is being marketed
