item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the section titled risk factors in part i of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
dpi merger on september   discovery partners international  inc  or dpi  completed a merger with infinity pharmaceuticals  inc  or ipi  pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of dpi merged with and into ipi 
ipi was the surviving corporation in the merger  changed its name to infinity discovery  inc  or old infinity  and became a wholly owned subsidiary of dpi 
in addition  we changed our name from discovery partners international  inc to infinity pharmaceuticals  inc 
and our ticker symbol on the nasdaq global market to infi 
upon completion of the dpi merger  our common stock was issued to old infinity stockholders  and we assumed all of the stock options  stock warrants and restricted stock of old infinity outstanding as of september  immediately following the closing of the merger  former old infinity stockholders  option holders and warrant holders owned approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis and former dpi stockholders  option holders and warrant holders owned approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis 
in addition  after completion of the merger  the business conducted by the combined company became the one operated by old infinity prior to completion of the merger 
since former old infinity security holders owned  immediately following the dpi merger  approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis and as a result of certain other factors  including that former old infinity directors constituted a majority of the combined company s board of directors and all members of the combined company s executive management were from old infinity  old infinity was deemed to be the acquiring company for accounting purposes and the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of assets and a recapitalization in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  for all purposes  including sec reporting  our financial statements for periods prior to the merger reflect the historical results of old infinity  and not dpi  and our financial statements for all subsequent periods reflect the results of the combined company 
in addition  because the business conducted by the combined company became the one operated by old infinity prior to the completion of the merger  the discussion below describes the business of old infinity prior to completion of the merger and the business of the combined company after the merger 
unless specifically noted otherwise  as used herein  the terms infinity  we  us and our refer to the combined company after the merger and the business of old infinity prior to the merger  and dpi refers to the business of discovery partners international  inc prior to completion of the merger 
business overview our mission is to build a community and company capable of sustainably discovering  developing and delivering to patients innovative  important new medicines that will make a material difference in their health  well being and lives 
our lead product candidate  ipi retaspimycin hydrochloride is an intravenously administered small molecule inhibitor of heat shock protein  or hsp hsp is a central component of the cellular chaperone 
table of contents system a system that supports and stabilizes cancer causing proteins such as c kit  egfr  and her  enabling multiple forms of cancer to thrive 
inhibition of the hsp chaperone knocks out this critical source of support for cancer cells  leading to tumor growth inhibition and cancer cell death 
thus  targeted anti chaperone therapy via inhibition of hsp may represent a significant yet currently unaddressed strategy for treating patients with cancer 
in october  we commenced an international phase registration study of ipi in patients with refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors  or gist  based on the activity and safety data from a phase trial reported in this registration study  called the ring retaspimycin hydrochloride in gist trial  is being conducted under a special protocol assessment agreement with the us food and drug administration  or fda  and pursuant to scientific advice from the european medicines agency 
we estimate that this trial will be completed by the end of  positioning ipi as the potential first to market inhibitor of hsp ipi is also being evaluated as a single agent in the expansion phase of the phase portion of a phase clinical trial in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc  and in a phase b clinical trial in combination with taxotere docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors 
additional clinical trials of ipi  including a trial in her positive metastatic breast cancer  are expected to commence in in july  we commenced a phase clinical trial of ipi  an orally delivered inhibitor of hsp  in patients with advanced solid tumors 
this trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of ipi and to identify a dose and schedule for further clinical development 
biological activity of ipi is being measured by computed tomography  or ct  imaging using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors  otherwise known as recist  as well as disease specific markers 
in december  we reacquired from medimmune  inc  an affiliate of astrazeneca plc  all worldwide development and commercialization rights for our hsp program  which includes ipi and ipi we refer to medimmune in this report as medimmune az 
our next most advanced program is directed against the hedgehog signaling pathway  or hedgehog pathway 
the hedgehog pathway is highly active in regulating tissue and organ formation during embryonic development 
when abnormally activated  the hedgehog pathway is believed to play a central role in allowing the proliferation and survival of several types of cancers  including pancreatic  prostate  lung  breast and certain brain cancers 
the lead candidate in our hedgehog pathway program  ipi  has shown potent and selective inhibition of the hedgehog pathway as well as anti tumor activity in preclinical models 
in october  we commenced a phase clinical trial evaluating ipi in patients with advanced and or metastatic solid tumors 
the primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and pharmacokinetics of ipi and to determine a recommended dose and schedule for subsequent studies 
additionally  we will evaluate potential anti tumor activity of ipi and examine pharmacodynamic markers of its biological activity 
we are pursuing our hedgehog pathway program in collaboration with mundipharma international corporation limited  or mundipharma 
we also have a discovery program directed to fatty acid amide hydrolase  or faah  an emerging target for neuropathic pain 
the enzyme faah degrades anandamide  which is an endogenous cannabanoid that produces an analgesic effect in response to pain and nerve injury 
faah inhibition increases the duration of anandamide s analgesic effect  prolonging pain relief at the site of release 
in early  we selected a clinical candidate  ipi  in this program and are conducting studies directed to the filing of an investigational new drug application  or ind  with the fda 
we are pursuing our faah program in collaboration with mundipharma and an independent associated company  purdue pharmaceutical products lp  or purdue 
we have spent  and expect to continue to spend  significant resources to fund the research and development of ipi  ipi  ipi  ipi and our other drug candidates 
while we may have net income in future periods as the result of non recurring collaboration income  as we did in the year ended december   we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses over the next several years as our clinical trial and drug manufacturing activities for our hsp program increase and as we incur pre commercialization expenses in anticipation of a potential commercial launch of ipi 
table of contents collaboration agreements purdue and mundipharma 
in november  we entered into strategic alliance agreements with each of mundipharma and purdue to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products 
the alliance includes product candidates that inhibit or target the hedgehog pathway and faah  and product candidates arising out of all our discovery projects in all disease fields that achieve development candidate status on or before december  with mundipharma having the right  through the exercise of two consecutive one year options  to extend such period through december  
we refer to such three to five year period as the funded discovery period 
our hsp and bcl programs are expressly excluded from the alliance 
the agreement with purdue is focused on the development and commercialization of products targeting faah for sale in the united states 
the agreement with mundipharma is focused on the development and commercialization of all products and product candidates covered by the alliance  including those targeting faah  for sale outside of the united states 
we have responsibility and decision making authority for the performance of early discovery projects and the development of all product candidates on a worldwide basis 
mundipharma will pay for of all research and development expenses incurred by infinity for early discovery projects and product candidates included in the alliance until the later of december  and the commencement of the first phase clinical study of such product candidate 
we refer to such date as the transition date 
after the transition date for each product candidate other than those arising out of the faah project  mundipharma and infinity will share all research and development costs for such product candidate equally 
upon completion of the first phase clinical study of the first product developed under the research program that inhibits or targets faah  purdue and mundipharma may elect to assume responsibility  at their own expense  for the future development and commercialization of faah products for sale in and outside of the united states  respectively 
we are recording revenue for reimbursable research and development services we perform for mundipharma and purdue 
we recorded million in such revenue in the year ended december  mundipharma has the right to opt out of any early discovery project or any preclinical or clinical development program on an annual basis in november of each year 
mundipharma also has a one time right in mid to opt out of either or both of the hedgehog development program or the faah project 
in the event of an opt out decision  mundipharma  together with purdue with respect to the faah program  will continue to provide funding for  in the aggregate  of our budgeted research and development expenses for the applicable project or program for one year after the date of such opt out 
purdue has a comparable opt out right with respect to the faah project 
in addition  we and mundipharma each have the right to opt out of continued development of a product candidate after it has reached the transition date  with a one year tail funding obligation for its of post transition date research and development expenses 
if a party exercises its right to opt out of the development of a product or product candidate after the transition date  the other party may elect to continue the development and assume responsibility for the worldwide commercialization of such product or product candidate  subject to the payment of a royalty 
except as set forth above with respect to faah products and opt out products  we will have the right and responsibility to market and sell products arising from the research program in the united states and mundipharma will have the right and responsibility to market and sell products arising from the research program outside of the united states 
other than pursuant to the strategic alliance agreements  neither infinity nor mundipharma may develop  manufacture or commercialize products that arise out of the research program or products that are directed to the same target or pathway as a product included in the research program  unless and until a party terminates its rights with respect to such products 
if we in license any product or product candidate during the funded discovery period for which commercialization rights outside of the united states are available for grant by infinity to mundipharma  mundipharma will have the option to include such in licensed product or product candidate in the alliance by paying infinity a prescribed percentage of the up front license fee or other acquisition cost  which percentage could be up to of such fee or cost  in order for mundipharma to obtain rights in all countries outside of the 
table of contents united states  and by funding research and development costs in the same manner as products or product candidates arising out of infinity s internal discovery programs 
the agreement with mundipharma provides for the agreed upon research and development budgets to be updated to reflect the inclusion of any in licensed products or product candidates 
there will be no royalties paid between the parties on in licensed candidates 
except with respect to products that have been in licensed by us  for which no royalties will be payable between the parties  we are obligated to pay mundipharma a royalty on net sales of the commercialized products until such time as mundipharma has recovered all research and development expenses paid to us under the research program prior to the applicable transition date 
after such cost recovery  we will owe a tiered  to royalty on us net sales of those products 
for products in which mundipharma has opted out of development prior to the transition date  we will owe royalties of to of net sales as a function of the stage of development of the applicable product candidate at the time of opt out 
for products in which either party has opted out of development following the transition date  the commercializing party will pay the other party a royalty on net sales 
mundipharma is obligated to pay us a tiered  to royalty on calendar year net sales outside of the united states of each product arising out of the alliance  and purdue is obligated to pay us a tiered  to royalty on calendar year net sales of faah products in the united states 
royalties are payable until the later to occur of the last to expire of specified patent rights and the expiration of non patent regulatory exclusivities in a country  provided that if royalties are payable solely on the basis of non patent regulatory exclusivity  each of the rates above are reduced by one half 
in addition  all royalties payable under the strategic alliance agreements  whether by infinity  purdue or mundipharma  are subject to reduction on account of third party royalty payments or patent litigation damages or settlements  with any such reductions capped at of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period 
in connection with the entry into the strategic alliance agreements  we also entered into a securities purchase agreement and line of credit agreement with purdue and its independent associated company  purdue pharma lp  or pplp 
in march  purdue assigned its interest under the line of credit agreement to pplp 
under the securities purchase agreement we issued and sold in november an aggregate of four million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
of the initial closing shares  two million shares of our common stock were purchased by each purchaser 
in january  we conducted a second closing where we issued and sold an aggregate of two million shares of our common stock  and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of six million shares of our common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
of the second closing shares and warrants  an equal number were purchased by each purchaser 
the line of credit agreement provides for the borrowing by us of one or more unsecured loans up to an aggregate maximum principal amount of million 
the loans may be drawn by us during the three year period beginning on april  the loans  which may be used by us for any proper corporate purpose  mature on april   which we refer to as the maturity date  and will be subordinate to any senior indebtedness that we may incur 
borrowings made under the line of credit agreement will bear interest  payable on the maturity date  at a fluctuating rate set at the prime rate on the business day prior to the funding of each loan and will be reset on the last business day of each month ending thereafter 
interest will be compounded on each successive three month anniversary of the funding of each loan 
outstanding loans may be prepaid without penalty or premium prior to the maturity date 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement  once borrowed  may not be borrowed again 
we have certain rights to repay outstanding amounts under the line of credit agreement in shares of our common stock 
in  we recorded million as deferred revenue associated with the grant of licenses to mundipharma and purdue representing the excess of the amount paid by purdue and purdue pharma  lp for our common stock per share over the closing market price on the day before the first equity closing per share 
in the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue in connection with the amortization of the deferred revenue 
in january  we will record the additional equity and warrants issued to purdue and purdue pharma  lp at the second equity closing at their fair value as of the first equity closing  and the excess of the amount paid over fair value as deferred revenue 
we considered our obligation  absent material 
table of contents adverse changes  to issue purdue and purdue pharma  lp the second equity closing shares and warrants as a forward contract with immaterial intrinsic value  which was recorded in stockholders equity 
the deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue ratably over our estimated period of performance under the arrangement  which is years 
we will periodically review this estimate and make adjustments as facts and circumstances dictate 
there are no joint steering committees for the strategic alliances 
the extension of the line of credit at an interest rate below our incremental borrowing rate represents the transfer of additional value to us in the arrangement 
as such  we have recorded the fair value of the line of credit of million as a loan commitment asset on our balance sheet in  which we will amortize to interest expense over the life of the loan arrangement  or the years commencing on april  because purdue and its associated companies became significant related parties as a result of the equity issuances  we recorded the offset to this asset as additional paid in capital in medimmune az 
in august  we entered into a product development and commercialization agreement with medimmune az to jointly develop and commercialize cancer drugs targeting hsp and the hedgehog pathway 
in november  we regained from medimmune az worldwide development and commercialization rights under our hedgehog pathway program and in december  we reacquired from medimmune az worldwide development and commercialization rights to our hsp inhibitor program 
under the terms of this agreement  we shared equally with medimmune az all development costs  as well as potential profits and losses  from any future marketed products 
medimmune az made non refundable  up front payments totaling million to us in order to obtain co exclusive rights to the hsp and hedgehog pathway development programs  and paid a million milestone to us in upon initiation of the ring trial 
upon the reacquisition of rights to the hsp program  we recognized all of the remaining deferred revenue related to the up front license fee from medimmune az  as we had no further performance obligations to medimmune az 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of  from such fee 
further  because the agreement was a cost sharing arrangement rather than one in which research and development expenses were reimbursed  we recorded amounts reimbursable by medimmune az with respect to research and development prior to the date we reacquired the hsp program as a reduction to research and development expense  and not as revenue 
for the year ended december   we offset approximately million in amounts reimbursable by medimmune az against research and development expense 
the million in reimbursable amounts incurred between the date on which the hsp program was reacquired and december  is recorded as income from residual funding in our statement of operations 
following the reacquisition of the hsp program  medimmune az remained obligated to fund an amount equivalent to its share of hsp program costs for the ensuing six month period 
in january  however  we agreed with medimmune az to settle these residual funding obligations through lump sum payments totaling million  which we intend to record as income from residual funding in our statement of operations in the first quarter of the profit and cost sharing provisions of our arrangement with medimmune az are no longer applicable  and we have full control over all future development and commercialization activities under our hsp and hedgehog pathway programs  subject to the payment of single digit royalties to medimmune az on worldwide net sales  if any  of each of ipi and ipi we do not have a royalty obligation to medimmune az on any future sales of ipi novartis 
in february  we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis institute for biomedical research  inc  or novartis  to discover  develop and commercialize drugs targeting bcl protein family members for the treatment of a broad range of cancers 
under the terms of this agreement  we granted to novartis an exclusive  worldwide license to research  develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products that are based upon our proprietary bcl inhibitors 
novartis paid us a million up front license fee  which we were originally recognizing over an estimated period of performance of four years  an affiliate of novartis made a million equity investment in us  and novartis committed to provide us research funding of approximately million over the initial two year research term  which expired in february pursuant to this agreement  we 
table of contents conducted joint research with novartis to identify molecules for clinical development 
novartis now has responsibility for further pre clinical  clinical development and commercialization of any products based upon compounds discovered under the joint research program 
because we had no further performance obligations to novartis  we recognized the remaining balance of deferred revenue in the first quarter of we may request to participate in clinical development of any such products and  if such request is agreed upon by novartis  novartis will fund agreed upon development costs that are incurred by us 
we also have a non exclusive right to detail bcl family inhibitor products in the united states  with our detailing costs to be reimbursed by novartis 
novartis has agreed to make milestone payments totaling over million if certain specified research  development and commercialization milestones are achieved for multiple products for multiple indications  such that total payments to us could exceed million 
novartis has also agreed to pay us royalties upon successful commercialization of any products developed under the alliance 
technology access alliances 
we have also entered into technology access alliances with amgen inc  or amgen  novartis international pharmaceutical ltd  or novartis international  and johnson johnson pharmaceutical research development  a division of janssen pharmaceutical nv  or j j  relating to our diversity oriented synthesis technology 
as of december   we had successfully completed all of our obligations to our partners under these agreements 
we do  however  have the right to receive milestone payments under two of these agreements if our alliance partner develops and successfully commercializes products based upon certain compounds licensed to them under the applicable agreement 
financial overview revenue all of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees  the reimbursement of research and development costs  contract service revenue and milestones payments received from our collaboration partners 
where the agreement with a collaboration partner  such as our agreements with purdue and novartis  provide that the partner will provide research funding for our research and development efforts  we recognize this cost reimbursement as revenue in the period earned 
in the future  we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales  research and development support services and milestone payments in connection with strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees  research and development reimbursement  milestone and other payments earned under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments that we earn upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
if we fail to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them  our ability to generate future revenue  and our results of operations and financial position  would be materially adversely affected 
research development expense since inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs  with particular emphasis on cancer drugs 
our primary research and development programs include ipi  an intravenously administered hsp inhibitor for which we are conducting a phase clinical trial in patients with refractory gist  and which is also being evaluated as a single agent in advanced non small cell lung cancer and in combination with docetaxel in patients with solid tumors  ipi  an orally delivered hsp inhibitor  for which we initiated a phase clinical trial in july in patients with advanced solid tumors  ipi  the orally delivered lead candidate in our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program  for which we commenced a phase clinical trial in patients with advanced and or metastatic solid tumors in october  and ipi  the clinical development candidate for neuropathic pain targeting fatty acid amide hydrolase faah 

table of contents our research and development expense primarily consists of the following compensation of personnel associated with research activities  including consultants and contract research organizations  laboratory supplies and materials  manufacturing drug candidates for preclinical testing and clinical studies  preclinical testing costs  including costs of toxicology studies  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  depreciation of equipment  and allocated costs of facilities 
under our collaboration with medimmune az  we shared research and development expenses equally with medimmune az 
in december  we reacquired from medimmune az worldwide development and commercialization rights to our hsp program 
reimbursable amounts from medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of the parties collaboration agreement incurred prior to our reacquisition of the hsp program are recorded as a reduction of research and development expense in our statements of operations 
reimbursable amounts from medimmune az incurred following the reacquisition of the hsp program are recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program on our statements of operations 
this cost sharing arrangement also applied to our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program through may  because this was a cost sharing arrangement  we recorded appropriate reimbursable amounts from medimmune az for its share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense 
general administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology infrastructure  corporate communications and human resources functions 
other costs include facilities costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  professional fees for legal and accounting services and early commercial development costs 
general and administrative expense also consists of the costs of maintaining and overseeing our intellectual property portfolio  which include the salaries of in house patent counsel  the cost of external counsel and the associated filing and maintenance fees 
other income expense interest expense and other interest and investment income primarily consist of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  and interest expense  which includes amortization of warrants 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses  assumptions in the valuation of stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to aid you in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 

table of contents revenue recognition to date  our revenue has been generated under research collaboration agreements and  accordingly  we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and eitf no 
 revenue recognition gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the terms of these research collaboration agreements may include payment to us of non refundable up front license fees  funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts  milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved  and or royalties on product sales 
we divide agreements containing multiple elements into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborative partner and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
for these agreements  we allocate the consideration that we receive among the separate units based on their respective fair values or the residual method  and we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria to each of the separate units 
we recognize revenue from non refundable  up front license fees on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance  which is typically the research or development term 
we recognize research and development funding as earned over the period of effort 
we regularly consider whether events warrant a change in the estimated period of performance under an agreement 
such a change would cause us to modify the period of time over which we recognize revenue from the up front license fees paid to us under that agreement and would  in turn  result in changes in our quarterly and annual results 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if the milestone payment is non refundable  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone and the milestone is at risk for both parties 
if any of these conditions is not met  we defer the milestone payment and recognize it as revenue over the estimated period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 
we will recognize royalty revenue  if any  based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by the licensee  and in the period the sales occur 
we have not recognized any royalty revenue to date 
we exercise our judgment in determining whether an agreement contains multiple elements and  if so  how much revenue is allocable to each element 
in addition  we exercise our judgment in determining when our significant obligations have been met under such agreements and the specific time periods over which we recognize revenue  such as non refundable  up front license fees 
to the extent that actual facts and circumstances differ from our initial judgments  our revenue recognition with respect to such transactions would change accordingly and any such change could affect our reported operating results 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
we have entered into certain collaboration agreements in which expenses are shared with the collaborator  and others in which we are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of the collaborator 
we record all of these expenses as research and development expense 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we receive payments from the collaborator  we record payments from the collaborator for its share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we make payments to the collaborator  we will record our payments to the collaborator for its share of the development effort as additional research and development 
table of contents expense 
if the arrangement provides for reimbursement of research and development expenses  we record the reimbursement as revenue 
our collaboration with medimmune az was a cost sharing arrangement  our collaboration with novartis provided for the reimbursement of our research and development expenses 
our collaboration with purdue also provides for the reimbursement of our research and development expenses 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of services for which we must estimate accrued expenses include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with pharmaceutical development work and to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials and preclinical studies 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred by our service providers  or if we over or under estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in any given period  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
we often rely on subjective judgments to determine the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
to date  we have been able to reasonably estimate these costs  but our estimates of expenses in future periods may be over or under accrued 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under financial accounting standards board statement sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity compensation 
we use the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of equity awards 
we use our judgment in determining the fair value of our common stock  including in selecting the inputs we use for the black scholes valuation model 
equity instrument valuation models are by their nature highly subjective 
any significant changes in any of our judgments  including those used to select the inputs for the black scholes valuation model  could have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity instruments granted or sold and the associated compensation charge  if any  we record in our financial statements 
income taxes we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss carryforwards  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we account for income taxes under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

in february  the fasb issued staff position  which deferred the effective date of sfas no

new accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on issue  accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
eitf requires collaborators to present the results of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from  or made to  other collaborators based on other applicable generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
further  eitf clarified that the determination of whether transactions within a collaborative arrangement are part of a vendor customer or analogous relationship subject to eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf will be effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we do not believe that eitf will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

table of contents million related to reimbursable research and development services we performed under our strategic alliances entered into with mundipharma and purdue in november our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million associated with the amortization of the up front license fee received from medimmune az upon entry into our strategic alliance  million related to the amortization of the non refundable license fee  and million related to the reimbursable research and development services we performed  under our bcl collaboration entered into with novartis  and million related to the acceptance of compounds by novartis international under our technology access agreement 
we currently expect that all of our revenue in will be derived from our alliances with purdue and mundipharma 
research and development expense research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  and of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expense is primarily attributable to an increase of million in expenses for clinical trials of ipi  ipi and ipi  an increase of million in pharmaceutical development expenses as our hsp and hedgehog programs have advanced  and an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including sfas no 
r stock based compensation  for our research and development personnel  which was primarily driven by the hiring of new research and development personnel  our contingent cash compensation program and annual base salary increases 
this million increase in research and development expenditures was partially offset by an increase of million in amounts reimbursable by medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement 
the following table sets forth our estimates of research and development expenses  by program  over the last two years 
these expenses primarily relate to payroll and related expenses for personnel working on the programs  drug development and manufacturing  preclinical toxicology studies and clinical trial costs 
our hsp program and hedgehog pathway inhibitors programs were being conducted in collaboration with medimmune az 
we reacquired all development and worldwide commercialization rights to our hsp program and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs in december and november  respectively 
under this collaboration  we shared research and development expenses equally with medimmune az 
pursuant to our cost sharing agreement  reimbursable amounts from medimmune az were credited to research and development expenses for our hsp program through december  and for our hedgehog pathway inhibitors program through may  the expenses for the hsp and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs include credits of approximately million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december   attributable to amounts reimbursable by medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement 
program year ended december  year ended december  hsp million million hedgehog pathway inhibitors million million bcl million million 
table of contents we began to track and accumulate costs by major programs starting on january  our research and development costs prior to december  were largely related to hsp we do not believe that the historical costs associated with our lead drug development programs are indicative of the future costs associated with these programs or represent what any other future drug development program we initiate may cost 
due to the variability in the length of time and scope of activities necessary to develop a drug candidate  uncertainties related to cost estimates and our ability to obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total costs required to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
we expect our hsp program expenses to increase as we seek to advance ipi into additional and later stage clinical trials and make progress in clinical development of ipi in addition  we expect expenses for our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program to increase as we make progress in the clinical development of ipi we do not expect to incur any future research and development expenses for the bcl program because our research obligations under our collaboration with novartis ended in february we also expect hsp and hedgehog pathway inhibitor expenses to increase as a result of medimmune az no longer funding half of the expenses on these programs 
general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including sfas no 
r stock based compensation expense for general and administrative employees  which was primarily driven by the hiring of new general and administrative personnel  the contingent cash compensation program and annual base salary increases  and an increase of million in consulting expenses  principally related to early commercial development and public relations services 
we expect our general and administrative expense to increase in in support of our research and development initiatives and as we begin to establish commercial capabilities 
interest and investment income interest and investment income decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower yields on our available for sale securities and cash equivalents and the lower quarterly average balance of available for sale securities and cash equivalents due to our cash burn and the timing of cash receipts during the year 
we expect interest and investment income to be lower in primarily due to lower expected yields  partially offset by higher average balances due to the purdue transaction 
interest expense we expect to record interest expense in future years related to the amortization of the loan commitment asset from the purdue transaction 
income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program following our reacquisition of the hsp program in december  medimmune az remained obligated to fund an amount equivalent to its share of hsp program costs for the ensuing six month period 
reimbursable amounts from the date of reacquisition december  to december  are recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program 
in january  we agreed with medimmune az to settle the residual funding obligations through lump sum payments totaling million  which will also be recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program in the first quarter of

research and development expense research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  and of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expense is primarily attributable to an increase of million in reimbursable amounts from medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement  which are recorded as a credit to research and development expense 
this increase in reimbursable amounts was principally the result of costs under the medimmune az collaboration being shared for only four months of the year ended december  notwithstanding the amounts reimbursable by medimmune az  we recorded an increase of million in pharmaceutical development expenses as our hsp and hedgehog programs have advanced  and 
table of contents an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including sfas no 
r stock based compensation  for our research and development personnel  which was driven by the hiring of new research and development personnel  annual base salary increases and larger annual stock option grants 
the following table sets forth our estimates of research and development expenses  by program  over the years ending december  and these expenses primarily relate to payroll and related expenses for personnel working on the programs  drug development and manufacturing  preclinical toxicology studies and clinical trial costs 
under our collaboration with medimmune az  we shared research and development expenses equally with medimmune az 
the cost sharing agreement applied to our hsp program and our hedgehog pathway inhibitors program during the year ended december   and also for the last four months of the year ended december  the expenses for the hsp and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs include credits of approximately million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december   attributable to amounts reimbursable by medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement 
program year ended december  year ended december  hsp million million hedgehog pathway inhibitors million million bcl million million general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including sfas no

interest expense interest expense decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the repayment in december of all of our outstanding debt to oxford finance corporation  or oxford  and horizon technology funding company llc  or horizon 
interest and investment income interest and investment income increased by million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of our higher average balance of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities during  which was  in turn  primarily attributable to amounts received upon completion of the dpi merger and up front license fees received from medimmune az and novartis in connection with our collaborations 
debt extinguishment charge in connection with the early retirement of our outstanding indebtedness to oxford and horizon in december  we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of approximately million during the year ended december  this debt extinguishment charge represents the write off of the unamortized portion of the 
table of contents warrants that we issued to oxford and horizon when we originally entered into these debt facilities  as well as a prepayment penalty 
liquidity and capital resources we have not generated any revenue from the sale of drugs to date  and we do not expect to generate any such revenue for the next several years  if at all 
we have instead relied on the proceeds from sales of equity securities  interest and investment income on cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  license fees  expense reimbursement under our collaborations  milestone payments  contract service payments and debt to fund our operations 
because our drug candidates are in varying stages of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain  we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates or whether  or when  we may achieve profitability 
other significant capital resources are as follows december  december  cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities working capital years ended december  cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above financing activities cash flows the principal use of cash in operating activities in all of the periods presented was the funding of our research and development expenses  which increase as the pipeline advances 
cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors  including changes in accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable  as well as changes in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
in november  we entered into strategic alliances with mundipharma and purdue and issued four million shares of our common stock to purdue and one of its independent associated companies for cash proceeds of million 
of this amount  these shares were recorded at million  which represents the fair market value of our issued common stock and recorded in our cash flows from financing activities and million was accounted for as an up front license fee in deferred revenue and recorded in our cash flows from operating activities 
our reacquisition of the hsp program from medimmune az in december resulted in a million decrease in deferred revenue 
in february  novartis chose not to exercise its options for two one year extensions of the research period under our bcl collaboration  thus resulting in an million decrease in deferred revenue 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  included an increase in unbilled accounts receivable primarily due to the strategic alliances with mundipharma and purdue and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to our contingent cash compensation program and higher research and development activities 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included million in purchases of available for sale securities  proceeds of million from maturities of available for sale securities and proceeds of million from sales of available for sale securities 
capital expenditures in the year ended december  primarily consisted of laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements for additional office space 
in january  we received million from medimmune az  representing the second half of the up front license fee related to our collaboration agreement  which was recorded as an unbilled receivable as of december  cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december  included higher stock based compensation as well as increased net accretion on available for sale securities  as we invested portions of the medimmune az and novartis up front license fees and the proceeds from the dpi merger into available for sale securities 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  also included an increase to accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to higher research and development activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included million in purchases of available for sale securities and million in maturities of available for sale securities 
capital expenditures in the year ended december  primarily consisted of laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements for a new process scale up laboratory 
we will need substantial additional funds to support our planned operations 
in the absence of additional funding and based on our current operating plans  we expect that our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with the million line of credit that has been made available to us by an entity associated with purdue  are sufficient to fund our planned operations through the end of we may  however  need to raise additional funds before that date if our research and development expenses exceed our current expectations or if we do not receive the payments we expect to receive from mundipharma and purdue 
this could occur for many reasons  including some or all of our drug candidates fail in clinical or preclinical studies and we are forced to seek additional drug candidates  our drug candidates require more extensive clinical or preclinical testing than we currently expect  we advance more of our drug candidates than expected into costly later stage clinical trials  we advance more preclinical drug candidates than expected into early stage clinical trials  the cost of acquiring raw materials for  and of manufacturing  our drug candidates is higher than anticipated  we are required  or consider it advisable  to acquire or license intellectual property rights from one or more third parties  we acquire or license rights to additional drug candidates or new technologies from one or more third parties  mundipharma or purdue elects to discontinue its participation in a partnered program  or we experience a loss in our investments due to general market conditions or other reasons 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings of equity or debt securities  but such financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  particularly in light of current market conditions 
in addition  the terms of our financings may be dilutive to  or otherwise adversely affect  holders of our common stock  and such terms may impact our ability to make capital expenditures or incur additional debt 
we may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties  or through project financing 
these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or 
table of contents drug candidates  and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis  we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our development programs  including some or all of our drug candidates 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond capital lease  including interest software contract obligation operating lease obligations other operating lease obligations facilities total contractual cash obligations in addition to the contractual obligations in the table above  long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest totaling approximately million at december  are not included in the contractual obligations table because  due to their nature  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing activities  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since a significant portion of our investments are in money market funds  corporate obligations  and us government sponsored enterprise obligations 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments
