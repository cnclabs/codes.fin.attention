we also concluded that providing for the correction of the error in would not have a material effect on our financial statements for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate related to the additional provision noted previously  was partially offset by the reduction in foreign tax rates  the mixture of jurisdictional earnings  and the recognition of previously unbenefited deferred tax assets

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures and pay our long term liabilities 
since our inception  we have funded our operations through our initial public offering  private placements of equity securities  short term borrowings and funds generated from our operations 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and related financial instruments were million  as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents of million are highly liquid investments with maturity of days or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions 
our marketable securities of million consist of investments in various state and municipal governments  corporate bonds  commercial paper and us government sponsored enterprises  all of which mature by january  our long term investments and related financial instruments  which includes ars with a fair market value of million and a related right with a fair market value of million  consist primarily of tax exempt certificates with an auction reset feature auction rate securities  with underlying assets consisting generally of student loans  which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions began to fail for auction rate securities and each auction since then has failed 
based on the overall failure rate of these auctions  the frequency of the failures  and the underlying maturities of the securities  a portion of which are greater than years  we have classified auction rate securities as long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
during the year ended december   certain investments in arss were successfully called at full par value and we received cash proceeds of approximately million 
in january  an additional million in cash proceeds was received by us related to certain investments in arss that were successfully called at full par value 
on november   we agreed to accept auction rate security rights  or rights  from ubs financial services inc the rights permit us to sell  or put  our auction rate securities back to ubs at par value at any time during the period from june  through july  we expect to exercise these rights and put our auction rate securities back to ubs on june   the earliest date allowable under the rights 
these rights are nontransferable securities registered with the us securities and exchange commission 
as a result of accepting the rights  we have released ubs and its employees agents from all claims except claims for consequential damages directly or indirectly relating to ubs s marketing and sale of ars and agreed not to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any class action settlement or investor fund 
simultaneously  we transferred our ars investments  at their fair value of million  from available for sale to trading marketable securities 
as a result of this transfer  the company recognized an other than temporary loss of million in loss gain on investments in our statement of operations 
we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the rights will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related ars  both of which will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on an ongoing basis 
we measured the value of the rights under the provisions of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements and recorded an offsetting gain of million in loss gain on investments  and a corresponding non current asset 
based on our expectations for future operating cash flows and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
the recent disruptions in the financial and credit markets have also reduced access to cash by our customers and potential customers 
if the capital spending of our customers or potential customers continues to decrease  demand for our products would likely be adversely affected and our revenue will likely decline 
challenging economic and credit conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services for which they have contracted 
while we continue to complete appropriate credit review of our customers prior to shipment of product and revenue recognition  we may be required to write off accounts receivable that become uncollectible 

table of contents our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our current and future products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and continued progress of our research and development of new products 
due to certain capital expenditures incurred during the year ended december   including the expansion of our corporate headquarters facility and the implementation of a new financial software system  we expect that capital expenditures during the next months will be less than our capital expenditures during the months ended december  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as well as cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  this resulted primarily from net income for the period of million  approximately million in depreciation and stock based compensation expense  and approximately million in bad debt expense related to the write off of uncollectible accounts from certain customers affected by the overall economic environment during the fourth quarter of  partially offset by approximately million in deferred income tax benefits 
net changes in working capital items reduced cash from operating activities by approximately million  principally due to an increase in inventory for anticipated future sales and lower than expected sales for the fourth quarter  as well as an increase in accounts receivable reflecting the record sales during  an overall slowdown in collections as certain customers were affected by the overall economic environment and the tightening of the credit markets and an increase in accounts payable and amounts due to a related party 
these were partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   which consisted primarily of million used to purchase marketable securities and million used for fixed asset purchases  offset by million in proceeds generated from sales and maturities of securities 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  principally relating to proceeds from option exercises of million  tax benefits related to stock options of million and partially offset by million in payments on capital lease obligations

contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our capital leases from equipment financings and our facilities leases 
in addition  we guaranteed the lease obligations for two facilities that are operated by sona medspa and will be obligated to pay these leases if sona medspa can not or does not make the required lease payments 
we have summarized in the table below our fixed contractual cash obligations as of december  total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years in thousands capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases lease guarantees total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth above are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgment and estimates by us in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we recognize revenue from sales of aesthetic treatment systems and accessories when each of the following four criteria are met delivery has occurred  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents revenue from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period as services are provided 
we are party to a revenue sharing arrangement with an operator and franchisor of spa franchises and recognize revenue from this arrangement in the period in which the procedures are performed 
we defer  until earned  payments that we receive in advance of product delivery or performance of services 
when we enter into arrangements with multiple elements  which may include sales of products together with service contracts and warranties  we allocate revenue among the elements based on each element s relative fair value in accordance with the principles of emerging issues task force issue number  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this allocation requires us to make estimates of fair value for each element 
accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared with million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million and as of december  was million 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the aging of our receivable balances  known collectibility issues and our historical experience with losses 
during the year ended december   we wrote off uncollectible accounts totaling approximately million as bad debt expense  related to certain customers inability to meet their payment obligations to us  primarily during the fourth quarter  which we believe was a result of the overall economic environment 
prior to the fourth quarter of  our credit losses were historically within our expectations and the allowances that we had established  however  we believe we may continue to experience credit losses  which could cause our provisions for doubtful accounts to increase 
we work to mitigate bad debt exposure through our credit evaluation policies  reasonably short payment terms and geographical dispersion of sales 
our revenues include export sales to foreign companies located principally in europe  the asia pacific region and the middle east 
we obtain letters of credit for foreign sales that we consider to be at risk 
inventories and allowance for excess and obsolescence we state all inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out method 
we monitor standard costs on a monthly basis and update them annually and as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
our inventory balance was million as of december  compared to million as of december  our inventory allowance as of december  was million and as of december  was million 
we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when we sell products 
product warranty costs and provisions we provide a one year parts and labor warranty on end user sales of our aesthetic treatment systems 
distributor sales generally include a warranty on parts only 
we estimate and provide for future costs for initial product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we base product warranty costs on related material costs  technical support labor costs and overhead 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties by considering historical material  labor and overhead expenses and applying the experience rates to the outstanding warranty period for products sold 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates and warranty costs 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differ from our estimates  we would be required to revise our estimated warranty liability

defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas no 
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes the following fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable markets data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
our long term investments and related financial instruments consist of tax exempt certificates with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars whose underlying assets are generally student loans  which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed  with one exception 
to date  we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ars when due and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
during the year ended december   certain investments in ars were successfully called at full par value and we received cash proceeds of approximately million 
in january  we received an additional million in cash proceeds related to certain investments in arss that were successfully called at full par value 
while the auction failures will limit our ability to liquidate these investments  we believe that the ars failures will not have an impact on our ability to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives 
we continue to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments 
as of december   we held million  at par value  of auction rate securities investments 
the auction rate securities are managed by ubs financial services  inc ubs 
on november   we agreed to accept auction rate security rights the rights from ubs offered through a prospectus filed on october  the rights permit us to sell  or put  our ars at par value to ubs at any time during the period from june  through july  we expect to exercise our ars rights and put our auction rate securities to ubs on june   the earliest date allowable under the rights 
as a result of accepting the right  we transferred the ars investments  at their fair value of million  from available for sale to trading marketable securities  in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of this transfer  we recognized an other than temporary loss of million in other income expense in the statement of operations  and we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the ars will be mostly offset by the changes in the fair value of the related rights  both of which will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on an ongoing basis 
as a result of the illiquidity in the market for ars investments  we have estimated the fair value of our ars and the rights using a level valuation methodology 
we measured the value of the rights under the provisions of fasb statement no 
 and recorded a gain of million in other income expense  and a corresponding non current asset within the consolidated balance sheet 
given the current failures in the auction markets to provide quoted market prices of the securities  as well as the lack of any correlation of these instruments to other observable market data  we valued these securities using a discounted cash flow methodology with the most significant input categorized as level significant inputs that went into the model were the credit quality of the issuer  the percentage and types of guarantees such as federal family

based on these inputs  discounts from par ranged from to with a weighted average discount across the portfolio of

r  share based payment  sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period  whereas  sfas no 
permitted companies to record forfeitures based on actual forfeitures  which was our historical policy under sfas no 
during the year ended december   we applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate of in determining the expense recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
upon review of our actual rate of forfeitures since the adoption of sfas no 
r  and in consideration of the reduction in force that took place during the fourth quarter of  we changed our estimated forfeiture rate for certain option grants in from to 
this change in estimate was recorded as a cumulative catch up adjustment of approximately  and as a reduction in stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  the fair value of each stock option we granted is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing models require the input of various subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
due to our initial public offering in december  we believe there is not adequate information on the volatility of our own shares 
as such  our estimated expected stock price volatility is based on a weighted average of our own historic volatility and the average volatility of other similar companies in the same industry 
we believe this is more reflective and a better indicator of the expected future volatility  than using an average of a comparable market index or of a comparable company in the same industry 
our expected term of options granted since adoption of sfas no 
r was derived from the short cut method described in sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
we consider relevant evidence  positive and negative  to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years 
we account for uncertain tax positions under the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fas  accounting for income taxes  fin  which we adopted effective january  fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 

table of contents we generally report tax positions in our financial statements as they are reported on tax returns as filed or expected to be filed 
a tax benefit is reflected in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that we will be able to sustain the tax position  based on its technical merits 
tax benefits from uncertain tax positions that reduce current or future income tax liabilities are reported in the financial statements only to the extent each benefit is recognized and measured  in accordance with the provisions of fin recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no

 business combinations 
this statement retains the fundamental requirements in statement that the acquisition method of accounting which statement called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
this statement defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control 
statement did not define the acquirer  although it included guidance on identifying the acquirer  as does this statement 
this statement s scope is broader than that of statement  which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration 
by applying the same method of accounting the acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses  this statement improves the comparability of the information about business combinations provided in financial reports 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities to enable investors to better understand a company s use of derivative instruments and their effect on a company s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
this statement is effective for us beginning on january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of money market funds  state and municipal government obligations  some of which are auction rate securities  commercial paper  federal agency notes and corporate obligations 
the securities  other than money market funds and auction rate securities  are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
all investments other than auction rate securities mature by january  these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold our fixed income investments until maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio in available for sale debt securities 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows in thousands and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
december  thereafter investments at fair value weighted average interest rate 
table of contents we hold investments in auction rate securities or ars with underlying assets that generally consist of student loans  which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed  with one exception 
to date we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ars when due and expects to continue to do so in the future 
during the year ended december   certain investments in arss were successfully called at full par value and we received cash proceeds of approximately million 
in january  an additional million in cash proceeds was received by us related to certain investments in ars that were successfully called at full par value 
during the year ended december   we adjusted the carrying amount of our ars to estimated fair market value 
if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue and these markets deteriorate further or we experience any additional rating downgrades on any investments in its portfolio  we may incur further temporary impairments or other than temporary impairments  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings 
as discussed further in liquidity and capital resources  in november we agreed to accept auction rate security rights  or the rights  from ubs financial services inc  which permit us to sell  or put  our auction rate securities back to ubs at par value at any time during the period from june  and july  associated with the rights  we classified million of our ars from available for sale securities to trading securities as of december  and recognized a loss of million in loss gain on investments  reflecting a reversal of the related temporary valuation allowance that was previously recorded within accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in shareholders equity 
we elected to measure the value of the rights under the fair value option of fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and recorded a gain of million in loss gain on investments  and a corresponding non current asset 
we expect that the future changes in the fair value of the ars will be mostly offset by the fair value movements in the related rights 
foreign currency exchange 
a significant portion of our operations is conducted through operations in countries other than the united states 
revenues from our international operations that were recorded in us dollars represented approximately of our total international revenues during the year ended december  substantially all of the remainder of our revenues was from sales in euros  british pounds  japanese yen and chinese yuan renminbi 
since we conduct our business in us dollars  our main exposure  if any  results from changes in the exchange rate between these currencies and the us dollar 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
our policy is to reduce exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by having most of our assets and liabilities  as well as most of our revenues and expenditures  in us dollars  or us dollar linked 
therefore  we believe that the potential loss that would result from an increase or decrease in the exchange rate is immaterial to our business and net assets
