overview the purpose of this discussion is to focus on important factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to assist in the evaluation of our performance 
analysis of operating results net income we reported net income of  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the basic and diluted earnings per share were both 
the basic and diluted earnings per share were and for december   and and  respectively  for the year ended december  two important and commonly used measures of profitability are return on assets net income as a percentage of average total assets and return on shareholders equity net income as a percentage of average common shareholders equity 
our returns on average assets were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the returns on average shareholders equity were  and for the same time periods 
net income was down in compared to  or and net income declined  or in compared to net interest income declined in or  compared to  which had increased  or over provision for loan losses increased or  in compared to  which had increased or  over non interest income increased  or in compared to and  or in compared to these trends represent a combination of factors which include a severe downturn in the economy  low interest rates  and prudent management decisions with regard to asset management and deployment 
non interest expenses increased or  for a total of  in and  or for a total of  compared to  in the majority of the increases were in salaries and benefits  occupancy expenses and loan origination expenses 
the net effect on pre tax income was a decrease of or  to  compared to which had a pre tax income decrease of  or  to  when compared to  in net non interest income  which represents non interest income minus non interest expense  improved dramatically in with the growth of our non interest income lines of business 
a lower net non interest income number will typically lead to greater profitability  and we focus more closely on this number than on the industry standard efficiency ratio 
in  our net non interest loss was  compared to  in  a improvement 
in this number grew  or when compared to  in due to the expansion of our mortgage and banking operations 
net interest income net interest income  our primary source of revenue  is the excess of interest income over interest expense 
net interest income is influenced by a number of factors  including the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rates earned on earning assets  and the interest rates paid to obtain funding to support the assets 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to recognize the income tax savings on tax exempt assets  such as bank owned life insurance boli and municipal securities and loans 
a tax rate of was used in adjusting interest on boli  tax exempt securities and loans to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets with an adjustment made to tax exempt income to provide comparability with taxable income  ie the fte adjustment and the cost of the supporting funds is measured by the net interest margin 
net interest income declined  to  in compared to  in net interest income growth in was  or over we have an asset sensitive balance sheet with the majority of our earning assets set to reprice within a one year time frame and many of our loans repricing on a daily basis based on market indexes 
when comparing the components of net interest income in to the numbers indicate that our total interest costs increased  or to  on average volume growth of million while total interest income increased  or to  on average volume growth of million 
the same comparison in to shows that our total interest costs only increased  or to  on average volume growth of million while total interest income declined  or to  on average volume growth of million 
as stated previously we are asset sensitive and the current economic environment has created challenges in that began in late a majority of the loan portfolio is tied to the wall street journal prime rate which has moved in tandem with the changes in the federal funds rate 
the federal reserve open market committee  which sets the federal funds rate  decreased the target funds rate five times in for a total of basis points which has resulted the historically low federal funds rate of 
in they decreased rates three times for a total of basis points between september and december 
interest earning assets repriced more rapidly than interest bearing deposits which represent of total interest bearing liabilities  creating a timing difference between declines in interest earnings and cost 
table depicts interest income on average earning assets and related yields  as well as interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and related rates paid for the periods indicated 
our net yield on earning assets or net interest margin  which is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets  was in compared to and in and  respectively 
our earning asset yield decreased basis points in to compared to a basis point increase to in over the rate of 
during the same periods liability costs declined basis points to compared to a basis point increase to in over in the result of these changes is a basis point margin compression in to a spread of compared to in and in comparing the basis point decrease in our earning asset yield to the decrease in the index reveals that we have been able to soften the effect of the economic change through management strategies 
with of all loans repricing due to maturity or contractual repricing to the prime rate or another market index in and in  we have negotiated floors on the majority of our commercial and mortgage loan portfolio which prevented further declines in asset earnings 
on the cost side  we have promoted funding growth that is short term  with of interest bearing liabilities set to reprice within the next twelve months 
these strategies should enable us to react more quickly to index changes going forward 
table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense  and distinguishes between the changes related to increases or decreases in average outstanding balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities volume  and the changes related to increases or decreases in average interest rates on such assets and liabilities rate 
comparing the rate and volume of the periods presented further points to the impact that rate had on our performance 
as indicated by table  in net rate changes took million from income and net growth could only replace million for a decline of million in net interest income 
the majority of the rate impact was on loan yields where rate decreases reduced interest income million and growth could only replace million for a net loss of million 
on the other hand  the decrease in rates helped lessen the impact that deposit growth had on cost 
the overall decline in other borrowings was due more to rate than volume 
comparing to  when net interest income increased million  loan growth improved earnings million while rate contributed thousand 
deposit growth increased cost million and rate added another thousand 
other borrowings also were impacted by both rate and growth for additional cost

the portion of change in relating to both rate and volume is allocated to each of the rate and volume changes based on the relative change in each caterogy 
the following table analyzes the changes in both rate and volume components of net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis

our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
our primary objectives for managing interest rate volatility is to identify opportunities to maximize net interest income while ensuring adequate liquidity and carefully managing interest rate risk 
the asset liability management committee alco  which is composed of executive officers  is responsible for monitoring corporate financial performance  meeting liquidity requirements  establishing interest rate parameters  indices  and terms for loan and deposit products  assessing and evaluating the competitive rate environment  monitoring and measuring interest rate risk 
interest rate risk refers to the exposure of our earnings and market value of portfolio equity mve to changes in interest rates 
the magnitude of the change in earnings and mve resulting from interest rate changes is impacted by the time remaining to maturity on fixed rate obligations  the contractual ability to adjust rates prior to maturity  competition  and the general level of interest rates and customer actions 
there are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on our earnings and capital 
repricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities 
reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower or higher rates 
basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally 
yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  alco reviews the changes in net interest income and mve given various changes in interest rates 
we also consider the most likely interest rate scenarios  local economics  liquidity needs  business strategies  and other factors in determining the appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  simulation analysis is used to determine the impact on net interest income and mve from changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the amount of assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice through specified periods if there are no changes in balance sheet mix 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis in table reflects our assets and liabilities on december  that will either be repriced in accordance with market rates  mature or are estimated to mature early or prepay within the periods indicated in thousands 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of our position at any other time 
interest bearing demand deposits and money market balances are considered interest sensitive for of the outstanding balances 
management believes this structure makes for a more accurate and meaningful view of our interest sensitivity position 
as illustrated in the table  monarch is asset sensitive  primarily due to its adjustable rate loan portfolio 
the majority of these loans is indexed to the wall street journal prime rate and can adjust either daily or monthly 
to match this  we have also kept the maturities of most of our borrowings short  either maturing or repricing within one month 
table interest rate sensitivity analysis december  months or less months to year year to years years to years years total interest sensitive assets interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold securities loans bank owned life insurance total interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities now and savings deposits money market deposits time deposits other borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities interest sensitivity gap    cumulative interest sensitivity gap percentage cumulative gap to total interest sensitive assets because of inherent limitations in interest rate sensitivity analysis  alco uses more sophisticated interest rate risk measurement techniques 
simulation analysis is used to subject the current repricing conditions to rising and falling interest rates in increments and decrements of  and to determine how net interest income changes for the next twelve months 
alco also measures the effects of changes in interest rates on mve by discounting future cash flows of deposits and loans using new rates at which deposits and loans would be made to similar depositors and borrowers 
market value changes in the investment portfolio are estimated by discounting future cash flows and using duration analysis 
loan and investment security prepayments are estimated using current market information 
table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates up and down  and on net interest income and on mve as of december  in thousands 
the projected changes in net interest income to changes in interest rates at december  were in compliance with established guidelines for increases and decreases in rate of but were not in compliance for changes of and 
the projected changes in mve to changes in interest rates at december   were in compliance with established policy guidelines for increases and decreases in rate of and  as well as  decreases in rate of 
however  the project changes in income were not in compliance for a decrease in rate of 
these projected changes in the mve model are based on numerous assumptions of growth and changes in the mix of assets or liabilities 
the positive gap in the interest rate sensitivity analysis indicates that our net interest income would rise if rates increase and fall if rates decline 
the simulation analysis presents a more accurate picture since certain rate indices that affect liabilities do not change with the same magnitude over the same period of time as changes in the prime rate or other indices that reprice loans and investment securities 
the projected changes in net interest income at december  were in compliance with established policy guidelines 
we continue to focus on compliance through the tightening of lending guidelines and the establishment of floors for certain products 
table change in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity change in interest rates changes in changes in market value net interest income of portfolio equity amount percent amount percent up up up down down down our simulation model makes assumptions including the slope and timing of rate increases  the rates that drive certain financial instruments  prepayment assumption  etc

non interest income non interest income totaled  in  an increase of  or over  which was  or higher than the following table lists the major components of non interest income for december   and december  mortgage banking income investment and insurance commissions service charges and fees security losses  net loss on sale of other real estate  net bank owned life insurance income title company income gain on sale of assets  net gain on early extinguishment of debt other mortgage banking income represents fees from originating and selling residential mortgage loans as well as commercial mortgages through monarch mortgage and our subsidiary  monarch capital  llc

they closed  loans in compared to in and in the dollar volume closed in was  compared to  in and  in net interim interest income on loans closed but unfunded is shown as a component of mortgage banking income in all years presented 
investment and insurance commissions showed some increase in a difficult year for investment activity 
income in was significantly higher than because of the formation in late of virginia asset group  llc vag a owned subsidiary of our wholly owned subsidiary  monarch investments  llc 
vag has been a top producer for the past two years for the broker dealer in which monarch investments  llc  has ownership 
a gain on acquisition of infinex financial  llc equity has been recorded in due to the merger of the broker dealer  bi investments  llc  into infinex financial  llc 
following this merger  monarch investment  llc  owns a interest in infinex financial  llc 
service charges continued to grow with deposits 
the fees charged in connection with our overdraft nsf program  which allows retail clients to overdraw their accounts without the negative stigma associated with a returned check  also increased 
this program was initiated in with broad customer acceptance 
as noted above  the primary reason for the increase was deposit growth coupled with our overdraft nsf program  which began in service charge pricing on deposit accounts is typically reevaluated annually to reflect current costs and competition 
net security losses in were related primarily to the sale of a poorly performing security in the fourth quarter which carried a loss of  gains related to rate calls on discounted securities totaled  in securities losses of  in were due to the sale of lower yielding investment securities 
in management sold lower yielding mortgage backed securities 
in we sold three foreclosed properties for a net loss of  there were no gains or losses to report in either or is the first year we have had foreclosed properties 
title income increased notably in due to our newly formed title company  real estate security agency  llc 
our wholly owned subsidiary  monarch investment  llc  owns of this new company with owned by titleventures  llc 
prior year s income was from our minority interest in bankers title of central virginia  llc  a joint venture with the virginia bankers association and many other community banks in virginia which we sold in in october we purchased  in bank owned life insurance that has resulted in income and commissions in each of the three years presented 
in the company entered into a sale leaseback agreement on its lynnhaven banking office that resulted in a total gain of  in compliance with gaap   of that gain was deferred and is being amortized over the life of the lease 
the reportable gain has been included in non interest income for in other income included a one time gain from early repayment on a federal home loan bank borrowing in the amount of  other income represents a variety of nominal recurring and non recurring activities and transactions that have occurred throughout the year 
non interest expense non interest expense for was  compared to  and  for and  respectively 
the following table lists the major components of non interest expense for december   and year ended december  salaries and employee benefits occupancy expenses loan origination expenses furniture and equipment expense data processing services professional fees telephone stationary and supplies marketing expense virginia franchise tax regulatory assessment atm expense postage amortization of intangible assets other expenses that had the highest dollar increase year over year are broken out by dollar increase and percentage change below 
year ended december  vs 
vs dollars percentage dollars percentage salaries and employee benefits loan origination expenses occupancy expenses furniture and equipment expense telephone regulatory assessment postage in all periods presented  the majority of the increase in expense growth was due to increased staffing and higher benefits costs 
represents a full year of salary expense related to our expansion in mortgage operations as well as increases related to two additional banking offices  additional lenders and support staffing which has more than doubled the number of our employees 
at december   we employed a total of full and part time employees compared to and at year end and  respectively 
in addition  higher production related incentives  and higher health insurance costs and other benefits such as social security taxes  medicare taxes  and k contribution expenses have contributed to the increase 
the expansion of our mortgage operations has been the major contributor to the growth in loan expense 
costs associated with underwriting and processing mortgage loans at our current volume are significant 
bank related loan expense has also increased due to higher loan volume 
additionally  expense related to the shipping of mortgage loan packages to secondary market investors has had an impact on postage 
occupancy plus furniture and fixture expense have increased as a result of expansion 
we currently have twenty seven offices  the majority of which we lease 
this compares with twenty office locations in and thirteen in our industry requires that our loan officers be mobile  but accessible to their clients 
the telephone is a necessary tool in their daily communication 
the growth noted earlier is attributable to both the increase in the number of employees and our volume growth 
the current state of the economy has had a direct impact on our regulatory assessment 
the number of bank failures in the past eighteen months has decreased deposit insurance reserves 
as such the remaining banks must bear the burden of restoring these reserves through the payment of assessments 
the federal deposit insurance commission has had to increase their assessments rates in both and  resulting in a significantly higher expense in both years 
we continue to focus on controlling overhead expenses in relation to income growth 
the efficiency ratio  a productivity measure used to determine how well non interest expense is managed  was in  compared to in  and  in the bank only efficiency ratio was in  compared to in  and in a lower efficiency ratio indicates more favorable expense efficiency 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non interest expense by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and non interest income 
the expansion of our non interest income lines of business has negatively impacted this ratio 
income taxes the company recognized federal income tax expense of  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
during we recognized federal income tax expense of  resulting in an effective tax rate of and in we recognized federal income tax expense of  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the major difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate results from income that is not taxable for federal income tax purposes 
the primary non taxable income is that of state and municipal securities or loans and bank owned life insurance

our policy is to invest primarily in securities of the u 
s 
government and its agencies and in other high grade fixed income securities to minimize credit risk 
our securities portfolio plays a role in the management of interest rate sensitivity and generates additional interest income 
in addition  our portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and is used to meet collateral requirements 
our securities portfolio consists of two components  securities held to maturity and securities available for sale 
securities are classified as held to maturity based on our intent and ability  at the time of purchase  to hold such securities to maturity 
these securities are carried at amortized cost 
securities which may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in securities prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  general liquidity needs  and other similar factors are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value

loans  net of unearned income  increased  or during loans held for sale are loans originated for the secondary market by monarch mortgage that have closed but not funded increased or  to  on december  compared to  on december  this notable increase was due to a recent boom in the mortgage industry coupled with a full year under our restructured mortgage division model  monarch mortgage  which has resulted in a significant increase in both the number and dollar amount of loans originated monthly 
the discussion below excludes loans held for sale 
commercial loans and commercial loans secured by real estate should be considered together under the title of commercial when comparing loans outstanding in compared to prior years 
in may  we evaluated the classification of our loan portfolio as reported on march  with regard to underlying collateral 
based on that evaluation  loans previously classified as commercial were moved to commercial secured by real estate 
prior years presented have not been restated

note to monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k provides a schedule of loans by type and other information 
we do not participate in highly leveraged lending transactions  as defined by the regulators  and there are no loans of this nature recorded in the loan portfolio 
we do not have foreign loans in our portfolio

our management is responsible for determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  subject to review by the board of directors 
among other factors  this committee considers on a quarterly basis our historical loss experience  the size and composition of our loan portfolio  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  non performing credits including impaired loans and our risk rating based loan watch list  and national and local economic conditions 
the economy of our trade area is well diversified 
there are additional risks of future loan losses that cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
since those factors include general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses is an estimate 
the sum of these elements is our management s recommended level for the allowance 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is based on loss factors that cannot be associated with specific loans or loan categories 
these factors include management s subjective evaluation of such conditions as credit quality trends  collateral values  portfolio concentrations  specific industry conditions in the regional economy  regulatory examination results  external audit and loan review findings  recent loss experiences in particular portfolio segments  etc 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s attempt to ensure that the overall reserve appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of credit losses 
we developed a methodology to determine an allowance to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio based on evaluations of the collectability of loans  historical loss experience  peer bank loss experience  delinquency trends  economic conditions  portfolio composition  and specific loss estimates for loans considered substandard or doubtful 
all commercial and commercial real estate loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
based on management s evaluation  estimated loan loss allowances are assigned to the individual loans which present a greater risk of loan loss 
if necessary  reserves would be allocated to individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow 
any reserves for impaired loans are measured based on the present rate or fair value of the underlying collateral 
we evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
a composite allowance factor that considers our and other peer bank loss experience ratios  delinquency trends  economic conditions  and portfolio composition are applied to the total of commercial and commercial real estate loans not specifically evaluated 
the remaining loan loss allowance is allocated to the remaining loans on an overall portfolio basis based on industry and or historical loss experience 
the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies 
homogenous loans  such as consumer installment  residential mortgage loans  and home equity loans are not individually reviewed and are generally risk graded at the same levels 
the risk grade and reserves are established for each homogenous pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs from a current trend in delinquencies  losses or historical experience and general economic conditions 
in  we accrued  in provision for loan losses compared to  in based on the current economic environment and the composition of our loan portfolio  the level of our charged off loans combined with our peer bank loss experience  we considered it prudent to allocate additional funds to our loan loss allowance in the unfortunate side effect of this decision is a decrease in our earnings for the year ended december   because the additional allocation had to run through our income statement 
loans charged off during totaled  compared to  in and recoveries totaled  and  in and  respectively 
the ratio of net charge offs to average outstanding loans was in compared to in table presents our loan loss and recovery experience in thousands for the past five years 
the allowance for loan losses totaled  at december   an increase of over december  the ratio of the allowance to loans  less unearned income  was at december  and at december  the allowance to loans ratio is supported by the level of non performing loans  the seasoning of the loan portfolio  and the growing experience of the lending staff in the market 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb any inherent losses on existing loans in our loan portfolio at december  see note to monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k for more information concerning our loan loss and recovery experience

we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is available to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for losses and by recoveries from losses 
charged off loan balances are subtracted from the allowance 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined on a quarterly basis 
various factors as defined in the previous section allowance and provision for loan losses are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status after they are past due for days 
non performing loans include loans on which interest is no longer accrued  accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more as to principal and interest payments  and loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are detailed in table total non performing loans as a percentage of total loans were and at december  and december   respectively 
the majority of our non performing loans at december  are related to one secured relationship 
there were twenty three loans totaling  in non accrual status at december  and three loans at december  totaling  all of these loans have been identified as impaired according to financial accounting statement no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and later amended by financial accounting statement no

a loan is considered impaired if it is probable that the lender will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement

table deposits average balance average rate average balance average rate demand deposits non interest bearing now accounts money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit we are continually evaluating the mix of our deposit base time deposits versus demand  money market and savings in relation to our funding needs and current market conditions 
in we developed two higher yielding products in areas that have traditionally offered lower rates  an interest bearing demand account and savings account 
in response  interest bearing demand deposits increased million on average with an average rate increase of over and average savings deposits have increased million with average rate increase of 
non interest bearing demand deposits increased an average of million 
we are a participant in the federal deposit insurance transaction account guarantee program which provides that through december   our clients receive unlimited coverage for balances in their non interest bearing deposits 
stiff competition in the industry for money market accounts coupled with a level of migration to other products we offer have resulted in a million decline in average money market accounts 
in the third quarter of we ran a certificate of deposit campaign which brought in million in new money at a cost of to increase liquidity 
this campaign offered market competitive rates on shorter term certificates of deposits 
we continue to balance our yield on deposits by maintaining a level of out of market brokered products which allow for more flexibility in pricing and timing of maturities 
at december  our total brokered certificates of deposits to total deposits was compared to at december  certificates of deposit of  or more are detailed in table more information on deposits is contained in note to monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k 
table certificates of deposits certificates of deposit as of december  and in amounts of  or more were classified by maturity as follows in thousands december  combined core brokered combined core brokered months or less over through months over through months over months although brokered deposits are purchased in large denomination transactions  the source of these deposits is in denominations of less than  providing us with a balance of stability and flexibility 
in the fdic increased the level of insurance on interest bearing accounts to  until december  as of december   our non brokered deposits in excess of  totaled million 
liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through short term borrowings 
our liquidity is provided from cash and amounts due from banks  federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in other banks  repayments from loans  increases in deposits  lines of credit from the federal home loan bank and five correspondent banks  and maturing investments 
as a result of our management of liquid assets  and our ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  we believe that we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy our depositors requirements and to meet clients credit needs 
we also take into account any liquidity needs generated by off balance sheet transactions such as commitments to extend credit  commitments to purchase securities and standby letters of credit 
we monitor and plan our liquidity position for future periods 
liquidity strategies are implemented and monitored by our asset liability committee alco 
the committee uses a simulation and budget model to assess current and future liquidity needs 
cash  cash equivalents and federal funds sold totaled million as of december   down  from the year ended december  at december   cash  securities classified as available for sale and federal funds sold were million or of total earning assets  compared to million or of total earning assets at december  we have additional sources of liquidity available to us including the capacity to borrow additional funds through several established arrangements 
further information on borrowings is contained in note to monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k 
in the course of operations  due to fluctuations in loan and deposit levels  we occasionally find it necessary to purchase federal funds on a short term basis 
we maintain unsecured federal funds line arrangements with five other banks  which allow us to purchase funds totaling  these lines mature and reprice daily 
at both december  and  we had  and  respectively  in fed funds purchased 
we also have access to the federal reserve bank of richmond s discount window should a liquidity crisis occur 
we have not used this facility in the past and consider it a backup source of funds 
we are a member of the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and as such  may borrow funds under a line of credit based on criteria established by the fhlb 
this line of credit would allow us to borrow up to of assets  or approximately  if collateralized  as of december  we currently pledge loans and investment securities to secure this line 
blanket liens pledged on certain designated loan portfolios amounted to million at december  and million at december  additionally  investment securities with carrying values of thousand at december  and million at december  were pledged to secure any borrowings 
based on pledged collateral we had a line of million at december  this line was reduced by million  which has been pledged as collateral for public deposits 
should we ever desire to increase the line of credit beyond the limit  the fhlb would allow borrowings of up to of total assets once we met specific eligibility criteria 
we had  of fhlb borrowings outstanding on december  and  outstanding as of december  we had  in daily rate borrowings which reprice daily and  in three fixed term advance contracts outstanding on december  the first advance  which was used to match fund several amortizing longer term fixed rate loans  matures on september  and bears interest of at december  the second advance matures on november   bears a fixed interest rate of 
the third advance matures on november   bears a fixed interest rate of and has a one time conversion feature that allows the fhlb the option of a one time conversion to a variable rate instrument on may  capital resources we review the adequacy of our capital on an ongoing basis with reference to the size  composition  and quality of our resources and consistent with regulatory requirements and industry standards 
we seek to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and absorb potential losses 
in december  we were approved for and received million from the us treasury department under the tarp capital purchase program 
under this program we issued  shares of series a   par value  cumulative perpetual preferred stock 
this stock will carry a dividend for each of the first years of the investment  and thereafter  unless we elect to redeem the shares 
these shares also carry certain warrants to on our common stock 
in june  we raised million net in capital through the sale of  shares of our common stock in two private placements 
selling shareholders were accredited investors and included certain qualifying insiders 
these insiders were members of our board of directors and senior management whose purchases were made in accordance with nasdaq capital market guidelines 
more information this issue is contained in note to monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k 
on july   we issued trust preferred subordinated notes in the amount of  through a private transaction 
these notes  which are non dilutive to common stock  may be included in tier i capital for regulatory capital determination purposes 
the notes have a libor indexed rate which adjusts  and is payable  quarterly 
the rate on the notes at december  was 
the notes may be redeemed at par beginning on september  this capital was used for general corporate purposes to support the continued growth 
on april   we announced an offering of a minimum of  shares and a maximum of  shares of common stock at a pre established price of per share 
the offering ran until may  with the full  shares sold 
the number of shares issued and outstanding increased to  from  with the completion of this offering 
this capital was used for general corporate purposes to support the continued growth 
the federal reserve  the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance bank have adopted capital guidelines to supplement the existing definitions of capital for regulatory purposes and to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically  the guidelines categorize assets and off balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
at december   the required minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets was  of which must be tier one capital 
tier capital includes stockholders equity  retained earnings and a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock  less certain goodwill items 
at december   our total risk based capital ratio was  which is well above the regulatory minimum of and the well capitalized minimum of 
further information on capital adequacy for the company may be found in note of monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k 
all share and per share amounts are retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock dividend and splits 
off balance sheet transactions we enter into certain financial transactions in the ordinary course of performing traditional banking services that result in off balance sheet transactions 
our off balance sheet transactions recognized as of december  were a line of credit to secure public funds  commitments to extent credit and standby letters of credit 
our line of credit to secure public funds was from the federal home loan bank 
this line was for million at december  and commitments to extend credit and unfunded commitments under existing lines of credit amounted to million at december  and million at december   which represent legally binding agreements to lend to clients with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being funded  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue guaranteeing the performance of a client to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements 
at december  and december   we had million and million respectively  in outstanding standby letters of credit 
we do not have any off balance sheet subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
there were no commitments to purchase securities at december  or december  we and our subsidiaries have twenty one non cancellable leases for premises

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  business combinations  which replaces sfas  business combinations 
this statement establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree as well as the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of sfas r on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment to arb no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest  and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas also establishes expanded disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent s owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning december  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of sfas on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in february   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting for transfers of financial assets and repurchase financing transactions fsp 
fsp requires that an initial transfer of a financial asset and a repurchase financing that was entered into contemporaneously with  or in contemplation of  the initial transfer be evaluated together as a linked transaction under sfas  unless certain criteria are met 
fsp is effective for the company s financial statements for the year beginning on january  and earlier adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of fas will not have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company adopted the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings sab for loan commitments measured at fair value through earnings which were issued or modified since adoption 
sab requires that the expected net future cash flows related to servicing of a loan be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings 
the adoption of sab generally has resulted in higher fair values being recorded upon initial recognition of derivative interest rate lock commitments 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of sfas the standard requires enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and hedged items that are accounted for under sfas and related interpretations 
the standard will be effective for periods beginning after november   with early adoption permitted 
the standard expands the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedged items and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
on october   the fasb issued fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
the fsp clarifies the application of sfas  fair value measurements  in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
the fsp is effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
the provisions of fsp fas did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those applications of accounting principles or practices that require considerable judgment  estimation  or sensitivity analysis by management 
in the financial service industry  examples  though not an all inclusive list  of disclosures that may fall within this definition are the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of mortgage servicing rights  valuation of derivatives or securities without a readily determinable market value  and the valuation of the fair value of intangibles and goodwill 
except for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and fair value estimations  we do not believe there are other practices or policies that require significant sensitivity analysis  judgments  or estimations 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
our critical accounting policies are listed below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they have a probability of occurring and are estimable and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses along with various economic factors and  as a result  could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since this history is updated with the most recent loss information  the errors that might otherwise occur are mitigated 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified loans 
historical loss information  expected cash flows and fair market value of collateral are used to estimate these losses 
the unallocated allowance captures losses whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowance 
the use of these values is inherently subjective  and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
fair value measurements on january  we adopted sfas  fair value measurements  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the estimation of fair value is significant to certain assets  including loans held for sale  available for sale securities  rate lock commitments  and real estate owned 
these assets are recorded at fair value or lower of cost or fair value  as applicable 
the fair values of loans held for sale are based on commitments from investors 
the fair values of available for sale securities are based on published market rates or dealer quotes 
the fair values of rate lock commitments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements  and may consider the difference between current interest rates and committed rates 
the fair value of real estate owned is estimated based on our evaluation of fair value of similar properties 
fair values can be volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  and market conditions  among others 
since these factors can change significantly and rapidly  fair values are difficult to predict and subject to material changes that could impact our financial condition and results of operation 
non gaap presentations our management s discussion and analysis refers to the efficiency ratio  which is computed by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income 
this is a non gaap financial measure which we believe provides investors with important information regarding our operational efficiency 
comparison of our efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible because other companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently 
in referring to our net income  we are referring to income under generally accepted accounting principals  or gaap 
the analysis of net interest income in this document is performed on a tax equivalent basis 
we feel the tax equivalent presentation better reflects total return  as many financial assets have specific tax advantages that modify their effective yields 
a reconcilement of tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income under generally accepted accounting principals  or gaap  is provided in those statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets 
due to this fact  the effects of inflation on our balance sheet are minimal  meaning that there are no substantial increases or decreases in net purchasing power over time 
the most significant effect of inflation is on other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
we feel that the most significant impact on financial results is changes in interest rates and our ability to react to those changes 
as discussed previously  management is attempting to measure  monitor and control interest rate risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by our board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
our board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to our asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  our alco committee develops guidelines and strategies that govern our asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with our financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of our earnings 
our alco committee uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while our alco committee routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling twelve month horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on our balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times during each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to our alco committee policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a  and basis point bp upward or downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following reflects the range of our net interest income sensitivity analysis and market value of portfolio equity sensitivity as of december  all except the basis point increase of the market value of portfolio equity sensitivity results met the approved policy limits of our asset liability management policy 
the basis point shifts in the net interest income sensitivity results were within the approved limits 
we continue to focus its efforts on complying with approved limits 
table change in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity change in interest rates changes in net interest income changes in market value of portfolio equity amount percent amount percent up up up down down down our simulation model makes assumptions including the slope and timing of rate increases  the rates that drive certain financial instruments  prepayment assumption  etc 
represents the difference between estimated net interest income for the next months in the current rate environment 
represents the difference between market value of portfolio equity in the current interest rate environment 
at the end of  our interest rate risk model indicated that in a rising rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could increase by on average 
for the same time period the interest rate risk model indicated that in a declining rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could decrease by on average 
while these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is very balanced with little risk to rising rates in the future 
in our balance sheet grew by million 
deposit inflows  primarily in the form of short term certificates of deposits have provided the funding for the growth in the loan portfolio 
overall  we continue to have moderate interest rate risks to both falling and rising interest rates 
based upon final simulation  we could expect an average positive impact to net interest income of  over the next months if rates rise basis points 
if rates were to decline basis points  the company could expect an average negative impact to net interest income of  over the next months 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a bank forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flow 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on clients with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that our alco committee might take in response to or anticipation of changes in interest rates
