the company s target audiences within the investment related periodical publications field are individual investors  colleges  libraries  and investment management professionals 
individuals come to value line for complete research in one package 
institutional subscribers  such as libraries and universities  offer the company s detailed research to their patrons and students 
investment management professionals use the research and historical information in their day to day businesses 
depending upon the product  the company offers three months or less  annual  or multi year subscriptions 
generally  all subscriptions are paid for in advance of fulfillment 
renewal orders for the retail market are solicited primarily through a series of efforts that include letters  email  and telemarketing 
new orders are generated primarily from targeted direct mail campaigns for specific products 
other sales channels used by the company include advertising in media publications  the internet  cross selling via telesales efforts and internet promotions through third parties 
institutional subscribers consist of investment management companies  colleges  and libraries 
the company has a dedicated department that solicits institutional subscriptions 
fees for institutional services are based on university or college enrollment or number of users for corporate and library subscribers 
cash received for retail and institutional orders is recorded as unearned revenue until the order is fulfilled 
as the subscriptions are fulfilled  the company recognizes revenue in equal installments over the life of the particular subscription 
subscription revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the subscription 
accordingly  the amount of subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of the balance sheet is shown as unearned revenue within current and long term liabilities 
changes in unearned revenue generally indicate the trend for subscription revenues over the following year as the current portion of unearned revenue is expected to be recognized as revenue within months 
the company s businesses consolidate into two business segments

results of operations the recession in the us was in full bloom at year end april   and the global economy continued to falter as well 
while the dow jones industrial average and s p index were up and respectively for the quarter ended april   they were down and respectively for the year then ended 
the severe downturn and volatility within the financial markets throughout the fiscal year has negatively impacted the company s assets under management and the assets attributable to third party copyright data partners 
this trend can be seen across the asset management industry 
according to the investment company institute ici  the combined assets of the mutual funds in the united states excluding money market funds declined by trillion or for the twelve months ended april  although we have not suffered a fundamental change in our business model  the collateral damage from the global economic decline significantly reduced our assets under management and related investment management and copyright data revenues 
in response we have been diligent about continuing our expense control and have taken initiatives to reduce costs 
the company continues to be debt free with substantial liquidity sufficient to endure the current economic crisis in terms of anticipated liquidity needs 
the following table illustrates the key earnings figures for each of the past three years ended april    and key earnings figures year ended april  percentage change in thousands  except earnings per share vs vs earnings per share net income operating income income from securities transactions  net for the twelve months ended april  the company s net income of  or per share was  or below net income of  or per share for the twelve months ended april  operating income of  for the twelve months ended april  was  or below operating income of  last fiscal year 
the sharp decline in operating income was partially offset by company s income from securities transactions  which at  for the twelve months ended april   was  or above last year s level of  due to the sale of the equity portfolio in the second quarter of fiscal year the company redeployed the proceeds from the equity portfolio into short term fixed income investments or cash equivalents and does not anticipate significant income from securities transactions this year 
shareholders equity of  at april  was lower than shareholders equity of  at april  the decline in our earnings occurred primarily during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year ended april  as the economy and financial markets declined 
net income for the third quarter ended january  was  or less than the net income of  for the third quarter ended january  net income for the fourth quarter ended april  was  or less than the net income of  for the fourth quarter ended april  operating revenues  which consist of investment periodicals  and related publications revenues  copyright data fees  and investment management fees and services  all declined for the twelve months ended april  operating revenues and of total by year year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs investment periodicals and related publications copyright data fees investment management fees and services total operating revenues investment periodicals and related publications revenues investment periodicals and related publications revenues were down  or for the twelve months ended april  as compared to the twelve months of the prior fiscal year 
while the company continues to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels  primarily direct mail and the internet  total product line circulation continues to decline 
factors that have contributed to the decline in the investment periodicals and related publications revenues include competition in the form of free or low cost investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no cost to their clients 
as of the end of april   total company wide circulation has dropped more than compared to the previous year end  and is down from two years ago 
overall renewal rates for the flagship value line investment survey are  down from a year earlier 
the company is not adding enough new subscribers to offset the subscribers that choose not to renew 
the recession and turmoil in the markets have increased the decline in subscriptions as individuals reduced many forms of discretionary spending  or have shifted investments to fixed income  for which the company does not provide research 
the company has been fortunate that electronic investment periodicals revenues have increased  from the previous year  but the increase does not offset the lost print revenue of  fiscal year institutional sales through april were in excess of million  up million from the previous fiscal year  and the month of march was the best month in the company s history for institutional print and electronic publications with approximately million in new and renewal sales 
within investment periodicals and related publications are subscription revenues derived from print and electronic products 
the following chart illustrates the year to year change in the revenues associated with print and electronic subscriptions 
subscription revenues year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs print publication revenues electronic publication revenues total investment periodicals and related publications revenue unearned revenues short and long term for the twelve months ended april  print publication revenues decreased  or below last fiscal year for the reasons described above 
print circulation  which has always dominated our subscription base  has fallen from two years earlier 
electronic publications revenues grew by  or for the twelve months ended april  and by for the twelve months ended april  with the exception of the value line investment survey online edition  all other retail electronic services have seen declines in circulation from two years ago 
the electronic publication revenues are broken down into institutional accounts and retail subscribers 
for the twelve months ended april   institutional revenues increased  or  while revenues from retail subscribers were down  or as compared to the twelve months ended april  the company has successfully expanded its institutional sales marketing efforts  and the increase in institutional revenues is a direct result of a focused effort to boost sales to colleges  libraries and money managers 
the decrease in electronic retail publications revenues is primarily attributable to the decrease in circulation within the company s software products 
circulation of the value line investment analyzer decreased  which resulted in a  decline in revenues from this product 
in march  the company released its version of this product 
the company has received mixed results from subscribers to the product and as of june  has not seen any change in the negative circulation trend for this product 
the value line timeliness ranking systemtm the ranking system has historically been one of the key components in the company s flagship product  the value line investment survey  and is also the foundation on which much of the company s copyright data business is derived 
unfortunately  in the volatile market of the past year  the ranking system has not performed up to historical standards 
although it has gone through brief periods of underperformance before  the rapid and severe price actions in the markets appear to have favored short term investing  as investors buy well known names whose earnings have plunged but whose stock prices are cheap  hoping the stock prices will rebound 
such stocks are generally not well ranked by value line because the ranking system emphasizes earnings results and price momentum 
the ranking system is designed to be predictive over a six to month period 
over the year ended june   the ranking system results were in perfect reverse order  with the rank stocks lowest ranks rebounding quickly after being beaten down most of last year  to outperform the rank   and stocks 
if the market remains as volatile in the coming year as it was last year  or if fundamental market factors result in longer term deterioration of the ranking system s predictive performance  the company believes the ranking system may continue to struggle 
this may negatively impact subscription revenues and copyright data fees 
the company and its quantitative research staff are working to improve the ranking system s predictive performance although no assurances are possible 
copyright data fees copyright data fees have decreased  or for the twelve months ended april  as compared to the twelve months ended april  as of april   total third party sponsored assets are attributable to four contracts for copyright data and represent billion in various products as compared to three contracts and billion in assets last fiscal year  representing an almost decline in assets year over year 
the combination of the underperformance by the ranking system and the broad and deep declines throughout the equity markets have significantly impacted assets of the third party sponsors that are customers of our copyright data business and have resulted in lower asset based fees paid to the company 
the company is in discussion with new sponsors in an effort to increase revenues in this area 
however  although no agreements were terminated in fiscal year  only one new agreement has been signed 
the company believes the growth of the business is dependent upon the desire of third party marketers to use the value line proprietary research and other proprietary information for their products  and the marketplace s acceptance of new products 
today this market is significantly more competitive as a result of product diversification and growth of the use of indexes by portfolio managers 
the copyright data of the value line ranking system and other proprietary information have been a critical component of the company s plan to replace the shrinking publishing revenues 
unless the ranking system s predictive performance improves  we anticipate copyright data revenues will underperform the previous year s revenues from that source 
investment management fees and distribution services revenues the financial markets have experienced unprecedented volatility and declines over the past year 
equity indexes such as the djia  nasdaq  and s p are down   and respectively for the year ended april  such market depreciation  a decline in shareholder accounts and net shareholder redemptions have resulted in a contraction in total assets within the value line funds of as compared to a year ago 
the following tables illustrate the total fund assets as of april  as compared to the previous two years

as a result of the decline in assets under management occurring over the course of the year  investment management fees and distribution services revenues for the twelve months ended april  were  or below the prior fiscal year 
management fees for the fiscal year were down  or as compared to fiscal year there was a net decrease of  or in distribution services revenues b fees 
during the period  contractual fee waivers have existed for most of the value line funds 
for the twelve months ended april  and  b fee waivers were  and  respectively 
for the twelve months ended april  and  management fee waivers were  and  respectively 
twelve of the fourteen funds have a portion of or the full amount of the b fees being waived and five of the fourteen funds have partial management fee waivers in place 
with very limited exception  the company and its subsidiaries have no right to recoup the previously waived management fees and b fees 
separately managed accounts revenues decreased  or for the twelve months ended april  as compared to the twelve months ended april  primarily due to market decline in the portfolios 
at the march  meeting of the board of directors for the value line funds  the advisory and distribution agreements were continued for another year 
of the funds managed by the company  shares of value line strategic asset management trust sam and value line centurion fund are available to the public only through the purchase of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by the guardian insurance annuity company  inc giac

the equity funds had net redemptions for the year ended april   as compared to net sales the previous year 
shareholder accounts for the year ended april  declined to  from  for the previous year  representing a decline 
the largest distribution channel for the value line funds remains the fund supermarket platforms such as charles schwab co  inc the company has received inquiries from various platforms concerning the sec investigation described in the contingencies footnote the company believes the accounts that are held at fund supermarkets may be vulnerable based on poor performance and concerns about the sec investigation  as investment advisors or prospects may choose to redeem existing investments or not make further investments 
the value line fixed income mutual fund assets excluding the value line cash fund  represent of total mutual fund assets at april  and are down from the previous year 
value line cash fund assets represent of the total fund assets at april  and have decreased from the previous year  primarily since the company and its parent redeployed cash into other fixed income investments such as pre refunded bonds and us treasuries 
shareholder transactions for the value line mutual funds are processed each business day by the third party transfer agent of the funds 
shares can be redeemed without advance notice upon request of the shareowners each day that the new york stock exchange is open 
since the close of the fourth quarter and as of this filing  the financial markets continue to be volatile  but the markets have slightly improved 
the company s separately managed accounts as of year end april  have million in assets  down from million and million respectively at april  and april  of the million  million is affiliated with the parent 
assets within the separately managed accounts are held at third party custodians  are subject to the terms of each advisory agreement and do not have any advance notice requirement for withdrawals  although they have a day advance notice requirement for termination of the account 
as of april  the company lost a million account from the new york state common retirement fund as their five year contract expired and was not renewed based on a reallocation of investments by the state 
the company did not add any new accounts during the fiscal year 
expenses expenses within the company are categorized into advertising and promotion  salaries and employee benefits  production and distribution  and office and administration 
operating expenses of  for the twelve months ended april  were  or below operating expenses of  last fiscal year 
advertising and promotion year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs advertising and promotion advertising and promotion expenses for the twelve months ended april  decreased  as compared to the comparable twelve months ended april  within the investment management segment  supermarket and guardian giac platform expenses associated with the distribution of the mutual funds decreased  or below the prior year due to the decline in assets under management 
in fiscal  the company reduced print advertising promoting the mutual funds due to the volatility in the marketplace 
for the twelve months ended april   media advertising decreased  from the twelve months ended april  within the publishing segment  costs associated with direct mail decreased  or below last fiscal year  due to increased efficiency in the selection of direct mail lists and a reduction in the overall number of pieces mailed year to year 
for the twelve months ended april   internet marketing costs increased  or compared to the twelve months ended april  salaries and employee benefits year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs salaries and employee benefits over the past several years  the company has saved money by combining the roles and responsibilities of various personnel and by selective outsourcing 
some duplication of effort has been eliminated and certain tasks  such as some data entry  have been outsourced to third party vendors that the company believes can provide better controls and results at a favorable cost 
salaries and employee benefits decreased by  from the previous year  primarily due to the company s decision to not contribute to the value line profit sharing plan for fiscal year  which was partially offset by cost of living increases in july to the staff 
production and distribution year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs production and distribution production and distribution expenses for the twelve months ended april  were  below expenses for the twelve months ended april  amortized software costs decreased  below last fiscal year due to a reduction in prior year expenditures for capitalized costs 
in addition  the decline in expenses was due to volume reductions in paper  printing and mailing that resulted primarily from a decrease in circulation of the print products 
partially offsetting the savings during the twelve months ended april  was a  increase in the costs of data feeds  an increase in postage rates  and an approximate increase in the cost of paper during fiscal year  as paper mills closed  keeping prices up 
the company continues to seek purchasing alternatives  more economical delivery methods for the products  and additional ways to reduce the costs of production and distribution 
office and administration year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs office and administration office and administration expenses for the twelve months ended april  were  above expenses for the twelve months ended april  professional fees significantly increased as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of the sec investigation

as previously mentioned  sub par ranking system performance and competition in the form of free or low cost investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no cost to their clients contributed to the decline in revenue 
the recession and turmoil in the markets have also contributed to the decline in subscriptions as individuals reduced many forms of discretionary spending  or have shifted investments to fixed income  for which the company does not provide research 
investment periodicals  publishing copyright data segment profit margin from operations decreased as a direct result of the decline in revenue 
investment management segment revenues  operating profit and operating profit margins from the company s investment management business segment declined significantly from the previous fiscal year primarily due to the decline in investment management fees from the company s family of mutual funds that was a direct result of the deterioration in the underlying assets under management 
the decline in assets under management was primarily the result of the impact by the economic recession and declining equity markets  sub par ranking system performance  and the weak performance of the value line funds and may also be attributable in part to the impact of the sec investigation 
income from securities transactions  net during the twelve months ended april  the company s income from securities transactions  net  of  was  higher than income from securities transactions  net  of  during the twelve months ended april  income from securities transactions  net  includes dividend and interest income of  at april  that was  below income of  for the twelve months ended april  capital gains  net of capital losses during the twelve months ended april   were  which included a realized capital gain of  from the sale of equity securities within the company s portfolio 
capital gains  net of capital losses during the comparable twelve months of fiscal  were  of which  represented distributions from the value line mutual funds 
liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of  as of april  and  as of april  cash and short term securities were  as of april  and  as of april  the company s cash and cash equivalents includes  at april  which is invested in the value line cash fund 
the cash fund operates under rule a of the investment company act of and has a portfolio average maturity of under days 
the company s cash fund also participates in the treasury guarantee program for money market funds through september  there have been no delays in redemption payments from this fund 
the fund s portfolio primarily includes us government agency securities  us treasuries  certificate of deposits fully backed by the fdic  and repurchase agreements collateralized with us treasuries in which the custodian physically takes possession of the collateral 
cash from operating activities the company s cash flow from operations of  for the twelve months ended april  was below cash flow from operations of  for the twelve months ended april  the primary change was the timing of purchases and maturity of fixed income securities within the company s trading portfolio  a decline in the company s unearned revenue  a decline in advisory fees receivable  reduction in accrued benefits  and the timing of payments to vendors 
cash from investing activities the company s cash inflow from investing activities was  for the twelve months ended april  compared to cash outflow from investing activities of  for the twelve months ended april  the significant increase in cash inflows is a result of proceeds from the liquidation of sales in the equity portfolio and the maturity of fixed income securities during the twelve months of the fiscal year a portion of these proceeds were redeployed into fixed income government debt securities during the fiscal year 
cash from financing activities the company s net cash outflow from financing activities of  represents a quarterly dividend of 
per share paid in may for the dividend declared during the last quarter of fiscal and 
per share paid for the last three quarters of fiscal at the july board meeting  the board approved a quarterly dividend of 
per share  an increase of 
per share or 
at the april board meeting  the board approved a reduced quarterly dividend of 
per share 
therefore  fiscal net cash outflow from financing activities representing dividends paid was higher than cash outflow from financing activities of  in the prior fiscal year 
management believes that the company s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with the future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted liquidity needs including operations 
management does not anticipate any borrowing in fiscal critical accounting estimates and policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent and the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition income taxes revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenues come from the sale of print and electronic subscriptions  investment management and service and distribution fees  and copyright proprietary information 
the company recognizes subscription revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription  which generally ranges from three months to one year or longer  varying based on the product or service 
investment management fees and service and distribution fee revenues for the value line funds are recognized each month based upon the daily net asset value of each fund 
copyright data fees are calculated monthly based on market fluctuation and billed quarterly 
the company believes that the estimates related to revenue recognition are critical accounting estimates  and to the extent that there are material differences between its determination of revenues and actual results  its financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
income taxes the company s effective annual income tax expense rate is based on the us federal and state and local jurisdiction tax rates on income and losses that are part of its consolidated financial statements 
tax planning opportunities and the blend of business income and income from securities transactions will impact the effective tax rate in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in its consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s tax return the company s cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as non taxable income that is not includable in the company s tax return and expenses that are not deductible in the company s tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation and amortization expenses 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as of april   the company had  of deferred tax assets  which included  of short term deferred tax assets 
in assessing the company s deferred state and city tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets the company determines a lesser allowance is required  the company would record a reduction to the income tax expense and to the valuation allowance in the period this determination was made 
this would cause the company s income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
in addition  the company establishes reserves at the time that it determines that it is more likely than not that it will need to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
the company adjusts these reserves  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the company has established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
such liabilities are recorded as income taxes payable in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which the company has previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to the company s income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations below is a summary of certain contractual obligations in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations reflected on balance sheet total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks 
the company s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity prices 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with the company s business activities 
interest rate risk the company s strategy has been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk 
despite this strategy management recognizes and accepts the possibility that losses may occur 
to limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes  the company s management invests primarily in short term obligations maturing in less than years 
the fair values of the company s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  and other general market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table

equity price risk the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold
