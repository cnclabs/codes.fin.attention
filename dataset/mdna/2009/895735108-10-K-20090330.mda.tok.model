overview thanks to the acquisition of producing properties  tvog s reserves are increasing while demand for petroleum products increases 
while the trend until the fourth quarter global financial meltdown for demand to outstrip available supplies is worldwide as well as national  we believe that it is particularly acute in california  our primary venue for exploration and production  which imports nearly of its oil and nearly of its natural gas demand 
oil prices tend to be set largely by national state oil companies based on supply and demand  while natural gas prices seem to be more dependent on local conditions 
we expect that gas prices will hold steady or possibly increase over this year 
if  however  prices should fall  for instance due to new regulatory measures or the discovery of new and easily producible reserves or a terrorist attack that would reduce flying and traveling to create a temporary glut from reduced fuel use  our revenue from oil and gas sales would also fall 
the aforementioned global economic meltdown has already negatively impacted oil prices in the second half of and so far in in we created a limited partnership called the opus i 
the purpose of this partnership is to raise one hundred million dollars by selling partnership interests 
for the year ended december   opus i partnership raised million for drilling and development and spent million primarily on the drilling of seven more horizontal wells on the pleasant valley leases in the oxnard oil field and infrastructure expansion and facilities 
in addition opus spent million on the purchase of steam generators and heater treaters for their pleasant valley leases  and million on additional operations 
at the end of  with the acquisition of pleasant valley  temblor valley and moffat ranch east on behalf of the partnership  it was determined to end the raising of funds for the remainder of exploration plays in favor of capitalizing development of the properties to build production and revenue to achieve a high multiple return to opus investors rather than continue further exploration risk for the opus i partners 
a new partnership is envisioned for further exploration 
we continue grading and prioritizing our proprietary geologic library  which contains over california leads and prospects  for exploratory drilling 
we use our library and our seismic database and other geoscientific data to decide where we should seek oil and gas leases for future exploration 
from this library we were able to put together many of the prospects currently in opus i 
of course  we cannot be sure that any future prospect can be obtained at an attractive lease price or that any exploration efforts would result in a commercially successful well 
we believe that we have acquired an inventory of under explored under exploited properties with the potential to yield a multiple return on investment with further development 
we believe our existing inventory of projects bears a high enough ratio of potentially successful to unsuccessful projects to deliver value to our drilling partners and our shareholders from successful wells  in excess of the total costs of all successful and unsuccessful projects 
our future results will depend on our success in finding new reserves and commercial production  and there can be no assurance what revenue we can ultimately expect from any new discoveries 
we do not engage in hedging activities and do not use commodity futures or forward contracts for cash management functions 
critical accounting policies we prepare consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this report in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report contains a comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgment due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements under gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and some narrative disclosures 
the estimates that are most critical to our consolidated financial statements involve oil and gas reserves and impairment of oil and gas properties 
oil and gas reserves 
estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines and were based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers with respect to our properties 
the accuracy of a reserve report estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
it should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows included in this report as of december  is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we have based the estimated present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and cost may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
changes in oil and gas prices can cause revisions in our estimates if the sales price on which reserves are based makes it uneconomic to continue producing the reserves based on our current production costs 
in  and our average and year end price received for natural gas was significantly higher than our average production costs  and it appears unlikely that natural gas prices would fall far enough to result in an impairment based on historic prices 
however  a significant fall in the price of oil in caused a reduction in our oil reserves and resulted in recording an impairment expense as discussed below 
because of the impairment of oil reserves to a value of  no further reduction is possible 
estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of its oil and gas producing properties for impairment 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
we review our long lived proved properties  consisting of oil and gas reserves  at least annually and record impairments to those properties  whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment by depletable field pool  which is the lowest level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated 
management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon its outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties 
we determine that a property is impaired when prices being paid for oil or gas make it no longer profitable to drill on  or to continue production on  that property 
a dramatic price decrease in oil and gas prices during the second half of required the company to impair reserves and record an impairment expense of  for the year for proved properties  this impairment does not include impairment of rig assets during of million 
price increases in the prior three years did reduce the instances where impairment of reserves appeared to be required  however  we did record impairment expense of  in   in and  in as a result of reducing potential future recoverable reserves 
the impairment expense for was related to proved oil and gas properties 
these assets are expected to remain impaired 
we do not currently expect the changes in the price of natural gas would result in impairment of our gas properties because our production costs are significantly less than historic market prices for gas 
however  if natural gas prices  in northern california  fall below our historic production costs of to per mcf  more of our proved developed reserves could become impaired  which would reduce our estimates of future revenue  our proved reserve estimates and our profitability 
other significant accounting policies successful efforts method of accounting we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method 
in general  we believe that  during periods of active exploration  net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method 
the critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method of accounting is as follows under the successful efforts method  exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur  whereas  under the full cost method of accounting  such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets  pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense 
stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
r to account for our stock option plan beginning january  this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the modified prospective method was selected as described in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under this method  we recognize stock option compensation expense as if we had applied the fair value method to account for unvested stock options from the original effective date 
stock option compensation expense is recognized from the date of grant to the vesting date 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses the following assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is based on historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the securities and exchange commission issued sab providing for a safe harbor in calculating the expected life using the contractual life of the option one  divided by two 
the company used this methodology for valuing the stock option grants issued during  the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on us treasury rates in effect at the time of grant 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
we maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which result from net operating losses and statutory depletion carryforwards from prior years 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes as interpreted by fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  requires that the company continually assess both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset can be realized prior to their expiration 
considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not 
additionally  our federal and state income tax returns are generally not filed before the financial statements are prepared 
therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each calendar year as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and tax credit carry forwards 
due to uncertainties involved with tax matters  the future effective tax rate may vary significantly from the estimated current year effective tax rate 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an uncertain tax position is required to meet before tax benefits associated with such uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements 
as of december   the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that it will not realize its gross deferred tax asset position after giving consideration to relevant facts and circumstances 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to monitor company specific  oil and gas industry economic factors and will reassess the likelihood that the company s net operating loss and statutory depletion carryforwards will be utilized prior to their expiration 
commitments and contingencies 
we make judgments and estimates regarding possible liabilities for litigation and environmental remediation on a quarterly basis 
management s judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisers  and the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators or courts of the law 
we have no ongoing litigation or environmental remediation 
we routinely have clean up and maintenance obligations in connection with oil and gas drilling and production activities  but we have never had a material environmental liability or claim 
actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons 
environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws and regulations  additional information obtained relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 
in accordance with sfas no  accounting for contingencies  a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimated 
a change in estimate could impact our oil and gas operating costs and the liability  if applicable  recorded on our balance sheet
