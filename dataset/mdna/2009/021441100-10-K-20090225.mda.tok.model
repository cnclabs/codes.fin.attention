table of contents part i item business founded in  altera corporation is a leading supplier of programmable semiconductors and related products that enable electronic systems companies to rapidly and cost effectively innovate and differentiate in their markets 
our headquarters facility is located at innovation drive  san jose  california  and our website is www

our common stock trades on the nasdaq global market under the symbol altr 
altera designs  manufactures  and markets a variety of products programmable logic devices plds  which consist of field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds  are standard semiconductor integrated circuits  or chips  that our customers program to perform desired logic functions in their electronic systems 
hardcopy application specific integrated circuits asics transition customer designs from high density fpgas to low cost non programmable implementations for volume production 
because they are customized only on the last few mask layers  hardcopy asics deliver performance that can be an alternative to traditional asics  but with reduced development costs and shorter production lead times 
pre defined design building blocks  known as intellectual property ip cores  can be licensed by customers to add standard functions to their pld designs 
customers develop  compile  and verify their designs  and then program their designs into our plds using our proprietary development software  which operates on personal computers and engineering workstations 

table of contents we were one of the first suppliers of complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos plds and are currently a global leader in this market 
our broad range of plds offer unique features as well as differing densities and performance specifications  and serve a wide range of customers within the communications  computer and storage  consumer  and industrial market segments 
an overview of typical pld applications within these markets is shown in the table below 
market segment market sub segment application product communications networking routers switches wireline access systems metropolitan area networks optical networks wireless cellular basestations wireless local area networks lans computer and storage computer mainframes servers office automation copiers multi function peripherals printers storage redundant array of inexpensive disks raid systems storage area networks sans consumer broadcast broadcasting equipment studio editing equipment satellite equipment entertainment cable set top boxes flat panel televisions industrial automotive car entertainment systems navigation systems medical medical imaging diagnostic systems patient monitoring systems military guidance and control systems radar systems secure communications systems test measurement communications test equipment oscilloscopes semiconductor test equipment other card readers energy management systems manufacturing equipment surveillance systems digital logic overview most electronic systems use three types of digital integrated circuits processors  which include microprocessors  microcontrollers  and digital signal processors  control central computing tasks and signal processing 
memory stores programming instructions and data 
logic manages the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system 

table of contents system designers typically use some standard architectures to meet their processor and memory needs  but need a wide variety of logic circuits to differentiate their end products 
most applications use one or more of the following types of logic in their designs asics often referred to as standard cells  asics are manufactured with custom designs created by the customer 
as a result  each asic has a fixed function used by a single customer in a single application 
application specific standard products assps assps are standard devices that usually cannot be customized by the end user 
in contrast to an asic  which is built for a single customer  an assp is built for a specific type of application targeted to a small number of customers 
assps are sometimes described as asics developed for multiple customers 
plds unlike asics and assps  plds are standard products that can be customized for a wide range of applications 
as a result  plds are typically sold to hundreds or thousands of customers 
this flexibility offers many advantages  including simple design changes  shorter design cycles  and lower development costs 
in a broad sense  these products compete with each other as they may be used in the same types of applications in electronic systems 
however  differences in cost  performance  density  flexibility  ease of use  and time to market dictate how much they directly compete for particular applications 
the table below summarizes key characteristics of asics  assps  and plds 
asic assp pld customizable yes  by chip fabrication facility no yes  by end user erasability reprogrammability no no yes relative time to market slow immediate fast relative unit cost low moderate moderate to high customer s development cost high low moderate field upgradability no no yes plds vs 
asics in contrast to asics  pld designs are programmed directly into the pld 
this means that the pld is fully functional and verified when the design is completed  avoiding the lengthy and complex cycles required to verify and fabricate asics 
this user programmability allows pld customers to test and revise their designs quickly and with minimal development cost 
in addition to these ease of use and time to market advantages  plds can be upgraded in the field  which allows customers to modify the pld design after the electronic system has been shipped 
these advantages  however  come at a cost 
programmability requires a larger die size  which typically translates into a higher per unit cost when compared to asics 
as a result  unit volume for plds is typically lower than for asics 
asics offer more optimized chip performance and lower per unit costs than plds  which means that they are generally viewed as a more cost effective option for large volume  low cost applications such as consumer electronics 
however  they require high up front costs for design  verification  and mask development  known as non recurring engineering nre costs  that make sense only for very high volumes 
nre costs for asics can range from the hundreds of thousands to multi million dollar costs 
some customers prototype with plds for their time to market benefits and then redesign to an asic to reduce costs as volume increases 
while redesigns have always been part of the pld business  we believe that three trends increasingly drive customers to use plds for their systems entire life cycle lower price premiums for plds compared to asics shorter life cycles of many electronic systems increased failure risk and higher nre costs of asics 
table of contents plds vs 
assps customers use assps when they need specific fixed functions with little differentiation  for example when implementing certain electronic industry standards 
however  assps have fixed functionality  which limits the range of applications they can address 
in contrast to assps  pld flexibility allows customers to define functionality to suit their needs  rather than restrict their system architecture based on assp manufacturer specifications 
furthermore  pld designers can add ip design blocks to execute standardized functions otherwise performed by assps 
technology evolution benefits plds as chip manufacturing technology becomes more advanced  the total cost of chip development increases  reducing the cost advantage of asics and assps 
the cost and time for us to develop a pld is comparable to developing an asic or assp  but since each of our plds is sold to hundreds or thousands of customers  our development costs are spread across a wide customer base 
in contrast  asic and assp suppliers build fixed custom chips for a single customer or application 
because it is increasingly difficult to identify opportunities that generate enough revenue to compensate for the high development costs  asic suppliers may impose higher up front costs and minimum order quantities on customers  and assp manufacturers may choose to develop fewer products 
some asic and assp suppliers may also choose to use non leading edge process technology for new designs to reduce costs 
for most current designs  pld process technology is typically two or three process generations more advanced than asic and assp process technology 
while using lagging process technology helps reduce asic development cost  it also lessens the asic device cost and performance advantage relative to a pld developed on a more advanced process technology 
the process technology gap between plds and asic and assp alternatives will increase over time and may drive the further adoption of plds 
strategy and competition we believe that the increasing cost of advanced chip manufacturing technology drives the development and use of standard programmable digital integrated circuits 
as with microprocessors and memory  plds provide the flexibility for the customer to define and change circuits without incurring the cost  risk  and delays of custom chip fabrication 
consequently  we believe that  despite their higher per unit cost  customers will increasingly use plds not only for prototyping  but also for production quantities rather than asics or assps 
to capture a larger share of the chips purchased by our customers  we focus on providing the most advanced programmable solutions plds with the speed  density  low power consumption  functionality  and package types to meet customer needs plds optimized for low cost and high volume applications hardcopy asics to enable our customers to move easily from our largest plds to a low cost asic optimized  pre verified system level ip cores to speed the design process state of the art development tools that offer low cost  ease of use  and compatibility with other industry standard electronic design automation eda tools a complete customer support system we believe that our greatest growth opportunity is displacing asics and assps 
as a result  our strategy in recent years has not only been to add more prototyping customers  but more importantly  to use cost optimized products to increase our penetration into high volume applications and end markets 
pld vendors have innovated and used the most advanced process technology to rapidly reduce pld cost structure and power consumption while increasing device speed and density 
this makes programmable logic an increasingly competitive alternative to asics and assps and will increase the use of plds 
we compete with other pld vendors to realize this opportunity and for market share within the pld market 
using publicly available data and information obtained from gartner dataquest  we estimate that two vendors altera and 
table of contents xilinx  inc account for of the total pld market 
the smaller vendors  including lattice semiconductor corporation and actel corporation  together represent approximately of the pld market 
two distinct sub segments of the pld market  cplds and fpgas  comprise the majority of revenues but  due to product differences  usually do not compete directly for the same customer designs 
the fpga market has outgrown the cpld market over the last several years 
fpgas now cover approximately of total pld sales  and are expected to continue to be the fastest growing segment of the pld market 
based on our estimates  we believe that our share of the fpga market increased from in to in  and that maintaining or increasing our fpga market share is important to our long term growth 
competition among pld vendors is most intense in the design win phase of the customer s design  when customers select products for use in their systems 
because each vendor s products are proprietary  the cost to switch plds after a system has been designed and prototyped is very high 
therefore  customers rarely switch pld vendors after the initial selection for a particular design 
from the time a design win is secured  it can be two or more years before the customer starts volume purchases of our devices 
typically  the customer selects the pld vendor relatively early in the design process  but it may take several years to complete system design  build prototypes  sample the marketplace for customer acceptance  make modifications  and manufacture in volume 
thus  there is a delay between developing a competitive advantage to a shift in pld market share  meaning that market share is a lagging indicator of relative competitive strength 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the success or timing of a customer s product  and because the end markets are so fragmented we have over  pld customers  it is difficult even for pld vendors to gauge their competitive strength in winning designs at a particular point in time 
principal competitive factors in the pld market include technical innovation device performance  power consumption  and features capability and productivity of software development tools and ip cores pricing and availability quality and reliability technical service and customer support manufacturing and operational competence customer familiarity with existing vendors and entrenched products we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our proprietary device architecture and installed base of software development systems provides some competitive advantage 
because of unique architectural innovation and advanced technologies  our new product families provide greater functionality and lower power consumption at a lower price for any given density compared to their predecessors 
we also believe that our new product families compete favorably against asics and assps  as well as against other types of chips such as microcontrollers  microprocessors  and digital signal processors 
designers can add some of the functionality of these other chips to plds using pre built and pre verified ip cores 
an ip core is typically offered in either a hard or soft form 
a hard ip core is embedded into the actual circuitry of our chips 
a soft ip core is a licensed design file that our customers incorporate into their design and program onto the pld 
by incorporating more functionality and logic capacity on a programmable chip while providing the necessary design tools and ip cores to design a reliable system  we believe we can enhance the advantages of plds over competing solutions 
as is true of the semiconductor industry as a whole  the digital logic segment and the pld sub segment are intensely competitive  and each successive product generation is characterized by rapid technological change and price decline 
all of these factors may adversely affect our future operating results 
for a discussion of risk factors associated with our strategy and competition  see item a risk factors our failure to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry would adversely affect our financial results and business prospects and our failure to define  develop  and manufacture technologically advanced products would adversely affect the success and growth of our company 

table of contents products our products consist primarily of devices  ip cores  and proprietary development tools 
a brief overview of these products follows 
devices our devices fall into the following four categories  spanning multiple architectures and families with numerous product options fpgas cplds low cost hardcopy asics configuration devices that store the programming code for our fpgas our percentage of sales by product category is as follows product fpgas cplds other products includes hardcopy asics  configuration devices  ip cores  and development tools each device family has unique functional benefits and different density and performance specifications 
some of our latest device families  typically designed into new equipment  are summarized and described below 
while our more mature device families still contribute significantly to our total revenue  they are generally not designed into our customers products today  so their descriptions have been omitted for brevity 
stratix iii and stratix iv high end  system level fpgas our stratix product families are built using advanced cmos process technology and address a broad range of applications in the communications  computing and storage  consumer  and industrial markets 
stratix fpgas provide high logic density and performance and low power consumption  while offering high speed and flexible embedded system functionality such as memory and digital signal processing dsp blocks 
additionally  our stratix iv gx fpgas offer advanced transceiver capabilities for applications that require reliable  multi gigabit data transfer rates 
our stratix iv series fpgas are built using advanced nm process technology 
cyclone ii and cyclone iii low cost  high volume fpgas our cyclone product families are built using advanced cmos process technology and bring programmable flexibility to cost sensitive applications across an array of communications  computing and storage  consumer  and industrial markets 
our cyclone iii family uses low power process technology to meet market requirements for low power consumption 
architectural innovation allows cyclone fpgas to combine a low cost structure with abundant device resources  making them ideal for high volume applications across all our markets in areas such as digital set top boxes  dvd player recorder systems  automotive telematics  flat panel televisions  military applications and wireless communications equipment 
arria gx low cost  transceiver equipped fpgas our arria product family is built using advanced cmos process technology and enables a simplified transceiver based design for applications requiring high performance data transfer protocols 
arria gx fpgas offer best in class signal integrity  providing designers a risk free solution for next generation high bandwidth systems in the communications  storage  computer  and industrial markets 
max ii cplds our max families are instant on  non volatile cplds used in high speed glue logic functions for a broad range of electronics equipment in the communications  computing and storage  consumer  and industrial markets 
glue logic 
table of contents permits multiple subsystem components to interact 
our max ii cplds have a revolutionary architecture that reduces costs by or more  consumes less power  and increases performance by as much as over the previous generation max family 
for the most demanding low power and battery operated portable applications  our max iiz cplds offer microamp standby current in ultra small chip packaging 
hardcopy asics our hardcopy asics offer customers a migration path from the highest density fpga families to a low cost asic for high volume production 
for a given process technology  hardcopy asics deliver nearly the performance of comparable cell based asics  but with reduced development costs and shorter production lead times 
in contrast to traditional cell based asics  in which every mask layer is custom and unique to the customer s design  our hardcopy asics share a common set of base layers so only the last few mask layers are customized to implement the customer s design 
by removing the configuration circuitry  programmable routing  and programmability for logic and memory  we reduce the die size and therefore device cost  but deliver functionality  performance and power characteristics that are equivalent or more favorable to that of an fpga 
as a result  customers get the flexibility and time to market advantages of a high density fpga during the prototyping and early production phases  and then seamlessly convert the design to a hardcopy asic for high volume 
this allows hardcopy asics to be used in high volume cost sensitive applications historically served by traditional cell based asics 
intellectual property cores ip cores are pre verified building blocks that execute standard system level functions 
customers integrate ip cores in their pld designs with our proprietary development software 
soft ip cores available for use in our devices include our nios series of embedded processors  our portfolio of megacore functions that we license to our customers  and our altera megafunction partners program ampp sm cores  which are pre verified by us and licensed to our customers by third parties 
the nios series of embedded processors use a reduced instruction set computing risc architecture and can be efficiently used in our fpgas as a cost competitive and flexible alternative to discrete microcontroller solutions 
the nios series of embedded processors compete favorably with many discrete microcontrollers 
with ip cores  system designers can focus more time and energy on improving and differentiating the unique aspects of their system designs  rather than spending time designing common off the shelf functions 
ip cores are essential to providing solutions with higher levels of integration and faster time to market 
today  we offer a broad range of soft ip cores for dsp algorithms  bus interfaces  memory controllers  telecommunications  data communications  microprocessors  and peripherals 
before licensing a soft ip core  customers can download an encrypted soft ip core from our website and verify that it works in their own system designs 
while licensing soft ip cores represents a small portion of our total revenues  we believe a broad product offering in this area is necessary to compete with asic and assp vendors as well as other pld vendors 
development tools to enhance engineering productivity  customers use our proprietary development tools  consisting primarily of the quartus ii software  for design entry  design compilation  design verification  and device programming 
designers can use our development tools on a variety of computing platforms including microsoft windows  unix including solaris and hp ux  and linux operating environments with built in interfaces to many industry standard eda tools offered by cadence design systems  inc  mentor graphics corporation  synopsys  inc  and others 
like ip cores  our development tools generate less than of our total revenues  but are a critical and necessary element of our product portfolio because they are used to program our devices and can drive our success in competing for design wins against pld  asic  and assp vendors 
research and development our research and development activities focus primarily on plds  ip cores  development software  and hardware 
we develop these related products in parallel to provide comprehensive design support to customers 
as a result of our 
table of contents research and development efforts  we introduced a number of new families during recent years  including the stratix iv  stratix iv gx  stratix iii  stratix ii  stratix ii gx  cyclone iii  cyclone ii  arria gx  max iiz  max ii  hardcopy iv  hardcopy iii  and hardcopy ii device families  as well as major enhancements to our ip core offerings and the quartus ii development platform 
our research and development costs  which are charged to expense as incurred  were million in  million in  and million in we intend to continue investing in research and development to develop and achieve market acceptance of our new products 
for a discussion of risk factors associated with our research and development efforts  see item a risk factors our failure to define  develop  and manufacture technologically advanced products would adversely affect the success and growth of our company 
patents  trademarks  and licenses we rely on intellectual property law including patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in products and technology  and have increased our investment in intellectual property protection in the last several years 
activities include patents as of december   we owned more than  united states and foreign patents 
we also had more than  patent applications currently pending worldwide 
trademarks we use  register  and apply to register certain trademarks and service marks to distinguish our products  technologies  and services from those of our competitors in the united states and foreign countries 
product registrations we file registrations in the united states under the semiconductor chip protection act to protect our chip designs 
when appropriate  we file lawsuits to protect our intellectual property rights 
we have also licensed technology that allows us to design  manufacture  and sell products using certain intellectual property owned by others 
although we believe that protection afforded by our intellectual property rights has value  the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor industry makes our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills  technological expertise  and management abilities of our employees rather than on our patent  trademark  or other proprietary rights 
for a discussion of risk factors associated with our patents  trademarks  and licenses  see item a risk factors the failure of our intellectual property rights to provide meaningful protection from our competitors could harm our competitive position and intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products 
marketing and sales we market our products worldwide through a network of distributors  independent sales representatives  and direct sales personnel 
we add or remove independent sales representatives or distributors from our selling organization as we deem appropriate 
altera distributors in all of the major geographic markets that we serve  we work with distributors to provide demand creation for the broad customer base and order fulfillment services for most of our customers 
these distributors are franchised by component manufacturers to sell a wide variety of products to many customers  and they may sell competing products or solutions 
we have contracts with our distributors that can be terminated by either party upon notice 
all of our distributors stock inventory of our products 
distributors purchase products from us at a set distributor cost denominated in us dollars 
title and risk of loss transfer upon shipment from our stocking locations  which are located in the asia pacific region at the independent subcontractors we employ for test and assembly services or at our warehouse in san jose 
when products are shipped to a distributor  we defer revenue on the sale until the distributor sells the products in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
consequently  the deferred revenue and the corresponding deferred cost of sales are recorded as a current liability under the caption deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors 
all payments to us are denominated in us dollars 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policy  see note significant accounting policies revenue recognition to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our sales cycle begins with a design win phase  which can be lengthy and often requires the ongoing participation of sales  engineering  and managerial personnel 
once customer demand has been created and a design is ready to move to prototyping or production  the order fulfillment process begins 
whether altera  an independent sales representative  or the distributor created the demand  a local distributor will process and fulfill over of all customer orders 
our distributors are the legal sellers of the products and therefore bear all risks related to the sale of commercial goods  such as credit loss  inventory shrinkage and theft  and foreign currency fluctuations 
our distributors periodically return certain amounts of unsold product and receive price concessions for unsold product if we reduce prices 
for high volume or competitive situations  we often provide price concessions to our distributors 
typically  a customer purchasing a small quantity of product from a distributor will pay list price 
however  a customer using our products in volume production  purchasing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of units  will often negotiate a substantial price discount from the distributor 
under these circumstances  the distributor will often negotiate and receive a price concession from altera 
these price concessions are negotiated in us dollars 
average aggregate price concessions paid typically range from to of our list price on an annual basis  depending upon the composition of our sales  volume and factors associated with timing 
this is a standard practice in the semiconductor industry  and we provide some level of price concession to every distributor 
total sales are the sum of our own direct sales to oems and our distributors resale of altera products

the failure of our distributors to perform as expected would materially reduce our future sales and conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and distributors may impact their business operations and thereby adversely interrupt our manufacturing and sales processes 
see also note significant accounting policies concentrations of credit risk  significant customers and key suppliers to our consolidated financial statements 
altera sales  marketing  and customer support altera has a dedicated global sales and marketing organization to create customer demand and manage our network of distributors and independent sales representatives 
we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited number of key accounts  and provide technical  business  and marketing support to distributors and independent sales representatives 
independent sales representatives  who are mostly located in north america and in select european countries  create demand and provide customer support in a defined territory and often with a defined set of customers 
they do not stock inventory or fulfill orders 
all of our contracts with independent sales representatives can be terminated by either party upon notice 
customer support and service are important to selling and marketing our products 
we provide several levels of technical support  including application assistance  design services  and customer training 
we also publish data sheets and application notes  conduct technical seminars  and provide design assistance to the customer via the internet and electronic links 
we have domestic sales offices in numerous major metropolitan areas throughout the united states  and maintain international sales support offices in bangalore  beijing  cork  chengdu  helsinki  hong kong  london  munich  osaka  ottawa  paris  seoul  shanghai  shenzhen  singapore  stockholm  taipei  tokyo  and turin

see note segment and geographic information to our consolidated financial statements for information on the geographic breakdown of our property and equipment 
backlog our backlog consists mostly of distributor orders  as well as limited oem orders  that are for delivery within the next three months 
our backlog of orders on december   was approximately million  compared to million on december  historically  backlog is a poor predictor of future sales or customer demand for several reasons while our backlog increases during periods of high demand and supply constraints  purchasers may cancel product orders up to days before the scheduled delivery date without incurring significant cancellation penalties 
we defer revenue recognition on distributor shipments until the product is resold 
our backlog is valued at list price  which in most cases is substantially higher than the actual price 
manufacturing wafer supply die  cut from silicon wafers  are the essential components of all our devices and a significant portion of the total device cost 
our manufacturing strategy is known as a fabless business model since we purchase our silicon wafers from independent semiconductor foundries instead of manufacturing them ourselves 
this strategy allows us to take advantage of these suppliers economies of scale and gives us direct and timely access to advanced process technology 
we purchase nearly all of our silicon wafers from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  an independent semiconductor foundry 
we have no formalized long term supply or allocation commitments from tsmc 
in the past  we have used other foundry vendors  and we may establish additional foundry relationships as they become economically beneficial or technically necessary 
for a discussion of risk factors associated with our wafer supply arrangements  see item a risk factors we depend entirely on independent subcontractors to supply us with finished silicon wafers 
the failure of these subcontractors to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business  wafer shortages and or increased wafer and assembly material costs could lower our gross margins  reduce our sales  or otherwise materially disrupt our business  product manufacturing is complex  and our foundries may not achieve the necessary yields or product reliability that our business requires  and conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and distributors may impact their business operations and thereby adversely interrupt our manufacturing and sales processes 
testing and assembly after wafer manufacturing is completed  each silicon wafer is tested using a variety of test and handling equipment that is owned by us and consigned to our partners 
the vast majority of our silicon wafer testing is performed at tsmc or our san jose pilot line facility  which is used primarily for new product development 
the wafers are then shipped to various assembly suppliers in asia  where they are divided into good die and encapsulated in packages 
we use a number of independent assembly suppliers to take advantage of their economies of scale and supply flexibility  and to give us direct and timely access to advanced packaging technology 
we purchase almost all of our assembly services from amkor electronics  inc  in korea and the philippines  and advanced semiconductor engineering  inc ase in malaysia and taiwan 

table of contents following assembly  each packaged unit completes final testing  marking  and inspection before being packaged for storage as finished goods 
we also use amkor and ase for almost all of our final test and back end operation services 
these suppliers perform final testing using our proprietary test software operating on hardware that is consigned to or owned by our suppliers 
the majority of our inventory  including finished goods  is warehoused in asia at our subcontract test and assembly partners with a smaller portion located at our corporate facility in san jose  california 
these suppliers also ship our products to oems and distributors

risk factors 
the following risk factors  among others that are not presently known or that we currently believe unimportant  could affect our future results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements 
before you decide to buy  hold  or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider these risks  in addition to the other information contained in this report 
our business  financial condition  and operations results could be seriously harmed if any of the events described here actually occurs 
in that situation  the market price for our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions and the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor companies  such as altera  experience significant fluctuations in sales and profitability 
the semiconductor industry has experienced economic downturns and business contractions from time to time  such as the current downturn 
downturns in the semiconductor industry can be severe and prolonged 
these downturns can result in significant reductions in product demand  excess customer inventories and accelerated erosion of prices resulting from intensified competitive pricing dynamics 
in recent months  general worldwide economic conditions have significantly deteriorated due to credit conditions resulting from the recent financial crisis 
it is difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities in this economic environment 
we have experienced a recent slowdown in orders for our products and that trend could persist 
our ability to predict the quantity and type of products our customers will need in the future is challenging because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management 
these factors could affect the timing of customer orders and the overall level of demand for our products 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the success or timing of a customer s product  and because the end markets are so fragmented we have over  pld customers  our ability to forecast end customer demand is difficult 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell as quickly as estimated  if at all 
as a result we could hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  the tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our distributors or their customers original equipment manufacturers or subcontract manufacturers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations  which could affect demand for our products 
our operating cash flows are highly dependent on the continued collection of receivables and the ability to sell inventories 
continued declines in overall economic conditions could lead to deterioration in the quality of our receivables 
in addition to reductions in sales and elevated risk associated with the collection of receivables  our profitability and cash flows may suffer during downturns because we may not be able to reduce costs at the same rate as our sales decline 
as further described below  we depend entirely on independent subcontractors to supply us with finished silicon wafers and to assemble  test and ship our semiconductor products 
the tightening of global credit markets may adversely affect the ability of our suppliers to obtain financing for operations 
if our subcontractors capital structures weaken  they may fail to satisfy our demand and our business could be materially disrupted 
if global economic and market conditions remain uncertain or persist  spread or deteriorate further  we could experience a material impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our gross margins are subject to fluctuations due to many factors 
our gross margins may fluctuate due to many factors  including product mix market acceptance of our new products competitive pricing dynamics geographic and or market segment pricing strategies 
table of contents changes in the mix of our prototyping and production based business various manufacturing cost variables including product yields  wafer prices  package and assembly costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  and absorption of manufacturing overhead additionally  since the majority of our sales are booked and shipped through our distributors within the same quarter  forecasting our gross margins is difficult 
our failure to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry would adversely affect our financial results and business prospects 
the semiconductor industry  including the pld market  is intensely competitive 
our ability to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry depends on our ability to provide our customers with solutions providing greater value than those offered by competing programmable logic vendors  such as xilinx and lattice  and other semiconductor companies that indirectly compete with us 
because we develop plds for applications that are presently served by asic  assp  microcontroller  and digital signal processing dsp vendors  we indirectly compete against these vendors 
many of these vendors  including international business machines corporation ibm and texas instruments inc  have substantially more financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do and have well established market positions and solutions that have proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades 
we may be unable to displace these vendors in the targeted applications and densities 
further  other programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be successful in securing market share from us 
in addition  some of our customers have historically used standard cell technologies to improve system integration in their systems  which may not only hinder our efforts to penetrate the markets for asics  assps  microcontrollers  and digital signal processors  but also displace our products in the applications that we presently serve 
the length of our design in and sales cycles could affect our ability to forecast future sales 
our sales depend on our products being designed into end customers products  and on those products being produced in volume 
our products are very complex  and the time from design in to volume production ranges from six months to three years or more 
from initial product design in to volume production  many factors can affect the timing and or sales volume 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in the competitive position of our technology  the competitiveness of our end customers products in the markets they serve  our customers financial stability  end customer program delays and cancellations  and our ability to ship products according to customer schedules 
our business is characterized by a general decline in semiconductor product selling prices that may materially and adversely affect our profitability 
the selling prices of our products have decreased over time 
we have attempted to offset the selling price decreases by reducing manufacturing costs  improving yields  and increasing unit sales 
however  our ongoing efforts may not be successful or may not keep pace with the anticipated  continued decline in product selling prices  which could ultimately reduce revenues and gross margins 
because we depend on international sales for a majority of our total sales  we may be subject to political  economic  and other conditions that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business 
during each of the last three years  international sales were a majority of our total sales 
during  sales outside of the us and canada constituted approximately of our total sales  and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales 
risks related to our foreign operations include unfavorable economic  market  political  and social conditions in a specific country or region fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates adverse changes in tax laws increased freight costs interruptions in air transportation 
table of contents reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries longer receivable collection periods natural or man made disasters in the countries or regions where we sell our products our business must comply with a variety of foreign laws and take risks associated with legislation and regulations for importing and exporting semiconductor products 
in the future  the united states or other countries may impose quotas  duties  tariffs  taxes  or other charges  restrictions  or trade barriers for the import or export of our products 
we rely heavily on distributors to generate a significant portion of our sales and fulfill our customer orders 
the failure of our distributors to perform as expected could materially reduce our future sales 
worldwide sales through distributors accounted for of our total sales during we rely on many distributors to help us create end customer demand  provide technical support and other value added services to end customers  fill customer orders  and stock our products 
our contracts with our distributors may be terminated by either party upon notice 
our distributors are located all over the world and are of various sizes and financial conditions 
lower sales  lower earnings  debt downgrades  the inability to access capital markets  and higher interest rates could potentially affect our distributors operations 
we are highly dependent on arrow electronics  inc  in many locations across the world  particularly in north america 
during  arrow electronics  inc arrow accounted for approximately of total sales on a worldwide basis  while our next largest distributor  altima corporation altima  accounted for approximately of total sales 
as of december   accounts receivable from arrow and altima individually accounted for and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable 
our ability to add or replace distributors is limited 
our distributors are contracted by altera to perform two primary  yet distinct  functions that are difficult to replace distributors provide logistics support  such as order entry  credit  forecasting  inventory management  and shipment of product  to end customers 
the process of integrating systems to allow for electronic data interchange is complex and can be time consuming 
distributors create demand for our products at the engineering level 
this mandates the training of the extended distributor sales force  as well as hiring and training specialized applications engineers skilled in promoting and servicing products at the engineering level 
in addition  our distributors expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels may not be easily transferable to a new distributor 
also  end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor 
we depend entirely on independent subcontractors to supply us with finished silicon wafers 
the failure of these subcontractors to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business 
nearly all of our silicon wafers are produced by tsmc in its manufacturing facilities located primarily in taiwan and the us silicon wafer production facilities have a fixed capacity that is allocated solely by our vendors and beyond our direct control 
we have no formalized long term supply or allocation commitments from our foundry suppliers 
our operations would be disrupted if tsmc ends its relationship with us and we are unable to arrange a satisfactory and cost effective alternative to quickly fulfill customer orders 
to ensure continued wafer supply  we may establish other wafer supply sources as these arrangements become economically advantageous or technically necessary 
however  only a few foundry vendors have the capability to manufacture our most advanced products 
if we engage alternative supply sources  we may encounter start up difficulties and incur additional costs 
in addition  shipments could be significantly delayed while these sources are qualified for volume production 

table of contents furthermore  because we rely on third party foundries  we have little or no direct control over production costs  delivery schedules  and wafer quality 
we also face increased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
wafer shortages and or increased wafer and assembly material costs could lower our gross margins  reduce our sales  or otherwise materially disrupt our business 
if market demand for silicon wafers or assembly material suddenly exceeds market supply  our supply of silicon wafers or assembly material could quickly become limited 
a shortage in manufacturing capacity could hinder our ability to meet product demand 
moreover  silicon wafers constitute more than half of our product cost 
if we are unable to purchase wafers at favorable prices  our gross margins will be adversely affected 
product manufacturing is complex  and our foundries may not achieve the necessary yields or product reliability that our business requires 
manufacturing our products is a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a tightly controlled environment 
we depend not only on sufficient foundry manufacturing capacity and wafer prices  but also good production yields the number of good die per wafer and timely wafer delivery to meet customer demand and maintain profit margins 
wafer production yields depend on a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
as a result  we may experience problems with achieving acceptable production yields and timely delivery from our foundry vendors 
difficulties in production yields can often occur when we begin new product production  when we transition to new processes  or when our principal wafer supplier  tsmc  moves production of a product from one manufacturing plant to another  or manufactures the same product at multiple factories 
as a result of manufacturing defects  tsmc has also occasionally scrapped wafers  resulting in longer manufacturing lead times 
further  production throughput times vary considerably among the various factories used by our wafer suppliers  and we may occasionally experience production delays 
these difficulties and delays can potentially cause significantly higher costs and lower product availability 
we depend on independent subcontractors  located in asia  to assemble  test  and ship our semiconductor products 
the failure of these subcontractors to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business 
because we rely on independent subcontractors to assemble  test  and ship our semiconductor products and to provide package piece parts  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules or quality levels 
we are dependent upon sufficient subcontractor assembly and test capacities  both in raw materials and services  to meet the demand for our own products 
our future success also depends on the financial viability of our independent subcontractors 
if market demand for subcontractor material and services exceeds available supply or if the subcontractors capital structures weaken  we may experience product shortages  quality assurance problems  and or increased manufacturing costs 
conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and distributors may impact their business operations and thereby adversely interrupt our manufacturing and sales processes 
the economic  market  social  and political situations in countries where certain independent subcontractors and distributors are located are unpredictable  can be volatile  and can have a significant impact on our business because we may be unable to obtain or distribute product in a timely manner 
market and political conditions  including currency fluctuation  terrorism  political strife  war  labor disruption  and other factors  including natural or man made disasters  adverse changes in tax laws  tariff  import or export quotas  power and water shortages  or interruption in air transportation  in areas where our independent subcontractors and distributors are located also could have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities 
for example  because we rely heavily on tsmc to produce a significant portion of our silicon wafers  earthquakes or other natural disasters in taiwan and asia could limit our wafer supply and thereby harm our business  financial condition  and operational results 

table of contents our failure to define  develop  and manufacture technologically advanced products would adversely affect the success and growth of our company 
we operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapid technological change 
our products are manufactured using a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a tightly controlled environment 
our current product development efforts focus on developing new plds  related development software and hardware  and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes 
our development efforts may not result in the timely introduction of competitive new products or product enhancements 
additionally  we may not be successful in developing new products or using and converting established products to new and more advanced process technologies 
for example  our current generation product families  the stratix iv and stratix iv gx families  are manufactured on a nanometer process technology  but our next generation product families will be manufactured on smaller circuit geometries we have not used before 
using advanced process technology has technological risks and start up difficulties that can adversely affect research and development spending  yields  product costs  and product delivery timeliness 
any prolonged disruption to our global communications infrastructure could impair our ability to plan factory activity and respond to customer demand 
demand for our products is highly volatile  especially at the detailed ordering code level 
to achieve short delivery lead times and superior levels of customer service while maintaining low levels of inventory  we constantly adjust our manufacturing subcontractors production schedules 
we develop and adjust these schedules based on end customer demand as communicated by our distributors and based on our inventory levels  manufacturing cycle times  component lead times  and projected production yields 
we combine and distribute all of this information electronically over a complex global communications network 
our ability to estimate demand and to adjust our production schedules is highly dependent on this network  we have no manual back up 
a prolonged disruption or service failure in a portion of this network would impair our ability to plan factory activity and respond to demand 
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue  gross margins  and net income 
we produce highly complex hardware and software products that incorporate leading edge technology 
our pre shipment testing programs may not detect all defects 
because our product warranties against materials and workmanship defects and non conformance to our specifications are for varying lengths of time  we have occasionally been required to repair or replace components or refund the purchase price paid due to product defects 
if the costs for customer or warranty claims increase significantly compared with our historical experience  our revenue  gross margins  and net income may be adversely affected 
for example  if we cannot fix a product defect in a timely manner  we may incur product reengineering expenses  increased inventory costs  or damage to our reputation  any of which could materially affect our revenue  gross margins  and net income 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
our devices are used in automotive  military  aerospace  avionics  medical equipment  and other systems where system failure could cause damage to property or people 
we may receive product liability claims if our devices cause system failures 
based on our historical experience  we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low  but will be higher if both the sales volume in these applications and the frequency of system failures caused by our devices increases 
our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes and other catastrophic events 
our corporate headquarters in san jose  california is located near major earthquake faults 
some of our international facilities and those of our key suppliers  including tsmc  are also located near major earthquake faults 
any catastrophic event  such as an earthquake or other natural disaster  could make it difficult for altera and our independent subcontractors to meet product design deadlines  maintain our records  pay our suppliers  or manufacture or ship our products 
as we carry only limited insurance coverage  any incurred liability resulting from uncovered claims could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset losses from covered incidents  and we do not have coverage for certain losses 
we believe our existing insurance coverage is consistent with common practice and economic and 
table of contents availability considerations 
if our insurance coverage is inadequate to protect us against unforeseen catastrophic losses  any uncovered losses could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
our business is subject to tax risks associated with being a multinational corporation 
altera does business in many countries  and is taxed according to multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and conventions 
these laws are subject to interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty  and can change over time 
therefore  altera could receive a tax assessment or judgment that causes a significant change to earnings related to prior periods and or an increase in our effective tax rate 
the failure of our intellectual property rights to provide meaningful protection from our competitors could harm our competitive position 
we rely on patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright  and mask work laws to protect our intellectual property  propriety information  and technology rights  and have increased our investment in these areas in the last several years 
as of december   we owned more than  us patents and foreign patents  and had more than  patents applications currently pending worldwide 
our patents and patent applications may not protect us from our competition  which may be able to circumvent our patents or develop new patentable technologies that displace our products 
in addition  other parties  including our former employees or consultants  may try to disclose  obtain  or use our propriety information or technologies without our authorization despite our best efforts at prevention 
if other companies obtain this information or develop similar information or technologies  they may develop products that compete against ours 
moreover  the laws of certain countries where we sell  manufacture  or distribute products may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and costly and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
even if we spend significant resources and efforts to protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
if others use our proprietary rights  it could materially harm our business and require expensive litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products 
we occasionally receive inquiries about possible patent infringements that may require us to obtain licenses relating to our current or future products 
we may be unable to obtain licenses on reasonable terms  or the license agreements may have set durations or may not provide complete protection against infringement claims involving all of our current or future products 
if we are sued for patent infringement  the costs and outcome of litigation will be unpredictable and may have a negative impact on our financial results 
intellectual property claims  regardless of their merit  can result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
legal proceedings are also unpredictable and may be affected by events outside of our control 
if our defense against intellectual property infringement claims is unsuccessful  we may be required to pay significant monetary damages or be subject to an injunction against the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product families 
alternatively  we could be required to spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  the success of which may be uncertain 
intellectual property litigation may have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 
we have been named as a party to several lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related accounting and reporting  and we may be named in additional litigation in the future  all of which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and the trading price for our securities 
lawsuits are currently pending against certain of our current and former directors and officers relating to our historical stock option practices and related accounting and reporting 
see part i  item legal proceedings and note legal proceedings to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these proceedings 
under certain circumstances  we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors and officers for these lawsuits 
the ultimate outcome of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price for our securities 
litigation may be time consuming  expensive  and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the 
table of contents defense of these lawsuits may result in significant expenditures and the continued diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our business

item legal proceedings 
we have been named as a party to several lawsuits concerning our historical stock option practices and related accounting and reporting 
in may and july  we were notified that three shareholder derivative lawsuits had been filed in the superior court of the state of california  county of santa clara  by persons identifying themselves as altera shareholders and purporting to act on behalf of altera  naming altera corporation as a nominal defendant and naming some of our current and former officers and directors as defendants

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in item and the risk factors included in item a of this annual report 
executive overview company and market overview we are a global semiconductor company  serving over  customers in communications  computer and storage  industrial  and consumer market segments 
we design  manufacture  and market a variety of products programmable logic devices plds  which consist of field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds  are standard semiconductor integrated circuits  or chips  that our customers program to perform desired logic functions in their electronic systems 
hardcopy application specific integrated circuit asic devices transition customer designs from high density fpgas to low cost non programmable devices for volume production 
pre defined design building blocks known as intellectual property ip cores can be licensed by customers to easily implement standard functions in their pld designs 
associated development tools are used to develop designs and program our plds 
in  sales of plds generated over of our revenue  with fpga and cpld sales comprising approximately and of total revenue  respectively 
the remainder of our sales is comprised of our hardcopy devices and configuration devices used in conjunction with our fpgas  as well as licensing of ip cores and proprietary development tools 
challenging business environment the global financial crisis is characterized by significant disruption in the banking system and financial markets  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  concerns about inflation and deflation  and slower overall economic activity 
as a result  the semiconductor industry  including the pld segment  has  in recent months  experienced a significant slowdown in customer orders and overall demand 
as has been the case in prior down cycles within the semiconductor industry  it is difficult to predict the severity and duration of the business downturn  as well as the timing or rate of business recovery 
we agree with many industry observers that the current recession will endure throughout most of  followed by a slow rate of recovery over the next two to three years 
consequently  we project our total revenue in to be less than total revenue in  and our annualized growth rate during the subsequent two or three years to be less than we have experienced in recent years our compound average growth rate in the past years has been 
strong and resilient financial business model since the pld market was created in the s  the financial business models of the leading pld suppliers have generally been favorable when compared to most other semiconductor companies 
high sales growth rates  fabless strategies  high barriers to entry  and proprietary architectures have helped drive strong financial results for pld suppliers 

table of contents as the semiconductor industry and the pld market have matured  revenue growth in the pld segment  while still higher than many other semiconductor segments  has slowed 
in recent years  we have increased our focus on enhancing our business model despite slower revenue growth 
through various programs to improve r d and sg a productivity  as well as a general movement to simplify our business processes  we have been able to achieve higher rates of net income as a percentage of total revenue and a higher return on equity 
as illustrated in the following table  these results have been achieved while also growing pld market share 
dollars in millions  except per share amounts year cagr net sales net income diluted income per share pld market share fpga market share compound annual growth rate we believe that our early focus on cost reduction and productivity enhancement before the business slowdown related to the current global financial crisis may provide us some benefits compared to other semiconductor companies 
our ability to maintain investment in the research and development of future products  which has been aided by our early and ongoing cost savings initiatives  is a vital factor for our future growth 
in addition  our prior work in analyzing business processes has not only allowed us to effectively identify and execute areas for simplification and cost reduction  but the concept of workflow efficiency is an increasingly valued aspect of our business culture 
this work and our evolving culture may be an asset as we navigate our company through the current recession 
market opportunity we believe that our greatest opportunity for growth is displacing asics and assps 
based on publicly available data and information derived from gartner dataquest  we estimate that the pld market was approximately billion in  and that the digital logic market  consisting primarily of asics and assps  was approximately billion 
because plds can be quickly programmed by the customer to perform the specific function needed by the customer  plds provide greater advantages in flexibility  development cost  and time to market than asic and assp alternatives 
because plds generally have a higher cost structure than these alternatives  they are particularly favored in applications where there is a substantial time to market advantage and where unit volumes are low 
some customers develop and prototype their system with plds for their time to market benefits and then redesign to an asic to reduce costs as volume increases 
due to greater architectural innovation and faster adoption of advanced process technology  we believe that customers will increasingly favor plds over asics and assps because advances in pld technology and in semiconductor manufacturing technology are lowering the relative cost  performance  and power consumption differential between plds and fixed chip alternatives we are increasingly successful in selling plds into applications and markets that have been traditionally served by asics and assps we can compete successfully for customer volume production needs as well as their initial prototyping and development needs the pld market peaked at approximately billion in and declined over the next two years to approximately billion in from to  the pld market has grown with a compound average growth rate of approximately 
due to the broad pld customer base  the diverse pld market segments  and the unpredictable nature of end customer demand  future pld market growth rates are difficult to forecast and may be lower than in recent years 
pld market growth will be driven by the growth of pld prototyping and production opportunities 
the two leading pld vendors serve an extremely large and diverse customer base and the opportunity to expand the number of customers may be limited 
as a result  a critical objective for pld vendors is not simply to add more prototyping customers  but to penetrate customers and end markets in high volume applications 
pld vendors ability to achieve higher production volume is contingent upon several factors  including their ability to offer cost effective 
table of contents solutions versus asics and assps  and end customer demand 
publicly available data suggests that the number of asic design starts is in decline which may drive an increase in the number of high volume pld applications 
competing for design wins we compete with other pld vendors to displace fixed chip logic alternatives and for market share within the pld market 
competition between pld vendors is most intense in the design win phase of the customer s design  when customers select products for use in the customer s electronic system 
because each pld vendor s products are proprietary  the cost to switch plds after a system has been designed and prototyped is very high 
therefore  a design win can provide the pld vendor with a profitable revenue stream through the life of the customer s program 
from the time a design win is secured  it can be two or more years before a customer starts volume production of its system 
typically  the customer selects the pld vendor relatively early in a customer s design process  but it may take several years to complete system design  build prototypes  sampled the marketplace for customer acceptance  make modifications  and manufacture in volume 
thus  there is a delay between developing a competitive advantage to a shift in the pld market  meaning that market share is a lagging indicator of relative competitive strength 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the success and timing of customer programs  and because the end markets are so fragmented we have over  pld customers  it is difficult even for pld vendors to gauge their own competitive strength in winning designs at a particular point in time 
developing competitive products a pld vendor s ability to secure design wins and to maintain or increase market share is highly dependent on the cost and quality of its products  particularly the effectiveness and reliability of its proprietary development software 
all pld vendors provide proprietary development software at little or no cost to the customer 
the software  working in tandem with device logic architecture and features  creates the functionality desired by the customer 
as customers gain familiarity with a particular pld vendor s software  they often want to use that same software again in another design  giving that pld vendor a potential advantage as the next system is designed 
we develop our software in parallel with our devices  and there are schedule and integration risks between the two processes 
if we fail to create adequate software to support our new devices as they are introduced  we weaken our competitive position  which can have long lasting effects if customers switch to competing solutions and become less familiar and less skilled with our software 
we focus the majority of our research and development resources on new generation fpgas because increasing our fpga market share is important to our long term growth and profitability 
due to the higher integration density and lower cost per function  the fpga market has outgrown the cpld market in recent times  and industry participants and observers believe this trend will continue 
since the initial introduction of our stratix and cyclone fpga families in  we have introduced several more fpga families  including the stratix ii  stratix ii gx  stratix iii  stratix iv  stratix iv gx  cyclone ii  cyclone iii  and arria gx families 
as a result of these product introductions  we estimate  based on publicly available data and with information derived from gartner dataquest  that our market share has increased as follows market share pld fpga cpld complementing our stratix fpgas is our hardcopy family of asics 
we first shipped hardcopy devices in  offering customers low cost  non programmable production devices that use our highest density fpgas as an integrated development vehicle 
converting the fpga design is virtually seamless and requires very little additional customer engineering 
hardcopy devices are targeted specifically at those applications and customers that have used plds for prototyping and development and traditional cell based asics from other vendors for their volume production needs 
in  our hardcopy asic revenues were less than of total revenue  and we believe the hardcopy family may increase as a percentage of revenues over the long term 
the availability of a hardcopy conversion path for high density fpga designs is a competitive advantage 
since  we have introduced newer versions of the hardcopy family to support newer generations of fpgas 
our 
table of contents approach is unique in the industry and may underperform our expectations 
as we develop new generations of fpgas  we may create parallel hardcopy devices  which would entail ongoing engineering effort and expense 
we have improved our cpld offering by introducing the max ii family in and the max iiz family in max ii cplds offer pricing and features that we believe are competitively attractive  with cost  performance  power consumption  and density that are superior to our previous offerings 
an fpga family typically reaches peak sales four to five years after product introduction 
as a result  the stratix ii and cyclone ii families we introduced in  which comprised approximately of total sales in  may be at or near peak sales 
we expect the products we introduced from to have yet to reach peak sales  but will eventually experience sales declines 
to improve or even sustain our growth rate  we must successfully introduce successor generations of devices 
the degree to which other pld vendors improve the competitiveness and execution of their products may impair our ability to improve our growth rate 
within the next several quarters  we plan to ship newer fpga families using more advanced production techniques that will further improve product performance and lower cost 
our foundry partner  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  will manufacture these die using production processes that are new to the industry 
given the extreme complexity of semiconductor fabrication  tsmc may encounter difficulties that could delay our product launch or limit supply so that we would be unable to meet customer commitments 
we may discover manufacturing errors after we begin shipping  which would harm customer relations and cause us to incur additional unforeseen costs 
simultaneous introduction of new pld architectures and ramp of new technology processes are inherently risky 
diagnosing failures  identifying root causes  and implementing corrective actions in a production wafer fabrication facility are expensive and time consuming 
we may not successfully commercialize our new products  or our new products may not enable us to maintain or increase market share 
some of our competitive offerings may be offered later than the competition and it is possible that our competitive offerings will be less effective  thus weakening our market share 
it is also possible that our primary competitor may have secured design wins that  when they enter production  will reverse some of our current market share success 
our main competitor is larger in size with more sales resources  and we may not enjoy the same success that we saw with previous fpga generations 
customer intimacy and cost optimized product strategy we rely on customer interaction to gain product development insights  and we make development decisions years before a product begins to ship 
we have been able to gain market share on the strength of our product definition methodology and the successful rollout of new products 
however  because our products are complex  we assume considerable risk with every new product introduction 
if we misinterpret customer requirements or demand changes  our products may become uncompetitive 
our competitors are knowledgeable and skilled and  in some cases  larger than we are 
since it is difficult to gauge competitive success until the design win phase is well underway  it may be too late to make changes to a generation of products if those products are uncompetitive 
if a product generation is uncompetitive and we lose market share  regaining customers is very challenging 
since and following the semiconductor industry correction  our strategy to displace asics and assps has emphasized the development of cost optimized products 
these products have contributed to growth across all of our market segments and are increasingly being used by our customers in production volumes  not just as prototyping or low volume solutions 
production volumes vary by industry  but customers buying our products in production volumes expect lower unit pricing 
consequently  our business today is subject to a wider gross margin range than the gross margin range associated with a less diverse  largely prototyping business 
depending on the mix of high and low volume business  our gross margins can vary more quarter to quarter than in the past 
since the majority of our business books and ships in the same quarter  forecasting our gross margins has also become more difficult 
while we believe that growth will occur across all of our market segments  our gross margins could move up or down if our growth pattern favors low volume or high volume applications 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our management believes that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any differences between these judgments and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates include those regarding revenue recognition  valuation of inventories  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to oems  or their subcontract manufacturers 
we sell more than of our products to distributors for subsequent resale to oems or their subcontract manufacturers 
in almost all cases  sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for subsequent price adjustments and returns  and we defer recognition of revenue until the products are resold by the distributor 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us with periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is so large and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
this reconciliation process requires us to estimate the amount of in transit shipments net of in transit returns to our distributors 
in transit days can significantly vary among geographies and individual distributors 
we also apply judgment when estimating the total value of price concessions earned by our distributors but not claimed by the end of the reporting period 
this is because there is a time lag between the price concessions earned and claimed by the distributors for any underlying resale of products 
any error in our judgment could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues  deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors  and net income 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost determined on a first in first out basis approximated by standard cost or market 
we establish provisions for inventory if it is in excess of projected customer demand  and the creation of such provisions results in a write down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to cost of goods sold 
historically  it has been difficult to forecast customer demand especially at the part number level 
many of the orders we receive from our customers and distributors request delivery of product on relatively short notice and with lead times less than our manufacturing cycle time 
in order to provide competitive delivery times to our customers  we build and stock a certain amount of inventory in anticipation of customer demand that may not materialize 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  we allow customers to cancel orders with minimal advance notice 
thus  even product built to satisfy specific customer orders may not ultimately be required to fulfill customer demand 
we routinely compare our inventory against projected demand and record provisions for excess and obsolete inventories as necessary 
however  actual demand may materially differ from our projected demand  and this difference could have a material impact on our gross margin and inventory balances based on additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory or a benefit from inventory previously written down 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax liabilities and the determination of net deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition methods 
we record valuation allowances  when necessary  to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that management estimates is more likely than not to be realized 
if in the future we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our net 
table of contents deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate under fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  may be required to be paid as a result of such examinations 
if the payment ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the tax liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed 
adjustments for differences between our tax provisions and tax returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third or fourth quarter of our subsequent year 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based payment expense is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r on december   we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
our current estimate of volatility is based on a blend of average historical and implied volatility for publicly traded options on our stock with a term of one year or more 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based payment expense in future periods 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based payment expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon our historical experience 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future  our stock based payment expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
we derive the expected term assumption based on our historical settlement experience 
in the future  as empirical evidence regarding these input estimates is available to provide more directionally predictive results  we may change or refine our approach of deriving these input estimates 
these changes could impact our fair value of stock options granted in the future 
see note stock based compensation to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the valuation of stock based compensation 
results of operations on september   our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from the friday nearest december to december of each year 
this change is effective beginning with our fiscal year and has no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any previously reported period 
as a result of the change in our fiscal year end  our fiscal year ended december  contains days and our fiscal years ended december  and december  each contain days

sales overview net sales were billion in  billion in and billion in net sales increased in from  and decreased in from and sales trends were characterized by strong double digit growth in new products  pld expansion into new applications enabled by advances in technology and performance  increasing programmable content in electronic systems and displacement of alternative products  and periods of rising demand in emerging markets 
these favorable trends were offset by varying degrees of declines in the mainstream and mature product categories in both and no single end customer provided more than of our total sales for  or sales by product category we classify our products into three categories new  mainstream  and mature and other products 
the composition of each product category is as follows new products include the stratix ii and gx  stratix iii  stratix iv  arria  cyclone ii  cyclone iii  max ii  hardcopy  and hardcopy ii devices  mainstream products include the stratix and gx  cyclone  and max a devices  and mature and other products include the classic  max  max a  max b  max s  max  flex series  apex series  mercury  excalibur  configuration and other devices  intellectual property cores  and software and other tools 
sales by product category were as follows annual growth rate new mainstream mature and other total sales sales by market segment the following market segment data is derived from data that is provided to us by our distributors and end customers 
with a broad base of customers  who in some cases manufacture end products spanning multiple market segments  the 
table of contents assignment of revenue to a market segment requires the use of estimates  judgment  and extrapolation 
as such  actual results may differ from those reported 
sales by market segment were as follows annual growth rate communications industrial consumer computer and storage total sales sales in the communications and industrial segments advanced in compared to  primarily as a result of strong traction in asic and assp replacement 
additionally  sales in these market segments were lower due to wide spread customer inventory reduction programs 
sales in the computer and storage segment declined in compared to  primarily as a result of inventory reductions and program transitions by customers 
sales in the consumer segment declined in  primarily due to customer program transitions and a slowdown in the world wide economy 
sales in were characterized by lackluster demand in the communications and computer and storage market  despite the favorable long term growth dynamics for programmable logic devices 
our industrial segment grew but below the projected long term growth rate 
our consumer segment  however  grew substantially as altera s new product offerings gained traction in a number of digital media applications 
sales of fpgas and cplds our plds consist of field programmable gate arrays  or fpgas  and complex programmable logic devices  or cplds 
fpgas consist of our stratix  cyclone  arria  apex  flex  and acex series  as well as our excalibur and mercury families 
cplds consist of our max  max ii  and classic families

the geographic location of distributors may be different from the geographic location of the ultimate end users 
sales by geography were as follows annual growth rate north america asia pacific europe japan total sales 
table of contents price concessions and product returns from distributors we sell each item in our product catalog to all of our distributors worldwide at a list price 
however  distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated prices based on a variety of factors  including customer  product  quantity  geography and competitive differentiation 
the majority of our distributors sales to their customers are priced at a discount from our list price 
under these circumstances  we remit back to the distributor a portion of its original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed and we validate the distributor s resale information  including end customer  device  quantity and price  against the approved distributor price concession 
to receive price concessions  distributors must submit the price concession claims to us for approval within days of the resale of the product to an end customer 
primarily because of the uncertainty related to the final price  we defer revenue recognition on sales to distributors until our products are sold from the distributor to the end customer  which is when our price is fixed or determinable 
accordingly  these pricing uncertainties impact our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
total price concessions paid to distributors were billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
average aggregate price concessions paid typically range from to of our list price on an annual basis  depending upon the composition of our sales  volume and factors associated with timing 
our distributors have certain rights under our contracts to return defective  overstocked  obsolete and discontinued products 
our stock rotation program generally allows distributors to return unsold product to altera  subject to certain contract limits based on a percentage of sales occurring over various periods prior to the stock rotation 
products resold by the distributor to end customers are no longer eligible for return 
returns from distributors totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
gross margin gross margin percentage gross margin percentages increased in compared to primarily as a result of material cost improvements  as well as favorable market segment mix 
gross margin rates are heavily influenced by the timing and extent of both of these factors 
while these variables will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis  we are targeting a gross margin over the long term 
we believe the gross margin target affords us the right mix of growth opportunities across all served markets 
gross margin percentages declined in compared to primarily as a result of market segment mix 
stock based compensation expense included in cost of sales was insignificant in  and research and development expense research and development expense includes costs for compensation and benefits  stock based compensation  development masks  prototype wafers  and depreciation and amortization 
these expenditures are for the design of new pld and asic families  the development of process technologies  new package technology  software to support new products and design environments  and ip cores 
we will continue to make significant investments in the development of new products and focus our efforts on the development of new programmable logic devices that utilize advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes  as well as related development software

deferred compensation plan we allow our us based officers and director level employees to defer a portion of their compensation under the altera corporation non qualified deferred compensation plan nqdc plan 
since the inception of the nqdc plan  we have not made any contributions to the nqdc plan and we have no commitments to do so in the future 
there are no nqdc plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or minimum return on investments 
investment income or loss earned by the nqdc plan is recorded as loss gain on deferred compensation plan securities in our consolidated statements of income 
we reported losses gains on nqdc plan assets of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts resulted from the overall market performance of the underlying securities 
the investment loss gain also represents a decrease increase in the future payout to employees and is recorded as compensation expense benefit deferred compensation plan in our consolidated

the compensation expense benefit associated with our deferred compensation plan obligations is offset by losses gains from related securities 
the net effect of the investment income or loss and related compensation expense or benefit has no impact on our income before income taxes  net income  or cash balances 
see note employee benefits plans to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our nqdc plan 
interest income and other interest income and other consists mainly of interest income generated from investments in high quality fixed income securities 
the decrease of million in interest income and other in from was primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower returns on our money market funds 
the increase of million in interest income and other in from was driven by higher investment yields

as of december   we have borrowed million under the facility 
the remaining capacity of million available under the facility also represents a source of liquidity 
the terms of the facility require compliance with certain financial and non financial covenants 
financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios related to interest coverage and financial leverage 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
see note long term credit facility to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the facility

as discussed in note to our condensed consolidated financial statements  sales to distributors are primarily made under agreements allowing for subsequent price adjustments and returns  and we defer recognition of revenue until the products are resold by the distributor 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable at the list selling price since there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay us currently for product delivered  relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor  and record deferred revenue and deferred cost of sales in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheets 
accordingly  decreases in accounts receivable  net associated with lower billings are generally offset by corresponding decreases in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors 
however  timing differences between gross billings  discounts earned  collections  and revenue recognition may result in temporary interruption to the normal relationship between these two accounts 
the million decrease in accounts receivable  net  principally relates to decreased shipments to distributors and oems associated with a downward trend in demand for our products in december compared to december consistent with the dynamics described above  deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors decreased by million during  based on our practice of deferring such amounts until products are resold by the distributor

in addition to the above obligations  in the normal course of business  we enter into a variety of agreements and financial commitments 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk as a result of changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  certain interest rate sensitive nqdc plan assets and our long term credit facility 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturity dates totaling billion as of december  the market value of these investments on any given day during the investment term may vary as a result of market interest rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates during the investment term would not likely have a material impact on the fair value of the portfolio 
the actual impact on the fair value of the portfolio in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on actual balances and changes in the timing and the amount of interest rate movements 
our consolidated operating results are dependent on  among other factors  interest income and realized gains from the sale of marketable securities 
if the interest rate declines or we are unable to realize gains from the sale of marketable securities  our consolidated operating results may be negatively impacted 
in addition to our cash flows from operations  we derive our liquidity from our long term credit facility the facility 
our total borrowings under the facility as of december  were million 
borrowings under this facility bear a variable interest rate at either a eurodollar rate libor or a prime rate  at our option  plus an applicable margin based upon certain financial ratios  determined and payable quarterly 
the interest rate as of december  was libor plus 
in addition  we pay a facility fee on the entire facility 
this facility fee varies with certain financial ratios and was as of december  our consolidated operating results and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates that could adversely affect the amount of interest expense incurred and paid on the facility in any given period 
due to the variable interest rate on the facility  the fair value of the facility would not likely be materially affected by any future changes in the interest rates 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk inherent in the marketable equity securities held in our nqdc plan 
a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of these equity securities would not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows 
foreign currency risk although we purchase the majority of our materials and services in us dollars and sell our products to oems and distributors in us dollars  we do have international operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility  resulting from foreign currency transaction gains and losses and remeasurement of local currency assets and liabilities into us dollars  has been insignificant 
during  we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes related to the construction cost for our new building in penang  malaysia 
as of december   all forward foreign exchange contracts had matured 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates as of december   our consolidated financial position  operating results and cash flows would not be materially affected 
however  we cannot assure that there will not be a material impact in the future
