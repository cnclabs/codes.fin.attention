as part of the strategic plan  we expect fewer and more strategic acquisitions to be completed 
all acquisitions should create value by enhancing tsr  they should have clear strategic rationale and sustainable competitive advantage in attractive markets 
acquisitions we had no significant acquisitions in acquisitions we acquired three businesses during with annualized sales of approximately million broken down by segment as follows commercial fixturing components million industrial materials million specialized products million in commercial fixturing components we added one business located in china which produces office chair controls 
we also added one business to the industrial materials segment  which produces coated wire products  including racks for dishwashers 
finally  
table of contents part i in the specialized products segment  we added a business which is a designer and assembler of docking stations that secure computer and other electronic equipment inside vehicles 
acquisitions we acquired five businesses in with annualized sales of about million 
all of the transactions occurred in the residential furnishings segment 
these acquisitions broadened our geographic presence and product offering in geo components  expanded our carpet underlay business  and added to our international spring operations 
for further information about acquisitions  see note g on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
divestitures we divested five significant businesses in with annualized sales of approximately million 
the largest divestiture approximately million in annualized revenue was the aluminum products segment which was sold in july we also sold four other business units in wood products and fibers previously in the residential furnishings segment  plastics previously in the commercial fixturing components segment  and the dealer portion of commercial vehicle products previously in the specialized products segment 
two additional business units are targeted for divestiture coated fabrics and storage products 
we are in discussions with potential buyers and expect to complete the remaining dispositions in the near term  although current market conditions may impact the timing of these dispositions 
to date  we have received after tax cash proceeds of approximately million for the five divested businesses  not including subordinated notes and preferred stock 
all of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations 
divestitures in the first quarter of  we divested our prime foam products business unit previously in the residential furnishings segment and received after tax cash proceeds of approximately million 
our former prime foam products business unit had annual revenue of approximately million and has been classified as a discontinued operation 
for further information about divestitures and discontinued operations  see note b on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
new product development in  we introduced a significant  new proprietary innerspring design to the bedding market 
this new patented product  verticoil  provides an attractive alternative to generic bonnell innersprings that have been available in the market for decades 
verticoil provides 
table of contents part i our customers unique surface and structural features that we believe are preferable over those of bonnell innersprings 
in addition to offering value to our customers  the unique design of verticoil enables us to produce these innersprings using less steel wire  which represents a cost savings that provides enhanced margins for leggett 
we began ramping up production of verticoil in  and conversion from bonnell innersprings to verticoil is continuing in segment financial information for information about sales to external customers  sales by product line  earnings before interest and taxes  and total assets of each of our segments  refer to note o on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign operations the percentages of our external sales from continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the united states for the previous three years are shown below 
logo our international continuing operations are principally located in europe  china  canada and mexico 
the products we make in these countries primarily consist of europe innersprings for mattresses wire and wire products lumbar and seat suspension systems for automotive seating machinery and equipment designed to manufacture innersprings for mattresses and other bedding related components design and distribution of point of purchase displays for retailers 
table of contents part i china innersprings for mattresses recliner mechanisms and bases for upholstered furniture formed wire for upholstered furniture retail store fixtures and gondola shelving office furniture components  including chair bases and casters stamped seat frames and formed metal products for automotive seating cables and small electric motors used in lumbar systems for automotive seating machinery and replacement parts for machines used in the bedding industry canada innersprings for mattresses fabricated wire for the bedding  furniture and automotive industries chair bases  table bases and office chair controls lumbar supports for automotive seats wire and steel storage systems and racks for the interior of service vans and utility vehicles mexico innersprings and fabricated wire for the bedding industry retail shelving and point of purchase displays automotive control cable systems our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe demand for components is growing 
also  in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas  we have located facilities nearby to supply them efficiently 
our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country 
these risks include nationalization of private enterprises political instability in certain countries foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights credit risks increased costs due to tariffs  customs and shipping rates potential problems obtaining raw materials  and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war foreign currency fluctuation these and other foreign related risks could result in cost increases  reduced profits  the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business 

table of contents part i geographic areas of operation we have production  warehousing and distribution facilities in countries around the world 
below is a list of countries where we have facilities associated with continuing operations logo for further information concerning our external sales from continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the united states and our long lived assets outside the united states  refer to note o on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents part i sales by product line the following table shows our approximate percentage of external sales from continuing operations by product line for the last three years product line bedding group fabric carpet underlay group furniture group wire group fixture display group automotive group office furniture components group commercial vehicle products group machinery group tubing group distribution of products in each of our segments  we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own sales personnel 
however  many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors 
we do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would  if terminated  have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 
raw materials the products we manufacture in continuing operations require a variety of raw materials 
among the most important are various types of steel  including scrap  rod  wire  coil  sheet and angle iron foam scrap woven and non woven fabrics we supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make 
for example  we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire  which we then use to manufacture innersprings and foundations for mattresses springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas displays  shelving and racks for retailers automotive seating components we supply the majority of our steel rod requirements through our own rod mill 
our own wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our us requirements for steel wire 
we also produce welded steel tubing both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers 
we believe that worldwide supply sources are available for all the raw materials we use 
however  we have experienced volatility in raw material prices in the last three years  most 
table of contents part i notably in steel 
early in the cost of steel scrap increased  leading to higher rod costs 
we implemented price increases to pass through some of these costs 
in late  once again we began experiencing higher steel costs  and significant increases occurred in we implemented price increases to recover most of these higher costs 
market prices began to abate late in  but for certain types of steel  continued to be well above levels 
the future pricing of raw materials is uncertain 
the degree to which we are able to mitigate or recover higher costs  should they occur  could influence our future earnings 
also  if raw material costs decrease there may be downward pressure on selling prices  temporarily resulting in lower segment margins as we consume higher cost inventories 
higher raw material costs have led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some cases  higher cost components have been replaced with lower cost components  causing us to shift production accordingly 
this has primarily impacted profit margins in our residential furnishings and industrial materials segments 
we have responded by developing new products including new types of innersprings and box springs that enable our customers to reduce their total costs  and in certain instances  provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations 
customer concentration we serve thousands of customers worldwide  sustaining many long term business relationships 
in  no customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations 
our top customers accounted for approximately of these consolidated revenues 
specialized products has one customer whose purchases accounted for approximately of the segment s sales from continuing operations in the loss of this customer may have a material adverse effect upon the segment 

table of contents part i patents and trademarks the chart below shows the approximate numbers of patents issued  patents in process  trademarks issued and trademarks in process held by our continuing operations at the end of no single patent or group of patents  or trademark or group of trademarks  is material to our continuing operations 
most of our patents and trademarks relate to products sold in the specialized products and residential furnishings segments 
logo we also have patents  patents in process  trademarks and trademarks in process in discontinued operations 
some of our most significant trademarks include semi flex and semi fold boxspring components and foundations mira coil  verticoil  lura flex and superlastic mattress innersprings lifestyles  s cape and adjustables by leggett platt adjustable electric beds wall hugger recliner chair mechanisms super sagless motion and sofa sleeper mechanisms no sag wire forms used in seating tack jump and pattern link quilting machines hanes fiber materials schukra  pullmaflex and flex o lator automotive seating products spuhl mattress innerspring manufacturing machines gribetz and porter quilting and sewing machines quietflex and masterack equipment and accessories for vans and trucks research and development we maintain research  engineering and testing centers in carthage  missouri  and do additional research and development work at many of our other facilities 
we are unable to precisely calculate the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in 
table of contents part i product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas 
however  we estimate the cost of research and development associated with continuing operations was approximately to million in each of the last three years 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees associated with our continuing operations  of which roughly  were engaged in production 
of the  approximately  are international employees 
labor unions represent roughly  of our employees associated with continuing operations 
we did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during the chart below shows the approximate number of employees associated with continuing operations by segment 
logo as of december   the company had approximately  employees associated with its continuing operations 
employees in discontinued operations at december   we had approximately employees associated with discontinued operations  of which employees are in the residential furnishings segment and employees are in the commercial fixturing components segment 
for more information on our discontinued operations  see note b on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company had approximately  employees associated with its discontinued operations 

table of contents part i competition many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell 
the number of competing companies varies by product line  but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we tend to attract and retain customers through product quality  innovation  competitive pricing and customer service 
many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but  depending upon the particular product  we experience competition based on quality  performance and availability as well 
we believe we are the largest independent manufacturer in north america  in terms of revenue  of the following components for residential furniture and bedding carpet underlay components for office furniture drawn steel wire automotive seat support and lumbar systems adjustable beds bedding industry machinery for wire forming  sewing and quilting we face increasing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia 
in instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas  we believe our operations should be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
accordingly  at the end of  leggett operated facilities in china 
in recent years we experienced increased competition in the us from foreign bedding component manufacturers 
we reacted to this competition by selectively adjusting prices  and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs 
the increased price competition for bedding components was partially due to lower wire costs in china 
asian manufacturers benefit from cost advantages for commodities such as steel and chemicals 
foreign manufacturers also benefit from lenient regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters 
in late  we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from china  south africa and vietnam 
we saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during after the antidumping investigations began  and as a result  we regained market share 
the investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early we should see improved performance in our bedding group as imported innersprings from these countries will now have to be sold at fair prices 
the current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant  ranging from to  and will remain in effect for at least years 
seasonality as a diversified manufacturer  we generally have not experienced significant seasonality 
the timing of acquisitions  dispositions  and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses 
nevertheless  for the company as a whole  the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales  while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower 

table of contents part i our four segments tend to experience seasonality as follows residential furnishings typically has the strongest sales in the second and third quarters due to increased consumer demand for bedding and furniture during those periods 
commercial fixturing components generally has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixture products  with the first and fourth quarters normally lower 
this aligns with the retail industry s normal construction cycle the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season 
industrial materials minimal variation in sales throughout the year 
specialized products relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales  although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer 
backlog our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments 
production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships 
working capital items for information regarding working capital items  see the discussion of cash from operations in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  on page environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment 
we have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in keeping with good corporate citizenship and a commitment to protect the environment 
while we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies  management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  capital expenditures  consolidated financial condition or results of operations

discontinued operations as a result of our strategic plan  several of our businesses are disclosed in our annual financial statements as discontinued operations since i the operations and cash flows of the businesses can be clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations  ii the businesses have either been disposed of or are classified as held for sale  and iii we do not  or will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses after the disposal transactions 
the discontinued operations include aluminum products segment 
we divested this segment in july it produced and sold non automotive aluminum  zinc and magnesium die castings  and new and refurbished dies also known as molds or tools for all types and sizes of die casting machines 
it also provided machining  coating  finishing  sub assembly and other value added services for die cast components

item a 
risk factors 
investing in our securities involves risk 
set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 
we have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products 
as a supplier of products to a variety of industries  we are adversely affected by general economic downturns 
our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products 
market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence 
to a lesser extent  market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors  including disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  energy costs and interest rates 
all of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and drive demand for our products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
demand weakness in the us home related  retail  and other markets has led to lower unit order activity  sales and earnings in our businesses 
several factors  including a weak us economy  higher energy costs  a depressed housing market  and low consumer confidence contributed to conservative spending habits by us consumers 
late in the third quarter of  our markets weakened appreciably as consumers further reined in spending during this period of credit concerns and stock market volatility 
short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited long term visibility into demand trends  however  we currently expect market demand to be soft in if economic and market conditions remain uncertain or deteriorate further  we may experience material negative impacts on our business  financial condition  operating cash flows and results of operations 

table of contents part i us and global financial and credit market volatility could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we continue to monitor our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity in light of the recent distress in the financial and credit markets 
further changes in the financial or credit markets could adversely affect us in several different areas as discussed below 
due to the recent tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit  our customers may be delayed in obtaining  or may not be able to obtain  necessary cash for their purchases 
additionally  our suppliers could be negatively impacted by the current credit and financial market conditions causing delays in product deliveries to us 
these delays could negatively impact our customers and or suppliers ability to conduct business and could adversely affect our unit volume and revenues  and therefore harm our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
recent deterioration in the securities markets has also impacted asset values of our defined benefit plans 
plan assets and liabilities are measured at december of each year 
at december   our defined benefit plans were under funded by approximately million  which represented of the plans benefit obligations 
changes in the value of plan assets did not have an impact on the income statement  however reduced benefit plan assets will result in increased costs in and may increase the amount or accelerate the timing of required future funding contributions 
cash equivalents  short term investments and derivative financial instruments are subject to market value and counterparty risks 
changes in the fair value of these items may adversely impact our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
these balances could also be impacted if the counterparties are unable to meet their commitments in accordance with the terms of agreements 
costs of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results 
raw material cost increases and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases can significantly impact our earnings 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  therefore  our raw material costs move with the market 
steel is our most significant raw material 
in late we began seeing higher steel costs  and further increases occurred in the global steel markets are very cyclical in nature  and can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year 
our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of foam scrap 
we experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of this commodity in recent years 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
inability to recover cost increases or a delay in the recovery time can negatively impact our earnings 
also  higher raw material costs led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some 
table of contents part i cases  higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components 
this has primarily impacted our residential furnishings and industrial materials product mix and decreased profit margins 
this trend could further negatively impact our results of operations 
our debt instrument ratings may be further downgraded which will increase our cost of borrowing  reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and may negatively impact our liquidity 
we have maintained a debt rating in the a category from moody s and standard and poor s on our term notes and public debt for over a decade 
on november   moody s downgraded the company s long term debt rating from a to a and our commercial paper rating from p to p citing accelerating contraction in residential and automotive related consumer spending 
also  on november   s p downgraded the company s long term corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings from a to a and our short term and commercial paper ratings from a to a citing weak market conditions and financial policies that include a high dividend payout and share repurchases 
in addition  both moody s and s p assigned a negative outlook to each of their respective ratings 
if the rating agencies were to further downgrade our debt instruments  this may have a negative effect on our cost of borrowing  our ability to issue commercial paper and ultimately on our liquidity 
for further information regarding our debt ratings refer to page we may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
continued economic uncertainty could change our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets 
asian competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
we believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price  but  depending upon the particular product  we experience competition based on quality  performance and availability as well 
we face increasing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia 
if we are unable to purchase key raw materials  such as steel  at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers  our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed 
our long lived assets are subject to potential asset impairment 
a significant portion of our assets consist of goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets not held for sale represented approximately billion  or approximately of our total assets 
in addition  net property  plant and equipment  sundry assets and non current assets held for sale totaled approximately million  or approximately of total assets 

table of contents part i we review for potential goodwill impairment on an annual basis as part of our goodwill impairment testing in the second quarter of each year  and more often  if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists 
in addition  we test for the recoverability of long lived assets at year end  and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted interim impairment testing as a result of the changes announced with the strategic plan and determined that some long lived assets were impaired 
for the year ended december   we incurred goodwill impairment of million  and long lived asset impairment of million 
the annual goodwill impairment review performed in june indicated no goodwill impairments 
as a result of the deterioration in the economic and financial climate in the fourth quarter of  interim goodwill and other long lived asset impairment analyses were performed in the fourth quarter 
the goodwill analysis confirmed that fair values exceeded carrying value for all reporting units 
future cash flow assumptions were reduced to reflect lower sales and production levels for and  returning to historical levels thereafter 
other long lived asset impairment charges of million were recorded in the fourth quarter throughout  we recorded million of goodwill and million of other long lived asset impairments related to businesses held for sale as updated estimates of fair value less costs to sell became more certain 
if actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations  the company could incur future unanticipated impairment charges 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales  which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in  of our sales from continuing operations was generated by international operations 
the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies  however  certain of our operations experience currency related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
further  our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results

item legal proceedings 
anti dumping petition on december   the company filed a petition with the us department of commerce doc and the us international trade commission itc alleging that manufacturers of uncovered innersprings in china  south africa and vietnam were unfairly selling their products in the united states at less than fair value dumping and causing material injury to us innerspring producers 
the itc made a preliminary determination of material injury to the domestic innerspring industry in this case 
on july   the doc announced preliminary duties on innersprings imported from these three countries ranging from to and instructed the us customs and border protection to collect a cash deposit or bond on any ongoing imports 
on october  the doc announced final dumping duties on innersprings from south africa at and from vietnam at 
on november   the itc made affirmative final determinations that imports from south africa and vietnam caused material injury to the us innerspring industry 
on december   the doc announced final dumping duties on innersprings from china at to  and on january   the itc made final determinations that the domestic innerspring industry has been materially injured by innersprings imported from china

shareholder claim on february   a shareholder derivative complaint was filed by the new england carpenters pension fund  which represented that it owns  shares of leggett stock  in the circuit court of jasper county  missouri 
the complaint is substantially similar to a lawsuit filed by the new england carpenters pension fund in federal court on september   which the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed on september  without prejudice to its right to re file 
however  this new lawsuit has fewer claims and asserts no federal causes of action 
the action is purportedly brought on behalf of the company  naming it as a nominal defendant and naming as defendants certain current and former officers and directors of the company including david s

the plaintiff alleges  among other things  that the individual defendants participated in the backdating of stock options  breached fiduciary duties  caused or allowed the company to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements  and sold company stock while in possession of material non public information 
the plaintiff seeks  among other things  unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants  certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct  the adoption of certain company corporate governance proposals  the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants stock options and proceeds  punitive damages  the rescission of certain unexercised options  and the reimbursement of litigation costs 
the plaintiff is not seeking any monetary relief from the company 
policies of directors and officers liability insurance are in force  subject to customary limits and exclusions 
the complaint is based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and leggett stock prices that we believe is flawed 
we believe this lawsuit does not take into consideration important aspects of leggett s stock option plans 
for example  the plaintiff has noted only one set of stock option grants  made on december   within what we believe to be the applicable year statute of limitations 
these option grants were made in accordance with the company s deferred compensation program  which i provided that options would be dated on the last business day of december  and ii was filed with the sec on december  setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date 
we provided plaintiff s counsel with this publicly available documentation before they dismissed the prior federal court lawsuit 
the company expects that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  operating cash flows or results of operations

table of contents part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
highlights in  there were two significant and opposing forces in play 
on the positive side  we successfully implemented leggett s most significant strategic changes in quite some time 
on the negative side  the us economy and stock market suffered from their worst performance in decades 
in late we unveiled plans to significantly change the company s strategic course 
we have not yet reached our long term performance targets for margins and returns but we made substantial strategic strides in we adopted tsr as our primary strategic objective and introduced tsr based incentives for senior executives 
we set a goal to consistently achieve tsr within the top of the s p  which we believe will require average annual tsr of 
we also adopted role based portfolio management and implemented a formal  rigorous strategic planning process to continually assess each business unit s role in the portfolio 
during the year  we divested five businesses including the aluminum products segment for total after tax proceeds in excess of million  and contracted our store fixtures business unit to a smaller  metal focused operation that should generate higher profit 
we also increased our quarterly dividend by and repurchased million shares of our stock 
late in the third quarter of  our markets weakened appreciably as consumers reined in their spending in light of the financial market distress and general us and global economic conditions 
weak market demand  partially offset by market share gains in certain businesses  led to lower sales and earnings in we met our goal to achieve tsr within the top of the s p  in fact  our tsr ranked within the top 
however  tsrs in general for all companies were significantly depressed  and only of the s p posted a positive tsr in our tsr of negative was well below the we anticipate over the long term 
though strong in  cash from operations was lower than the record set in primarily due to a smaller year over year decrease in working capital 
cash from operations has been and is expected to continue to be sufficient to fund both capital expenditures and dividends 
we are well situated to weather this challenging economic environment 
we ended the year with net debt as a percentage of net capital below our long term  targeted range  no significant long term debt matures until  and we have more than million available under our existing commercial paper program and revolver facility 
these topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow 

table of contents part ii introduction what we do leggett platt is a diversified manufacturer that conceives  designs  and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in most homes  offices  and automobiles  and many retail stores 
we make components that are often hidden within  but integral to  our customers products 
we are north america s leading independent manufacturer of components for residential furniture and bedding  carpet underlay  components for office furniture  drawn steel wire  automotive seat support and lumbar systems  and bedding industry machinery 
our segments our continuing operations are composed of business units in four segments  with approximately  employee partners  and more than production facilities located in countries around the world 
our segments are described below 
logo residential furnishings this segment supplies a variety of components mainly used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products 
we also sell carpet cushion  adjustable beds  bed frames  ornamental beds  and geo components 
commercial fixturing components operations in this segment manufacture and sell store fixtures and point of purchase displays used in retail stores 
we also produce chair controls  bases  and other components for office furniture manufacturers 

table of contents part ii industrial materials these operations primarily supply steel rod  drawn steel wire  steel billets  and welded steel tubing to other leggett operations and to external customers 
our wire and tubing is used to make bedding  furniture  automotive seats  wire retail fixtures  mechanical springs  and many other end products 
specialized products from this segment we supply lumbar systems and wire components used by automotive seating manufacturers 
we manufacture and install the racks  shelving and cabinets used to outfit fleets of service vans 
we also produce machinery  both for ourselves and for others  including bedding manufacturers 
discontinued operations and divestitures during the past two years  we have divested six businesses 
in  we sold our aluminum products segment and four smaller business units wood products  fibers  plastics  and the dealer portion of commercial vehicle products 
we received after tax cash proceeds of million for these five businesses  we also received subordinated notes and preferred stock 
in early  we sold our prime foam operations 
two additional business units coated fabrics and storage products are also targeted for divestiture 
all of these businesses  including the two that remain  are disclosed in our financial statements as discontinued operations 
for the remaining divestitures  we expect to recover the carrying value of the net assets held for sale 
net assets classified as held for sale totaled million at december  this includes million not associated with the remaining divestitures 
recent market conditions have delayed the expected timing of the sale of these remaining businesses  completing these transactions remains a high priority for strategic direction during  we completed an extensive review of our business portfolio in an effort to enhance shareholder return 
for each business unit  we considered factors such as competitive advantages  market position  financial performance  and potential growth opportunities 
we have made significant changes to our financial targets  portfolio mix  and planning processes as a result of the review 
total shareholder return tsr is now the key success measure that we use to monitor performance 
tsr is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay 
tsr change in stock price dividends beginning stock price 
there are four key sources of tsr revenue growth  margin expansion  dividends  and share repurchases 
historically  our primary objective was profitable growth 
going forward  we intend to generate higher tsr through a balanced approach that employs all four sources of tsr 
we have modified our incentive plans to emphasize the importance of  and reward  tsr 
beginning in  we introduced tsr based incentives for senior executives and modified business unit bonuses to give more importance to achieving higher returns on the assets under their direct control 

table of contents part ii we have adopted role based portfolio management and will concentrate future investments in businesses with strong competitive advantages and financial health 
certain of our businesses categorized as grow are positioned to generate value through further growth  while others categorized as core are positioned to drive value by improving ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and optimizing operating cash flow while employing minimal amounts of capital 
we allocate capital to each business unit based upon its role in the portfolio 
we plan to invest in grow businesses that hold strong competitive positions and consistently achieve compelling returns on those investments 
we plan to maintain or improve our competitive position in core businesses that typically hold stable positions in solid markets  and focus on improving returns but limit further investment in these operations 
in total  we anticipate lower capital expenditures and fewer acquisitions in the near term 
we have implemented a more rigorous strategic planning process to continually assess our business units and help guide future decisions regarding the role of each business unit  capital allocation priorities  and new areas in which to grow 
we review the portfolio classification of each unit at least on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role 
this review includes several different criteria such as competitive position  market conditions  business unit size  and fit within our overall objectives  as well as financial indicators such as ebitda and operating cash flows relative to the amount of capital employed 
to remain in the portfolio  business units are expected to consistently generate after tax returns in excess of our cost of capital 
business units may employ a variety of means to achieve higher returns  including trimming expenses  introducing new products  improving productivity  adopting more disciplined pricing  reducing working capital  and consolidating assets 
business units that fail to attain minimum return goals will be moved to the fix or divest categories 
as a result of the strategic review  we narrowed our focus and eliminated approximately of our portfolio through the divestiture of the aluminum products segment and four additional business units two other divestitures remain 
we also placed our store fixtures business unit into the fix category and gave it a one year period in which to improve returns to at least cost of capital levels 
in the third quarter of  we concluded that the store fixtures unit  in its previous form  was not capable of meeting our return requirements 
as a result  we narrowed the unit s scope to focus primarily on the metals part of the fixtures industry  in alignment with leggett s core competency of producing steel and steel related products 
we consolidated four wood store fixtures operations into two facilities and will continue to produce a reduced amount of wood fixtures in order to meet the blended requirements ie metal and wood of certain of our customers 
we also effected changes to senior management  further reduced the unit s overhead  and purged additional customer accounts with unacceptable margins 
these changes are expected to trim annual trade sales for the store fixtures business unit from a run rate in late of approximately million to approximately million in  and we expect annual returns to at least match our cost of capital 
the unit is now considered a core business within our portfolio  as such  its primary focus is to optimize operating cash flow and improve profit while minimizing its use of capital 

table of contents part ii activities related to the fix and divest businesses resulted in charges that impacted our operating results in and those charges are discussed on page under the section titled asset impairments and restructuring related charges 
the strategic changes have increased available cash  and we are returning much of this cash to shareholders 
in november  the board of directors authorized a dividend increase  moving the quarterly rate to 
per share from the previous 
for the year  we also repurchased nearly million shares of our stock  fully exhausting our annual repurchase authorization of million shares  and partially utilizing the supplementary authorization to purchase additional shares with proceeds from the divestitures 
we expect to continue repurchasing our shares  but the timing of those repurchases will depend on several factors  including general economic and market conditions  the price of leggett stock  and our working capital needs 
customers we serve a broad suite of customers  with no single one representing even of our sales 
many are companies whose names are widely recognized  they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding  a variety of other manufacturers  and many major retailers 
major factors that impact our business many factors impact our business  but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand  recent economic events  raw material cost trends  and competition 
market demand market demand including product mix is impacted by several economic factors  with consumer confidence being most significant 
other important factors include disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  and interest rates 
all these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore affect demand for our components and products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
recent economic events in light of recent distress in the financial and credit markets and the related impact on us and global economies we have been impacted  and may continue to be impacted  in several different areas as discussed below 
lower market wide demand 
throughout and  demand weakness in the us home related  retail  and other markets led to lower unit order activity  sales and earnings in our businesses 
several factors  including a weak us economy  higher energy costs  a depressed housing market  and low consumer confidence contributed to conservative spending habits by us consumers 
late in the third quarter of  our global markets weakened appreciably as consumers further reined in spending during this period of credit concerns and stock market volatility 
short lead times in most of our markets allow for very limited long term visibility into demand trends  however  we 
table of contents part ii currently expect market demand to be soft in despite the global economic decline  we have gained market share in our us bedding components businesses primarily due to i bedding manufacturers shifting innerspring purchases from international to domestic sources as a result of antidumping duties imposed on imported innersprings from china  south africa  and vietnam  ii the deverticalization of a strong regional bedding manufacturer they now buy from us components they had previously produced for themselves  and iii increased demand for innerspring mattresses  rather than premium priced  non innerspring products 
these market share gains offset some of the demand weakness 
customers and suppliers 
due to the recent tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit  our customers may be delayed in obtaining  or may not be able to obtain  necessary cash for their purchases 
additionally  our suppliers could be negatively impacted by the current credit and financial market conditions causing delays in product deliveries to us 
these delays could negatively impact our customers and suppliers ability to conduct business and could adversely affect our unit order activity and sales  and therefore negatively impact our cash flows and liquidity 
management s response to recent economic events 
activities completed over the past few years including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan  closure of underperforming and underutilized facilities  elimination of sales with unacceptable margins  and other cost reduction initiatives improved our cost position in advance of the late economic contraction 
in response to the recent economic events  we reduced production and were running well below our normal utilization levels during the fourth quarter in an effort to bring inventories in line with current demand 
we have further reduced headcount  overhead costs  and capital spending  and are completing the closure of certain facilities 
given our balance sheet  operating cash flow and access to credit  we expect to be able to endure an extended downturn in market demand with no material impact to our financial position or liquidity 
raw material costs in many of our businesses  we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials 
this purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have 
still  our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials many of which are commodities fluctuate 
purchasing arrangements vary across the company 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  accordingly our raw material costs generally move with the market 
in certain of our businesses  we have longer term purchase contracts with pricing terms that provide stability under reasonable market conditions 
however  when commodities experience extreme inflation  vendors do not always honor those contracts 
our ability to recover higher costs through selling price increases is crucial 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
conversely  when costs decrease significantly  we generally pass a portion of those lower costs through to our customers 
the timing of our price increases or decreases is a critical factor  we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs  so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline 

table of contents part ii steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity 
in most cases  the major changes both increases and decreases were passed through to customers via selling price adjustments 
in late we began seeing higher steel costs  and significant increases occurred in we implemented price increases to recover these higher costs 
market prices began to abate late in the year  but for certain types of steel  continued to be well above prior year levels 
with the precipitous drop in market demand beginning late in the third quarter  and the need to reduce inventories that were purchased before steel costs declined  at year end we had not yet made substantial purchases of the lower cost steel 
our other raw materials include woven and non woven fabrics  foam scrap  fibers  and chemicals 
we have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years  and typically pass them through to our customers 
when we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs  this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components 
we experienced this de contenting effect in our residential furnishings and industrial materials segments in recent years  as our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address steel and chemical inflation 
our profit margins were negatively impacted by this de contenting 
we are responding by developing new products including new types of innersprings and boxsprings that enable our customers to reduce their total costs  and in certain instances  provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations 
some of these new products were introduced during  with production of those products ramping up in competition many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line 
in general  our competitors tend to be smaller  private companies 
we believe we gain competitive advantage in our global markets through low cost operations  significant internal production of key raw materials  superior manufacturing expertise and product innovation  higher quality products  extensive customer service capabilities  and greater financial strength 
many of our competitors  both domestic and foreign  compete primarily on the basis of price 
our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive  while delivering product quality  innovation  and customer service 
we continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia 
in instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas  our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
we currently operate facilities in china 
in recent years we experienced increased competition in the us from foreign bedding component manufacturers 
we reacted to this competition by selectively adjusting prices  and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs 
the increased price competition for bedding components was partially due to lower wire costs in china 
asian manufacturers benefit from cost advantages for commodities such as 
table of contents part ii steel and chemicals 
foreign manufacturers also benefit from lenient regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters 
in late  we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from china  south africa and vietnam 
we saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during after the antidumping investigations began  and as a result  we regained market share 
the investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early we should see improved performance in our bedding group as imported innersprings from these countries will now have to be sold at fair prices 
the current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant  ranging from to  and will remain in effect for at least years 
asset impairments and restructuring related charges net impairment and restructuring related charges for both continuing and discontinued operations totaled million in and million in the majority of these charges occurred as a result of the strategic changes announced in late those details are discussed in the paragraphs below 
net impairment and restructuring related charges not associated with the strategic plan totaled million in and million in in the fourth quarter  we recognized million primarily non cash of impairment and restructuring related charges associated with the strategic plan 
these charges which included both continuing and discontinued operations include goodwill impairments for the fixture display reporting unit of million and the aluminum reporting unit of million 
goodwill and asset impairment charges related to other held for sale businesses totaled million 
restructuring related charges totaled million 
in  we incurred additional costs totaling million related to the strategic plan 
this total includes million of restructuring related costs  million of goodwill impairment charges  million of asset impairment charges  and million of losses from sale of assets 
to date  we have incurred total costs associated with the strategic plan of million million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations and believe the activity to be substantially complete 
for further information about asset impairments and restructuring  see notes c and d to the consolidated financial statements on pages and as discussed on pages and  in late the store fixtures business unit was placed in the fix category and given a one year period in which to improve returns to at least cost of capital levels 
in the fall of  we concluded that the business unit should be contracted to a smaller  metal focused business 
this strategy change did not result in any goodwill impairment charges 
the store fixtures business unit is included in our fixture display reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
we conduct an annual review for potential goodwill impairment in june and long lived asset impairment at year end for all of our reporting units 
we also review for potential impairment if an event or change in circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its 
table of contents part ii carrying amount or impact the recoverability of the assets 
at december   the fixture display reporting unit had million of goodwill and million of other long lived assets million of the long lived assets were associated with the store fixtures business unit 
for further information regarding the methodology we use for impairment testing  the assumptions we use for this testing and the potential for future impairment  refer to critical accounting policies on page  and also note c to the consolidated financial statements on page 
table of contents part ii results of operations vs 
during  sales from continuing operations decreased 
we reported full year net earnings from continuing operations of million  which included million of restructuring related charges  impairments  and other items 
our earnings reflected extremely soft market demand which led to lower unit volume in many of our businesses 
in the majority of our markets  demand was soft throughout the year  but weakened appreciably late in the third quarter as consumers further reduced their spending in response to the financial market distress and general us and global economic conditions 
market share gains in certain businesses offset some of the impact from weak demand 
during the year  we also experienced significant inflation in steel costs  and we successfully implemented price increases to recover the majority of these higher costs 
further details about our consolidated and segment results from continuing operations are discussed below 
consolidated results continuing operations the following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during  and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes 
reported amounts for have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification of our coated fabrics business unit from continuing to discontinued operations

table of contents part ii sales from continuing operations decreased versus  primarily reflecting extremely weak market demand and our decision to exit specific sales volume with unacceptable profit margins primarily in our store fixtures business 
these declines were partially offset by inflation related price increases and market share gains 
our us bedding components business gained market share in as a result of i bedding manufacturers shifting innerspring purchases from international to domestic sources  ii the deverticalization of a strong regional bedding manufacturer  and  iii increased demand for innerspring mattresses  rather than premium priced  non innerspring products 
we experienced significant inflation in steel costs during  and in response  we implemented price increases to recover the higher costs 
the magnitude of our selling price increases varied by product line depending on steel content  but in our major residential and industrial businesses  prices increased substantially 
in recent months  steel costs have abated 
as costs were increasing  we experienced a lag in recovering them  likewise  as costs decline we also expect to realize a lag in any price reductions we give back to our customers 
full year earnings from continuing operations were higher than in  primarily due to non recurrence of goodwill impairment charges related to our fixture display group million non recurrence of tax items million adjustments to valuation allowances related to potential foreign tax benefits lower interest expense several factors negatively impacted earnings 
the most significant were unit volume declines down roughly for the year higher restructuring related charges and asset impairments million reduced production levels with the significant pull back in demand late in the year  we cut production even below depressed demand levels and reduced inventories lifo impact all of our segments use the first in  first out fifo method for valuing inventory 
in our consolidated financials  an adjustment is made at the corporate level ie outside the segments to convert about of our inventories to the last in  first out lifo method 
these are primarily our domestic  steel related inventories 
significant steel cost increases during the year  along with moderately higher levels of these steel related inventories  resulted in lifo expense from continuing operations of million in versus a million benefit in 
segment level earnings in generally benefited under the fifo method from the effect of rising commodity costs 
for further discussion of inventories  see note a to the consolidated financial statements on page interest and income taxes net interest expense decreased million versus  primarily the result of debt maturities paid in and  as well as lower commercial paper borrowings 

table of contents part ii the consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate for was also lower  at versus in the rate was negatively impacted by goodwill impairment charges totaling million  of which million were non deductible 
this caused the rate as a percent of pre tax income to be much higher than normal 
in  a tax benefit associated with the write off of an acquired company s stock was offset by increased reserves for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for certain foreign entities 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a million valuation allowance against certain foreign tax assets 
the valuation allowance related to our canadian automotive operations that produce lumbar supports 
the automotive industry is currently in a dramatic state of decline  which has reduced the demand for our components 
in addition to demand factors  these operations have also been negatively impacted by the strength in recent years of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar our canadian automotive operations sell in us dollars while incurring labor and overhead costs in canadian dollars  thereby reducing margins 
as a result  we believe it is more likely than not we won t realize the benefit of deferred tax assets associated with these operations 
as a result of recording this tax valuation allowance  we specifically reviewed expected future cash flows for this component of the automotive reporting unit as part of the annual long lived asset impairment review 
based upon current facts and circumstances  we believe that the carrying value of these operations is recoverable through future operating cash flows 
performance in and the first half of was negatively impacted by the strength of the canadian versus the us dollar 
while it is difficult to predict the future movement in exchange rates  the canadian dollar has recently weakened versus the us dollar 
if that trend were to continue  this would contribute to the improvement of margins going forward 
the carrying value of these operations was million at december   and we expect the future cash flows to recover those assets 
currently  the operations generate positive cash flows that we expect to improve in through the combination of overhead reductions and reduced material costs caused by expected lower steel prices 
we continue to be awarded new product placements so we believe market share loss is not a factor impacting recent performance

this decrease was partially offset by inflation related price increases and market share gains in our us bedding business discussed under consolidated results above 
demand in our us residential markets was weak throughout  but softened further in late september reflecting reduced spending by consumers on large ticket items that contain our products 
international markets  which were relatively stronger earlier in the year  also experienced much softer demand in the latter part of the year as a result of deteriorating global economic conditions

our machinery and european and asian automotive businesses posted full year sales growth despite demand softening late in the year 
ebit and ebit margins decreased versus the prior year  mainly due to lower sales  higher restructuring related costs of million  and higher steel costs with limited recovery 
results from discontinued operations full year earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax  increased million  from a loss of million in to a loss of million in this earnings increase was primarily due to lower asset impairments and restructuring related charges of million  partially offset by the non recurrence of a tax benefit of million associated with a difference in book and tax basis of an acquired company s stock as a result of reaching held for sale status 

table of contents part ii results of operations vs

we experienced soft demand throughout in the us home related and retail markets that we serve  but these declines were partially offset by strength in most of our international markets and the non dealer portion of the domestic commercial vehicle products business 
these trends are discussed in the segment results below 
full year earnings from continuing operations of 
per share were significantly lower than the prior year  primarily due to the non cash charges and tax items  but also from weak demand in many of our domestic markets 

table of contents part ii interest and income taxes net interest expense in was generally comparable to the consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate in was  versus in the rate was below historical levels primarily due to the benefit from the write off of an acquired company s stock  and a reduction in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credits recorded in as part of a foreign entity restructuring and cash repatriation transaction 
the rate was negatively impacted by goodwill impairment charges totaling million  of which million were non deductible 
this caused the rate as a percent of pre tax income to be much higher than normal 
segment results continuing operations in the following section we discuss sales and ebit from continuing operations for each of our segments

acquisitions net of two small divestitures partially offset the decline 
the sales decrease is primarily due to soft demand in the us residential markets during and very strong sales in our carpet underlay business during international demand for both bedding and upholstered furniture components was considerably stronger  and partially offset the domestic sales declines 
ebit and ebit margins decreased versus primarily due to the internal sales decline

table of contents part ii commercial fixturing components dollar amounts in millions sales ebit ebit margins year ended december  year ended december  decrease decrease internal sales decrease acquisitions net of small divestitures sales decreased in  primarily due to lower store fixtures volume and our decision to walk away from sales with unacceptable margins  but also from slightly lower demand for office furniture components 
ebit and ebit margins were significantly lower than  primarily due to a large  non cash goodwill impairment charge 
the major factors impacting ebit were goodwill impairment million higher asset impairment and restructuring related charges million in vs

industrial materials dollar amounts in millions sales ebit ebit margins year ended december  year ended december  decrease decrease internal sales decrease acquisitions net of small divestitures internal sales declined during the year  but this decrease was mostly offset by acquisitions net of small divestitures 
continued softness in the us residential markets led to lower unit volume in our wire operations  but this decline was partially offset by inflation related sales growth from price increases we implemented to recover higher raw material costs 
ebit and ebit margins were flat with the prior year  as the impact of lower sales was offset by earnings from an acquired business 

table of contents part ii specialized products dollar amounts in millions sales ebit ebit margins year ended december  year ended december  increase increase internal sales growth acquisitions net of small divestitures strong sales increases in reflected world wide growth in our automotive business  and continued solid performance in the non dealer portion of commercial vehicle products 
acquisitions net of a small divestiture also contributed to higher sales during the year 
ebit and ebit margins improved significantly  reflecting higher sales in the segment and earnings from a company acquired early in these gains were partially offset as the strength of the canadian dollar negatively impacted our automotive business we incur costs in canadian dollars and sell in us dollars 
results from discontinued operations full year earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax  declined million  from million in to a loss of million in the earnings decline was primarily due to higher asset impairments and restructuring related charges of million non recurrence of the reimbursement of a duty on canadian lumber imports of million softer demand  lower capacity utilization  and manufacturing inefficiencies in certain operations these items were partially offset by a tax benefit of million associated with a difference in book and tax basis of an acquired company s stock as a result of reaching held for sale status 

table of contents part ii liquidity and capitalization in this section  we provide details  reflecting both continuing and discontinued operations  about our uses of cash cash from operations debt position and total capitalization we use cash for the following finance capital requirements eg productivity  growth and acquisitions pay dividends repurchase our stock typically  our operations provide much of the cash we require  and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs 
however in  cash proceeds from completed divestitures were another significant source of funds 
we ended with net debt to net capital of  below our long term target  and in line with year end levels 
our long term target is to have net debt as a percent of net capital in the range 
page presents a table of the calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital at the end of the past two years 
uses of cash finance capital requirements for the next year or two  improving returns of the existing asset base will continue to be our primary focus 
however  cash is available to fund selective growth  both internally through capital expenditures and externally through acquisitions 
logo 
table of contents part ii capital expenditures include investments we make to modernize  maintain  and expand manufacturing capacity 
with our move to role based portfolio management  we are more restrictive in funding capital projects 
capital spending in is expected to be reduced to about million 
growth capital  which had historically been available to all our businesses  is now predominantly earmarked for our grow business units 
operations designated as core business units receive capital primarily for productivity enhancements  but expansion capital is limited 
we have also set a higher bar for acquisitions  and plan to pursue disciplined growth through fewer  but more strategic  opportunities 
we will seek acquisitions within our growth businesses  and will also look for longer term opportunities to enter new  higher growth markets that meet strict criteria 
as a result of the new acquisition criteria  no significant acquisitions were completed in in  we acquired three businesses that were expected to add about million to annual revenue million in commercial fixturing components  million in industrial materials  and million in specialized products 
these businesses n established a foothold in asian production of office chair controls n manufactured coated wire products  including racks for dishwashers  and presented leggett with expanded technologies and cross segment selling opportunities n broadened our suite of products for commercial vehicle interiors we acquired five businesses in that were expected to add about million to annual revenue 
all these transactions occurred in the residential furnishings segment 
these acquisitions n broadened our geographic presence and product offerings in geo components n expanded our rubber carpet underlay business n added to our international spring operations in addition to the initial cash outlays for acquisitions shown in the accompanying chart  we also assumed debt of million in and million in we provide additional details about acquisitions in note g to the consolidated financial statements on page 
table of contents part ii pay dividends logo with planned improvements in returns  a decrease in capital spending and acquisitions  and the completion of the divestitures  we expect and have recently had more available cash to return to shareholders 
higher annual dividends are one means by which that will occur 
in late  we raised our quarterly dividend to 
per share  a increase over the previous 
per share quarterly rate 
this marks  for  leggett s th consecutive annual dividend increase at an average compound annual growth rate of over 
our targeted dividend payout is approximately of net earnings  but has been higher recently and will likely remain above targeted levels for the next few years 
maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority 
we expect to spend approximately million on dividends in less than in because of share repurchases 
cash from operations has been in recent years  and is expected to continue to be  sufficient to fund both capital expenditures and dividends 
repurchase stock logo share repurchases are the other means by which we return cash to shareholders 
during the past three years  we repurchased a total of million shares of our stock and 
table of contents part ii reduced outstanding shares by about 
we repurchased a record million of these shares in  or approximately of shares outstanding  at an average per share price of 
as we have consistently stated  we intend to use the majority of divestiture proceeds to buy shares of our stock  and to date  we have used approximately half of those funds 
the remaining purchases are expected to be completed at a slower pace than previously anticipated as we cautiously await indications that the economy is improving 
although no specific repurchase schedule has been established  we have been authorized by the board to repurchase up to million shares in cash from operations cash from operations is our primary source of funds 
earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations 
logo cash from operations in  though strong  was million lower than in primarily due to a smaller year over year decrease in working capital 
extremely weak market demand in the latter part of which resulted from the financial and credit market distress and related impact on us and global economies negatively impacted earnings 
we expect this demand weakness to continue in working capital decreased in the changes by major category are reflected in the table below 
fourth quarter production cuts resulted in lower inventory levels versus the prior year 
accounts receivable also declined primarily due to extremely weak sales late in the year 
we continue to aggressively manage our operations in an effort to further improve our working capital position 
some of our specific actions include reducing raw material purchases and production levels where appropriate  increasing collection efforts to ensure customer accounts are paid on time  and optimizing payment terms with our vendors 
in  cash from operations increased million versus  as significant working capital improvements offset lower earnings 
the working capital improvements resulted primarily from better accounts receivable collections and ongoing efforts to manage inventories 

table of contents part ii the following table presents key working capital measures at the end of the past two years 
amount in millions days outstanding decrease decrease accounts receivable  net inventory  net accounts payable the accounts receivable ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as ending net accounts receivable net sales number of days in the year 
the inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as ending net inventory cost of goods sold number of days in the year 
the accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as ending accounts payable cost of goods sold number of days in the year 
amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to move the coated fabrics business unit to held for sale and discontinued operations in the first quarter of working capital levels vary by segment 
the commercial fixturing components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the fixture display group 
this business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products  longer manufacturing lead times in certain cases  and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time 
at december   we reclassified certain assets related to the planned divestitures as held for sale and ceased depreciation and amortization on those assets 
depreciation and amortization expense in was million lower than in  primarily as a result of the divestitures 

table of contents part ii capitalization this table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt outstanding scheduled maturities average interest rates average maturities in years revolving credit commercial paper total long term debt deferred income taxes and other liabilities shareholders equity total capitalization unused committed credit long term short term total unused committed credit current maturities of long term debt cash and cash equivalents ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x these calculations include current maturities  but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities 
shareholder s equity decreased million in  primarily reflecting net share repurchases of million  dividends of million  and currency impacts of million 
fixed charges include interest expense  capitalized interest  plus implied interest included in operating leases 
earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes  plus fixed charges 
the next table shows the percent of long term debt to total capitalization at december  and  calculated in two ways long term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table 
long term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long term debt 

table of contents part ii we believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more meaningful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly 
we use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net debt total capitalization current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net capitalization long term debt to total capitalization net debt to net capitalization total debt which includes long term debt and current debt maturities decreased million in during the year  we reduced our commercial paper borrowings by million and paid off million of other long term debt that came due 
we can raise cash by issuing up to million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders that terminates in at december   million of commercial paper was outstanding under this program and is classified as long term debt 
cash proceeds from the divestitures discussed on page were used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance during our commercial paper program has continued to operate efficiently during the recent disruption of global credit markets 
however  the change in the credit markets and our short term ratings downgrade discussed below has resulted in an increase of less than basis points in the weighted average effective borrowing rate for the commercial paper issued 
this would equate to an additional annual interest cost of less than million based on the level of commercial paper that was issued at the end of in the event that the disruption in the credit markets was to become so severe that we were unable to issue commercial paper  we have the contractual right to draw funds directly on our revolving credit agreement 
in such event  the cost of borrowing under the credit agreement could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowing 
the revolving credit agreement provides for the ability to replace outstanding letters of credit 
to the extent that we utilize these commitments for letters of credit  it would reduce our commercial paper loan capacity by a corresponding amount 
over the last two years the list of specific banks participating in our revolving credit agreement has modestly changed as some banks have assigned their lending commitments under the agreement to other participating banks or new participants  all of which have assumed the respective lending obligations 
these assignments and assumptions have had no material impact on the availability of credit under the agreement or on the terms or covenants of the agreement 
based on the information currently available to us  we believe that the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet their obligations under the agreement 

table of contents part ii with anticipated operating cash flows and the commercial paper program in place  we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing operations  pay dividends  repurchase stock  and fund future growth 
most of our debt has fixed repayment dates 
at the end of  this debt consisted primarily of term notes 
we have maintained a debt rating in the a category from moody s and standard and poor s on our term notes and public debt for over a decade 
on november   moody s downgraded our long term debt rating from a to a and our commercial paper rating from p to p citing accelerating contraction in residential and automotive related consumer spending 
on november   s p downgraded our long term corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings from a to a and our short term and commercial paper ratings from a to a citing weak market conditions and financial policies that include a high dividend payout and share repurchases 
in addition  both moody s and s p assigned a negative outlook to each of their respective ratings 
the ratings downgrades have not had an impact on our ability to issue commercial paper  but they have increased  and are expected to continue to increase  our cost of short term borrowing 
also  if we choose to borrow under our million revolving credit agreement  which expires in  our interest cost under this agreement would be increased approximately five basis points as a result of the new ratings 
we do not expect the ratings downgrades to have a material impact on our liquidity or our ability to access the long term credit market 
these credit ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only 
an explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency 
these ratings are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change 
each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and  therefore  each rating should be evaluated separately 

table of contents part ii contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations and commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollar amounts in millions long term debt capitalized leases operating leases purchase obligations interest payments deferred income taxes other obligations total contractual cash obligations the long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due 
long term debt includes million of outstanding commercial paper 
we have classified commercial paper as long term debt due in years since the commercial paper program is supported by a million revolving credit agreement which terminates in purchase obligations primarily include open short term days purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities 
interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at december  at rates in effect at the end of the year 
these totals include interest on the million of outstanding commercial paper discussed above 
other obligations include uncertain tax positions of million in the more than years column because these obligations are long term in nature and actual payment dates can not be specifically determined 
other obligations also include our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension plans 

table of contents part ii critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to do so  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and disclosures 
if we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change  and some of those changes could be significant 
our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management  at the time they are made  to be reasonable and appropriate 
estimates are adjusted for actual events  as they occur 
critical accounting estimates are those that are a subject to uncertainty and change  and b of material impact to our financial statements 
listed here are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements asset and goodwill impairment inventory workers compensation  general liability  and employee benefit programs credit losses pension accounting income taxes contingencies we provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in note a to the consolidated financial statements on page asset and goodwill impairment goodwill is assessed for impairment annually  and as triggering events occur 
other long lived assets are tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the assessments are performed to ensure that future cash flows from use of the assets exceed the assets book value 
in doing so  we make judgments and estimates about a the future cash flows expected from use and eventual disposition of the assets  and b the assets fair market values 
if actual future cash flows are lower than our estimates  we could incur future unanticipated impairment charges 
our ten reporting units for goodwill purposes related to continuing operations are one level below our operating segments  and are the same as the business groups disclosed in item business 
we assess our reporting units for possible goodwill impairment on an annual basis and whenever events warrant 
in doing so  we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for similar entities using price to earnings ratios 
key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate  internal sales growth  margins  capital expenditure requirements  and working capital requirements 
recent performance of the reporting unit is an important factor  but not the only factor  in our assessment 

table of contents part ii the annual goodwill impairment review performed in june indicated no goodwill impairments 
as a result of the deterioration in the economic and financial climate in the fourth quarter of  interim goodwill and other long lived asset impairment analyses were performed in the fourth quarter 
the goodwill analysis confirmed that estimated fair values exceeded carrying values for all reporting units 
future cash flow assumptions were reduced to reflect lower sales and production levels for and  returning to historical levels thereafter 
other long lived asset impairment charges of million were recorded in the fourth quarter if actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations  the company could incur future unanticipated impairment charges 
throughout  we recorded million of goodwill and million of other long lived asset impairments related to businesses held for sale as updated estimates of fair value less costs to sell became more certain 
in june  we performed the annual goodwill impairment review and determined that no impairments were indicated for any reporting units 
in the fourth quarter  we performed an interim goodwill impairment review as a result of the november strategic plan which was considered a triggering event as defined in fas the fair value of each reporting unit was adjusted to reflect the significant decrease in the company s overall market value since june 
in addition  individual reporting units impacted by the strategic plan were revised to reflect updated margin and growth assumptions 
since the carrying amounts of our fixture display and aluminum products reporting units were determined to exceed their fair values  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units identified above were determined using the discounted cash flow method and comparable market values for similar entities using price to earnings ratios 
application of the discounted cash flow method requires significant projections and assumptions 
the significant assumptions used in this approach include estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  operating plans  industry data and other relevant factors 
as a result of this process  we recorded goodwill impairment charges in the fourth quarter of related to the fixture display and aluminum products reporting units of and million  respectively 
in addition  we recorded goodwill and asset impairments of million in the fourth quarter relating to other held for sale locations 
discounted cash flow projections for these two reporting units were based on year financial forecasts 
these forecasts were based on annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing the business 
the significant assumptions of these forecasts included a compound annual growth rate during the years of and 
table of contents part ii related to fixture display and aluminum products  respectively 
terminal values for each reporting unit were calculated using a long term growth rate of 
future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of for fixture display and for aluminum products 
actual results may differ materially from these assumptions 
if actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations  we could incur future unanticipated impairment charges in the fixture display reporting unit 
inventory in determining the value of inventories  we make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow moving ie not selling very quickly 
if we have had no sales of a given product for months  those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely 
if we have more than a one year s supply of a product  we value that inventory at net realizable value what we think we will recover  historically  this write down has been approximately on average 
at december   we had reduced inventory values of continuing operations by million approximately of the total fifo inventory to account for obsolete and slow moving items 
at december   an adjustment of million had been recognized  resulting in a decrease in the valuation allowance during of million 
a summary of the inventory valuation allowance by segment is as follows in millions segment residential furnishings commercial fixturing components industrial materials specialized products total the valuation allowance in residential furnishings includes million for the coated fabrics business that we intend to divest as part of the strategic plan  but that did not meet the requirements for held for sale and discontinued operations treatment until these adjustments relate to a broad range of products 
the majority of the residential furnishings valuation allowance relates to innerspring products  steel mechanisms and hardware for furniture  and structural fabrics for mattresses and furniture 
the commercial fixturing components valuation allowance is primarily for store fixtures and displays  and to a lesser extent  office components and chair controls 
the industrial materials valuation allowance is mostly for wire retail fixtures 
the specialized products valuation allowance is for automotive lumbar and seat suspension systems  digital printing machinery  and component parts used in the assembly of van interiors 
workers compensation  general liability  and employee benefit programs we are substantially self insured for certain costs related to workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability  property  and medical insurance 
when estimating the potential amounts we might have to pay since we are self insured  we consider a number of factors  including historical claim experience  demographic factors  and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers 

table of contents part ii over the past five years  we have incurred  on average  million annually for costs associated with these insurance programs 
average year to year variation over the past five years has been approximately million 
at december   we had accrued million to cover future self insurance liabilities 
credit losses our customers are diverse 
many are small to medium sized companies  and some are highly leveraged 
bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning 
we regularly evaluate the ability of our customers to pay what they owe us 
when we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay  we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible 
we consider factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  industry and macroeconomic considerations  and historical experience 
the total amount of credit losses over the last three years is million 
at december   our reserves for doubtful accounts not held for sale totaled million about of our accounts and notes receivable of million 
pension accounting for our pension plans  we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and the current value of those benefit obligations 
the two most critical assumptions affecting these estimates are the discount rate and the expected return on assets 
other assumptions include rates of compensation increases  withdrawal and mortality rates  and retirement ages 
these estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations 
we have recognized the impact of individual plans funded amounts on the balance sheet  and in  changed to a december measurement date from september in previous years 
to reflect market interest rates  in the discount rate for our major pension plans was unchanged at 
this follows an increase in from to 
for  we assumed long term returns of on the assets of these plans  which was identical to our and assumptions 
sensitivity to changes in the critical assumptions for our major plans is as follows discount rate a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 
million and decrease the plans funded status by approximately million 
expected return on assets a basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by 
million  but have no effect on the plans funded status 
we expect that the combined contribution in to our defined benefit plans will total approximately million 
on december   our defined benefit retirement plan covering non union employees was frozen  thereby eliminating the future accrual of benefits to participants and closing the plan to future enrollment 
this plan change reduced the projected benefit obligation by million  and reduced pension expense by million 
participants were moved to a defined contribution plan with a company contribution based upon the age of the participant 

table of contents part ii income taxes in the ordinary course of business  we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions  even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time 
these estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements 
subsequent to year end  we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns 
tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions  including among other things the timing and amounts of deductions  and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain 
at december   six open years were undergoing or subject to audit by the united states internal revenue service irs and canada revenue agency 
amended federal returns were filed with the irs in for the tax year with a refund of million expected 
these filings are subject to review by the irs  with the largest issue related to a research and development credit 
in  the irs examination for the years and was concluded 
a final report was issued  and the net refund of approximately million  plus interest  was received in the largest issue pertained to a refund claim we made for a worthless stock deduction 
the resolution of this item was reflected in as a reduction in the company s overall tax rate 
canada revenue agency examinations are underway for through  which are at various stages of completion  but to date the company is not aware of any material adjustments 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
valuation reserves are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts that we believe have no more than a probability of being realized 
in addition  assumptions have been made regarding the non repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries 
those assumptions may change in the future  thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of such earnings 
contingencies our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies ie  losses that may or may not occur are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur  and our estimate of the likely cost 
our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation  the results of which are generally very unpredictable 
the company has been named as one of numerous defendants in several cases consolidated as gray v 
derderian  case no 
cv l  usdc usdc this litigation resulted from a nightclub fire in west warwick  rhode island involving multiple deaths and injuries 
along with other foam manufacturing defendants  the company is alleged to have manufactured and sold bulk polyurethane foam to a foam fabricator in rhode island  who in turn  is alleged to have fabricated and sold foam sheets to the nightclub 
the foam was among other materials alleged to have caught fire when pyrotechnics were ignited inside the nightclub

table of contents part ii company s primary insurance carrier reached a tentative settlement with counsel for all plaintiffs on april  if the settlement is approved by the court  the company will pay a million self insured retention and the remainder of the million settlement is the responsibility of the insurance carrier

on february   a shareholder derivative complaint was filed by the new england carpenters pension fund  which represented that it owns  shares of leggett stock  in the circuit court of jasper county  missouri 
the complaint is substantially similar to a lawsuit filed by the new england carpenters pension fund in federal court on september   which the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed on september  without prejudice to its right to re file 
however  this new lawsuit has fewer claims and asserts no federal causes of action 
the action is purportedly brought on behalf of the company  naming it as a nominal defendant and naming as defendants certain current and former officers and directors of the company 
the plaintiff alleges  among other things  that the individual defendants participated in the backdating of stock options  breached fiduciary duties  caused or allowed the company to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements  and sold company stock while in possession of material non public information 
the plaintiff seeks  among other things  unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants  certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct  the adoption of certain company corporate governance proposals  the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants stock options and proceeds  punitive damages  the rescission of certain unexercised options  and the reimbursement of litigation costs 
the plaintiff is not seeking any monetary relief from the company 
policies of directors and officers liability insurance are in force  subject to customary limits and exclusions 
the complaint is based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and leggett stock prices that we believe is flawed 
we believe this lawsuit does not take into consideration important aspects of leggett s stock option plans 
for example  the plaintiff has noted only one set of stock option grants  made on december   within what we believe to be the applicable year statute of limitations 
these option grants were made in accordance with the company s deferred compensation program  which i provided that options would be dated on the last business day of december  and ii was filed with the sec on december  setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date 
we provided plaintiff s counsel with this publicly available documentation before they dismissed the prior federal court lawsuit 
the company expects that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  operating cash flows or results of operations
