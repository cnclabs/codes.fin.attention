item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview first community corporation is a one bank holding company headquartered in lexington  south carolina 
we operate from our main office in lexington  south carolina and our full service offices are located in lexington two  forest acres  irmo  cayce west columbia  gilbert  chapin  northeast columbia  prosperity  newberry and camden 
during the second quarter of  we completed our acquisition of dekalb bankshares  inc  the holding company for the bank of camden 
the merger added one office in kershaw county located in the midlands of south carolina 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our first acquisition of another financial institution when we merged with dutchfork bancshares  inc  the holding company for newberry federal savings bank 
the merger added three offices in newberry county 
in  our college street office in newberry was consolidated with our wilson road office in newberry 
we engage in a general commercial and retail banking business characterized by personalized service and local decision making  emphasizing the banking needs of small to medium sized businesses  professional concerns and individuals 
the following discussion describes our results of operations for as compared to and compared to  and also analyzes our financial condition as of december  as compared to december  like most community banks  we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments 
a primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits  on which we pay interest 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income  or the difference between the income on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expense on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
we have included a number of tables to assist in our description of these measures 
for example  the average balances table shows the average balance during  and of each category of our assets and liabilities  as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category 
a review of this table shows that our loans typically provide higher interest yields than do other types of interest earning assets  which is why we intend to channel a substantial percentage of our earning assets into our loan portfolio 
similarly  the rate volume analysis table helps demonstrate the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities during the years shown 
we also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates  and we have included a sensitivity analysis table to help explain this 
finally  we have included a number of tables that provide detail about our investment securities  our loans  and our deposits and other borrowings 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings 
in the following section we have included a detailed discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses and the allocation of this allowance among our various categories of loans 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers 
we describe the various components of this noninterest income  as well as our noninterest expense  in the following discussion 
the discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report 

table of contents in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets and the potential threats to the solvency of investment banks and other financial institutions  the united states government has taken unprecedented actions 
on october   president bush signed into law the eesa 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury will have the authority to  among other things  purchase mortgages  mbss  and other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the us department of treasury announced the cpp under the eesa  pursuant to which the treasury could make senior preferred stock investments in participating financial institutions that qualifies as tier i capital 
based on our risk weighted assets as of september   we were eligible to issue up to approximately million in new senior preferred stock under the program 
on november   as part of the cpp established by the treasury under the eesa  first community corporation entered into the cpp purchase agreement with the treasury dated november  pursuant to which we issued and sold to the treasury i the series t preferred stock and ii the cpp warrant  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
the proceeds from this offering qualify as tier capital under the regulatory capital guidelines 
cumulative dividends on the series t preferred stock will accrue on the liquidation preference at a rate of per annum for the first five years  and at a rate of per annum thereafter  but will be paid only if  as  and when declared by the company s board of directors 
the series t preferred stock has no maturity date and ranks senior to the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation  dissolution and winding up of the company 
the series t preferred stock generally is non voting 
under the terms of the agreement the company may redeem the series t preferred stock at par after february  prior to this date  the company may redeem the series t preferred stock at par if i the company has raised aggregate gross proceeds in one or more qualified equity offerings as defined in the cpp purchase agreement in excess of approximately million  and ii the aggregate redemption price does not exceed the aggregate net proceeds from such qualified equity offerings 
the recovery act signed by the president on february  amended the terms of the agreement and allows the company to redeem the series t preferred stock prior to february  any redemption is subject to the consent of the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgment and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions we make  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgment and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
some of the more critical judgments supporting the amount of our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit worthiness of borrowers  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the assumptions about cash flow  determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses  the impact of current events  and conditions  and other factors impacting the level of probable inherent losses 

table of contents under different conditions or using different assumptions  the actual amount of credit losses incurred by us may be different from management s estimates provided in our consolidated financial statements 
refer to the portion of this discussion that addresses our allowance for loan losses for a more complete discussion of our processes and methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses 
results of operations our net loss was million  or diluted loss per share  for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december   and million  or diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  included a charge to recognize an otti in the amount of million on our investment in a preferred stock issue of freddie mac a gse reflecting a write down of substantially all of its carrying value 
during the second quarter of we made a decision to recognize an unrealized mark to market loss on this investment grade security in the amount of million as an otti based on the significant decline in the market value of the security caused by potential deterioration of freddie mac s financial condition  and the then current lack of clarity about the impact of an announced plan which was approved by the house and senate and signed into law by the president 
that plan provided support for freddie mac as well as other gses 
on september   the secretary of the treasury announced a decision to place freddie mac into conservatorship and as part of that decision the dividend payments on existing preferred shares would be terminated for an unspecified period of time 
as a result of that decision we took an additional million otti charge in the third quarter of to write off substantially all of the remaining investment in this freddie mac security 
the preferred stock issue was purchased in and acquired by first community corporation in the merger with dutchfork bankshares 
the security with a current cost basis of  is included in the available for sale securities portfolio 
another significant decision that impacted our results for the year ended december  was the implementation of a leverage strategy  during the second quarter of  whereby we acquired approximately million in certain non agency mbss and cmos 
we initiated this strategy because we believe the pricing levels of these securities and related funding opportunities provided the ability to realize significant spread not typically available in leverage strategies 
the weighted average yield on the investment securities purchased was approximately 
all of the mortgage assets acquired were classified as prime or alt a securities and represent the senior or super senior tranches of the securities 
the assets acquired as part of this strategy have been classified as held to maturity in the investment portfolio 
the securities were acquired on the open market through securities dealers 
prior to initiating each transaction  we performed a thorough analysis  evaluating the associated credit risk  interest rate risk  liquidity and capital risk as well as related funding options 
we continue to perform an evaluation of these securities and the related risk on a monthly basis 
the funding for this strategy was provided through federal home loan bank advances in the amount of million and brokered certificate of deposits in the amount of million 
the weighted average cost of funding was approximately 
we believe this opportunity existed as a result of the ongoing volatility in this market sector and the economic value of these securities was not reflected at the pricing levels 
as noted above under reconciliations  our operating earnings were million  or per diluted common share  for as compared to million  or diluted earnings per common share  for net interest income increased by million in from million in to million in the increase in net interest income is primarily due to the increase in the level of average earning assets resulting from the implementation of the leverage strategy discussed previously as well as core internal growth 
average earning assets equaled million during as compared to million during the effect of the increase in earning assets was offset by a basis point decrease in the net interest margin from during to during on a tax equivalent basis

the provision for loan losses was million in as compared to  in non interest income  excluding the otti charge was million in as compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to a negative fair value adjustment on interest rate contracts of  in as compared to a positive adjustment of  in non interest expense increased to million in as compared to million in this increase is attributable to increases in salary and benefit expense  an increase in fdic fico premiums as well as the impact of our share of accumulated losses in a limited partnership designed to assist rehabilitate certain low income housing projects

our net income was million  or diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december  the increase in net income for as compared to resulted primarily from an increase in the level of average earning assets of million 
the effect of the increase in earning assets was offset by a basis point decrease in the net interest margin from during to during on a tax equivalent basis  the net interest margin was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net interest spread  the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was in as compared to in net interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the provision for loan losses was  in as compared to  in non interest income increased to million in from million in due primarily to increased deposit service charges resulting from higher average deposit account balances as well as increased atm debit card fees and a favorable adjustment on financial instruments that are carried at fair value 
non interest expense increased to million in as compared to million in this increase is attributable to increases in all expense categories required to support the continued growth of the bank 
net interest income net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
net interest income is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets 
net interest income is determined by the rates earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income totaled million in  million in and million in the yield on earning assets  which was in  as compared to and in and  respectively 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was in  in and in the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was in  in and in our loan to deposit ratio on average during was  as compared to in and during loans typically provide a higher yield than other types of earning assets and thus one of our goals continues to be to grow the loan portfolio as a percentage of earning assets which should improve the overall yield on earning assets and the net interest margin 
at december   the loan to deposit ratio had increased to 
the net interest margin declined in as compared to primarily as a result of declining interest rates during this economic cycle 
with interest rates as low as they became throughout 
table of contents certain deposit products could not be repriced in the same magnitude as the general decline in interest rates 
in addition  the leverage strategy discussed above did not provide the interest rate spread typically achieved in funding core loan growth with core deposit growth 
the yield on earning assets decreased by basis points and the cost of funds decreased by basis points 
this resulted in an increase in our net interest spread of basis points in as compared to despite this our net interest margin decreased basis points as a higher percentage of our average earning assets volume were funded by interest bearing liabilities volume in as compared to the average borrowed funds to total interest bearing liabilities was in as compared to in during the fhlb advance funding cost were favorable compared to local certificate of deposit funding 
the flat yield curve throughout much the first half of as well as an increasing competitive deposit and lending environment were significant contributors to the decline in the net interest margin in as compared to the yield on earning assets increased by basis points in as compared to  whereas the cost of interest bearing funds increased by basis points during the same period 
the higher increase in the cost of funds as compared to yield on interest earning assets was due to an increase in our funding cost on time deposits 
the short end of the yield curve declined in the latter half of but the competitive pricing environment within our market kept rates on these deposits high in comparison to the yield curve decline 
the average cost of time deposits was in as compared to in the average borrowed funds to total interest bearing liabilities in was  as compared to in longer term borrowed funds typically have a higher interest rate than our mix of deposit products 
our average cost of borrowed funds for was as compared to in average balances  income expenses and rates 
the following tables depict  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average balance sheet and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average

the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume and the amount attributable to changes in rate

the risk of loss can be measured in either diminished current market values or reduced current and potential net income 
our primary market risk is interest rate risk 
we have established an asset liability management committee alco to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
the alco monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on our net interest income 
the alco has established policies guidelines and strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity 
a monitoring technique employed by us is the measurement of our interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
also  asset liability modeling is performed to assess the impact varying interest rates and balance sheet mix assumptions will have on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
neither the gap analysis or asset liability modeling are precise indicators of our interest sensitivity position due to the many factors that affect net interest income including  the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

securities based on amortized cost 
at december   we had an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million 
the cap rate of interest is three month libor 
the cap agreement expires on august  and at december  the agreement had no value 
at december  the company had a cap and floor with a notional amount of million 
the floor was sold in the first quarter of and the company received  in cash and recognized a gain in the amount of  in other income 
these agreements are entered into to protect assets and liabilities from the negative effects of volatility in interest rates 
the agreements provide for a payment to the bank of the difference between the cap floor rate of interest and the market rate of interest 
the bank s exposure to credit risk is limited to the ability of the counterparty to make potential future payments required pursuant to the agreement 
the bank s exposure to market risk of loss is limited to the market value of the cap and floor 
the market value of the cap was  and the floor market value was  at december  any gain or loss on the value of these contracts are recognized in earnings on a current basis 
the bank received payments under the terms of the cap contract in the amount   and  during the year ended december   and  respectively 
no payments were received under the terms of the floor contract in and the bank recognized   and  and in other income to reflect the increase in the value of the contracts for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents we entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement on october  the swap agreement has a million notional amount 
we will receive a variable rate of interest on the notional amount based on a three month libor rate and pay a fixed rate interest of 
the contract was entered into to protect us from the negative impact of rising interest rates 
our exposure to credit risk is limited to the ability of the counterparty to make potential future payments required pursuant to the agreement 
our exposure to market risk of loss is limited to the changes in the market value of the swap between reporting periods 
at december  the fair value of the contract was a negative  the fair value adjustment of  was recognized in other income for the year ended december  the fair value of the contract is the present value  over the remaining term of the contract  of the difference between the five year swap rate at the reporting date multiplied by the notional amount and the fixed interest rate of multiplied by the notional amount of the contract 
through simulation modeling  we monitor the effect that an immediate and sustained change in interest rates of basis points and basis points up and down will have on net interest income over the next months 
based on the many factors and assumptions used in simulating the effect of changes in interest rates  the following table estimates the hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at december  and over the subsequent months 
even though we are liability sensitive the model at december  reflects a decrease in net interest income in a basis point declining rate environment 
this primarily results from the current level of interest rates being paid on our interest bearing transaction accounts as well as money market accounts 
the interest rates on these accounts are at a level where they cannot be repriced in proportion to the change in interest rates 
the increase and decrease of and basis points assume a simultaneous and parallel change in interest rates along the entire yield curve 
net interest income sensitivity hypothetical percentage change in net interest income december  change in short term interest rates bp bp flat bp bp we also perform a valuation analysis projecting future cash flows from assets and liabilities to determine the present value of equity pve over a range of changes in market interest rates 
the sensitivity of pve to changes in interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of earnings over a longer time horizon 
at december  and  the pve exposure in a plus basis point increase in market interest rates was estimated to be and  respectively 
the increase in the pve exposure in as compared to was impacted by the leverage transaction that we implemented in early as rates rise prepayments on the underlying mortgages slow and the life of the securities extend 
in evaluating the leverage strategy we believe that the spreads realized on the overall transaction adequately compensated us for the additional exposure in a rising rate environment 
provision and allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans  as compared to million  or of total loans  at december  our provision for loan loss was million for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision is made based on our assessment of general loan loss risk and asset quality 
the allowance for loan losses represents an 
table of contents amount which we believe will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a number of assumptions about future events  which we believe to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove to be accurate 
our determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans  including consideration of factors such as the balance of impaired loans  the quality  mix  and size of our overall loan portfolio  economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the amount and quality of collateral securing the loans  our historical loan loss experience  and a review of specific problem loans 
we also consider subjective issues such as changes in the lending policies and procedures  changes in the local national economy  changes in volume or type of credits  changes in volume severity of problem loans  quality of loan review and board of director oversight and concentrations of credit 
periodically  we adjust the amount of the allowance based on changing circumstances 
we charge recognized losses to the allowance and add subsequent recoveries back to the allowance for loan losses 
there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses as estimated at any point in time or that provisions for loan losses will not be significant to a particular accounting period  especially considering the overall weakness in the commercial real estate market in our market areas 
we perform an analysis quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio 
the portfolio is segregated into similar risk components for which historical loss ratios are calculated and adjusted for identified changes in current portfolio characteristics 
historical loss ratios are calculated by product type and by regulatory credit risk classification 
the allowance consists of an allocated and unallocated allowance 
the allocated portion is determined by types and ratings of loans within the portfolio 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is established for losses that exist in the remainder of the portfolio and compensates for uncertainty in estimating the loan losses 
the substantial increase in the provision for as compared to the prior two years is a direct result of the ongoing economic downturn experienced throughout our markets and the country 
real estate values have been dramatically impacted during this economic cycle 
with our loan portfolio consisting of a large percentage of real estate secured loans we  like most financial institutions  have experienced increasing delinquencies and problem loans 
we are not immune to the effects of the slowing economy and see some deterioration of our loan portfolio in general as evidenced by the increase in non performing assets from million basis points at december  to million basis points at december  while these rates we believe are favorable in comparison to current industry results  we are concerned about the impact of this economic environment on our customer base of local businesses and professionals 
during this economic cycle acquisition and development a d loans have been a major concern for financial institutions 
currently  our company has million of a d loans in our portfolio which represents of our total loan portfolio 
we have identified two of these as potential problem loans and discuss them below 
we will continue to work closely with all our borrowers that are experiencing economic problems as a result of this cycle and believe we have the processes in place to monitor and identify problem credits 
until this economic cycle begins to reverse we are likely to experience higher delinquencies and problem loans 
therefore  we anticipate funding our provision for loan losses at levels higher than we have historically experienced 
there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses as estimated at any point in time or that provisions for loan losses will not be significant to a particular accounting period 
the allowance is also subject to examination and testing for adequacy by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions 
such regulatory agencies could require us to adjust our allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
at december    and  we had non accrual loans in the amount of million   and  respectively 
nonaccrual loans at december  consisted of loans 
the loans range in the amount of  to  and are substantially all real estate related 
we have 
table of contents reappraised the collateral on each of these loans and have written them down to their estimated fair value 
it is not anticipated that we will incur any material losses on these loans 
there were million   and million in loans delinquent to days at december   and  respectively 
there were   and  in loans greater than days delinquent and still accruing interest at december   and  respectively 
our management continuously monitors non performing  classified and past due loans to identify deterioration regarding the condition of these loans 
we identified loans in the amount of million which are current as to principal and interest at december  and not included in non performing assets but that could be potential problem loans 
of these  we have identified two a d loans as potential problem loans 
both are located within the midlands of south carolina 
one in the amount of million was not yet days delinquent at december   but became days past due during the first quarter of we continued to work with the borrower  but subsequent to year end the loan was placed into non performing status 
we are currently obtaining and evaluating an updated appraisal on the property 
the second loan is in the amount of million and we do not currently anticipate any loss associated with this specific loan 
the balance of loans considered to be potential problem loans consist of two single family home loans totaling million and one loan on land totaling  these loans are continually monitored and are considered in our overall evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses

table of contents the following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the end of each of the past four years 
the allocation is calculated on an approximate basis and is not necessarily indicative of future losses or allocations

a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
at the time a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest  which has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income 
our primary source of noninterest income is service charges on deposit accounts 
in addition  we originate mortgage loans that are pre sold and funded by the third party acquirer  for which we receive a fee 
other sources of noninterest income are derived from commissions on sale of non deposit investment products  bankcard fees  atm debit card fees  commissions on check sales  safe deposit box rent  wire transfer and official check fees 
as a result of the otti charge  discussed previously  we had a non interest income loss during of million 
operating non interest income see reconciliation above during was million as compared to million during the same period in during  we realized losses on fair value adjustments on interest rate contracts in the amount of  as compared to gains of  in the same period of deposit service charges decreased by  in as compared to this decrease in deposit service charges results from a decline in overdraft fees in as compared to there was a noticeable decrease of these fees in the fourth quarter of it appears that during this period customers were cutting back on their spending and the result was fewer items were being presented for payment 
mortgage origination fees increased  or in the as compared to the same period in this increase results from a continued emphasis on this source of revenue  the continuing favorable mortgage interest rate environment as well as a fewer number of mortgage origination alternatives in the market place 
other non interest income increased by  in as compared to the increase primarily related to continued increases in atm surcharge and debit card exchange fees as a result of continued increased usage by our customer base 
the fees received on sale of non deposit investment products decreased by  in as compared to on september   we completed the acquisition of two financial planning and investment advisory firms 
these firms had combined assets under management of approximately million 
this 
table of contents new division  first community financial consultants  combines the investment services unit already in place at first community with the added capabilities of holistic financial planning and investment advisory services 
this line of business is consistent with our vision to be a provider of financial solutions to local businesses  entrepreneurs  and professionals 
the activity in this division was slowed in the fourth quarter as we integrated the acquisition of two firms 
we believe that over time this business will provide a consistent non interest income revenue stream 
noninterest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for  an increase of  or 
deposit service charges increased from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to increased deposit service charges resulting from higher average deposit account balances as well as certain adjustments in our deposit service charge fees during mortgage origination fees as well as commissions on the sale of non deposit products were relatively stable between as compared to during  we sold securities in the amount of million that resulted in net gains of  we sold the investments in to restructure certain investments within the portfolio that had small balances or relatively short maturities 
the funds received were used to pay down overnight advances and purchase other securities with a longer maturity 
in the first quarter of  we sold securities that resulted in a loss of  the proceeds from the sale of the securities were used to pay down million in fhlb advances resulting in a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of  we had favorable adjustments in financial instruments carried at fair value of  in as compared to  in other non interest income increased  from million in to million in this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in atm debit card fees of  atm debit card fees were  in as compared to  in noninterest expense 
in the very competitive financial services industry  we recognize the need to place a great deal of emphasis on expense management and continually evaluate and monitor growth in discretionary expense categories in order to control future increases 
over the last five years we have expanded our branch network and completed two acquisitions 
the first acquisition was completed in october when we acquired dutchfork bancshares located in newberry  south carolina 
the second acquisition was completed in june when we acquired dekalb bankshares in camden  south carolina 
in july  construction was completed and we occupied our new  square foot administrative center 
as a result of management s expansion strategy and the move into the new administrative center all categories of non interest expense have continued to increase over the last several years 
non interest expense increased to million in as compared to million in this increase of million is primarily attributable to increases in salary and benefit expense of  an increase in fdic fico premiums of  increased marketing expenses of  as well as a loss of  on our share of accumulated losses in a limited partnership designed to assist in rehabilitating certain low income housing projects 
we entered into this partnership to assist in meeting our commitment to the cra 
the anticipated loss on the partnership for is approximately  during  we added approximately full time equivalent employees and as of december  we had ftes 
these additions were support personnel in audit  information technology  deposit sales  training and loan operations 
in addition the acquisition of the two investment firms in the third quarter added three employees 
marketing expenses increased as a result of planned increases in television marketing in as compared to amortization of intangibles decreased approximately  which resulted from the core deposit premium associated with the acquisition of a branch office in ending in february of in  we had a credit toward fdic premiums as a result of our dutchfork acquisition in this credit ran out in march of and thereafter we were assessed the full fee 
the fdic has proposed substantial increases in deposit premiums for as compared to it is anticipated that these premiums will increase by  to  in based on our current deposit base 

table of contents recently the fdic has proposed a one time special assessment for all depository institutions to be assessed as of march  and paid june  the special assessment may be as much as basis points on insured deposits 
this assessment would amount to approximately  based on our december  deposits 
professional fees increased by  in as compared to this primarily results from legal fees associated with increased collection efforts as well as legal fees related securities issues and new legislation 
the securities and exchange commission has granted an extension for the independent attestation report on internal controls until december  there will be increased cost incurred relative to complying with the requirements of section into and beyond 
the independent attestation report required for is anticipated to increase our professional fees by  to  in in addition  institutions participating in the cpp program are subject to additional legislation as it relates to compensation  policy requirements  and other initiatives 
it is anticipated the cost of professional fees to monitor and comply with this legislation will also increase professional fees in as compared to during the fourth quarter of and first quarter we introduced two initiatives that impacted the results 
we began to hire additional personnel specifically retail bankers in many of our offices to increase our lending capacity and to continue to focus on core deposit growth 
in addition  in december we engaged a consulting firm to assist in identifying process efficiency improvements  expense control opportunities and non interest income enhancements 
noninterest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  salary and employee benefits increased  in as compared to we added approximately employees in connection with the merger with dekalb 
these employees were included in operations for a full year in and approximately seven months during in the last quarter of  as part of the initiatives discussed in the previous paragraph  we hired five additional retail bankers within the branch offices 
these positions along with the employees that were retained as a result of the dekalb merger are the primary reason for the increase in salary and benefits in as compared to occupancy expense increased  from  in to million in the increase is primarily a result of the increased expense associated with the administrative center and the camden branch being included for the entire year of  whereas they were included for only five months and seven months respectively in marketing expenses increased  in as compared to this increase is a result of increasing the amount of television advertising in our markets in as compared to previous years 
atm debit card processing costs are primarily associated with a third party processor supporting our network of atm machines as well as processing atm and debit card activity 
the expense related to these activities increased  as a result of the increased activity and numbers of outstanding cards 
supplies and telephone expense decreased by  and  primarily as a result of some one time charges incurred in relative to our acquisition of the bank of camden 
professional fees increased from  in to  in the increase results primarily from the cost of the consulting engagement discussed previously 

table of contents the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the primary components of non interest expense year ended december  in thousands salary and employee benefits occupancy equipment marketing and public relations atm debit card processing supplies telephone courier correspondent services fdic fico premium insurance professional fees loss on limited partnership interest postage director fees amortization of intangibles other income tax expense income tax benefit for was million as compared to income tax expense for the year ended december  of million and million for the year ended december  we recognize deferred tax assets for future deductible amounts resulting from differences in the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is then established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the level that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized 
in  we established a deferred tax valuation allowance of  primarily related to contribution carryforwards that will expire at the end of there were no valuation allowances established for deferred taxes as of december  and as previously discussed we had an otti charge on certain securities of million during the loss is not deductible for federal income tax purposes until the securities are sold are deemed worthless 
therefore  the loss resulted in recognizing a deferred tax asset in the amount of million 
the net operating loss carryforward period for federal income taxes is generally years 
any carry forward period related to realized tax losses on these securities will not start until they are sold or deemed worthless 
we have a net operating loss carry forward acquired in the acquisition of dutchfork and dekalb for federal income tax purposes of approximately million to offset future taxable income through financial position total assets at december  were million as compared to million at december  average earning assets increased to million during from million during asset growth included growth in loans of million during loans at december  were million as compared to million at december  investment securities were at december  as compared to million at december  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell decreased by million at december  as compared to december  the increase in loans was primarily funded by the decrease in federal funds sold and an increase in federal home loan bank 
table of contents advances 
federal home loan bank advances  excluding those carried at fair value  increased million of which million was used to fund the leverage strategy noted below 
during the second quarter of we implemented a leverage strategy whereby we acquired approximately million in certain non agency mbss and cmos 
the weighted average yield on the investment securities purchased was approximately 
all of the mortgage assets acquired were classified as prime or alt a securities and represent the senior or super senior tranches of the securities 
the assets acquired as part of this strategy were classified as held to maturity in the investment portfolio 
prior to initiating each transaction  we performed a thorough analysis  evaluating the associated credit risk  interest rate risk  liquidity and capital risk as well as related funding options 
the funding for this strategy was provided through federal home loan bank advances in the amount of million and brokered certificate of deposits in the amount of million 
the certificates of deposits have a call option whereby we have the option to call them on a quarterly basis 
the weighted average cost of funding was approximately 
shareholders equity totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  as previously discussed we incurred an otti charge in which was the primary contributor to our recording a net loss for the year of million for the net loss along with dividend payments and an accumulated accounting adjustment resulted in retained earnings decreasing to million as of december  as compared to million at december  as a result of the net loss for we elected to participate in the treasury cpp authorized under the eesa 
under this program we issued and sold to the treasury the series t preferred stock and the cpp warrant  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
effective january  we adopted the provisions of eitf  accounting for the deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements eitf 
the cumulative adjustment reduced retained earnings in the amount of  earning assets loans 
loans typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
during  loans accounted for of average earning assets as compared to of average earning assets in the decrease in the ratio during is primarily a result of the implementation of the securities leverage strategy implemented in the second quarter of the growth of the loan portfolio both in total dollars and as a percentage of total earning assets is a major focus into and thereafter 
associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks  which we attempt to control and counterbalance 
loans averaged million during  as compared to million in a goal of the cpp program was to provide funds capital to financial institutions to assist in unfreezing the credit markets 
one of our goals as a community bank has  and continues to be  to grow our assets through quality loan growth by providing credit to small and mid size businesses  as well as  individuals within the markets we serve 
in  we funded new loans in the amount of million 
in  our loan portfolio grew by approximately million 
future loan production and portfolio growth rates will be impacted by the current economic recession  as borrowers may be less inclined to leverage their corporate and personal balance sheets 
however  we remain committed to meeting the credit needs of our local markets 
as with any capital raised by the company our goal is to leverage it to the extent that we are providing an appropriate return to the constituencies primarily shareholders and customers we serve 
ultimately we would anticipate leveraging this capital at a level of ten to twelve times 
since growing the loan portfolio is the primary way we leverage the various sources of funding  including capital  we would anticipate that ultimately the cpp funds could provide the ability to grow the portfolio by million x to million x 
this will obviously take a number of years to accomplish 
events that could negatively impact this goal are continued deteriorating national and local economic conditions as well as deteriorating asset quality within our company 
if and when these events impact our earnings  our ability to grow the capital base will be 
table of contents impacted and will result in reducing our ability to grow our balance sheet and expand the loan portfolio 
other events that will prevent us from fully leveraging these funds include regulatory changes such as  but not limited to  raising the required regulatory capital ratios as well as a recent proposal to significantly increase in the fdic assessments 
the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio by category december  in thousands commercial  financial agricultural real estate construction mortgage residential mortgage commercial consumer total gross loans allowance for loan losses total net loans in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
we follow the common practice of financial institutions in the company s market area of obtaining a security interest in real estate whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan components 
generally  we limit the loan to value ratio to 
the principal components of our loan portfolio at year end and were commercial mortgage loans in the amount of million and million  representing and of the portfolio  respectively 
significant portions of these commercial mortgage loans are made to finance owner occupied real estate 
we continue to maintain a conservative philosophy regarding our underwriting guidelines  and believe it will reduce the risk elements of the loan portfolio through strategies that diversify the lending mix 
the repayment of loans in the loan portfolio as they mature is a source of liquidity 
the following table sets forth the loans maturing within specified intervals at december  loan maturity schedule and sensitivity to changes in interest rates december  in thousands one year or less over one year through five years over five years total commercial  financial agricultural real estate construction all other loan loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates floating interest rates the information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity

table of contents of such loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio is a significant component of our total earning assets 
total securities averaged million in  as compared to million in this represents and of the average earning assets for the year ended december  and  respectively 
at december  and our investment securities portfolio amounted to million and million during the last half of and throughout the bond markets and many institutional holders of bonds came under a great deal of stress partially as a result of increasing delinquencies in the sub prime mortgage lending market 
we own total mbss and cmos with a book value of million and an approximate fair value of million 
these included securities with a book value million and approximate fair value of million issued by gses 
current economic conditions have impacted mbss issued by gses such as fhlmc and fnma 
the result has been increased spreads on these investments 
these entities have also experienced increasing delinquencies in the underlying loans that make up the mbss and cmos 
as of december  and all of the mbss issued by gses are classified as available for sale 
unrealized losses on these investments are not considered to be other than temporary and we have the intent and ability to hold these until they mature or recover the current book value 
the contractual cash flows of the investments are guaranteed by the gse 
accordingly  it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the our amortized cost 
also included in our mbs and cmo portfolio are privately issued mbss at december  with a book value of million and approximate fair value of million 
although these are not classified as sub prime obligations or considered the high risk tranches  the majority of structured investments within all credit markets have been impacted by volatility and credit concerns and economic stresses throughout the result has been that the market for these investments has become less liquid and the spread as compared to alternative investments has widened dramatically 
during the second quarter of the company implemented a leverage strategy whereby we acquired approximately million in certain non agency mbss and cmos 
all of the mortgage assets acquired in this transaction were classified as prime or alt a securities and represent the senior or super senior tranches of the securities 
the assets acquired as part of this strategy were classified as held to maturity in the investment portfolio 
due to the significant spreads on these securities they were all purchased at discounts 
a detailed analysis of each of the cmo pools included in this leverage transaction as well as privately held cmos held previously in the available for sale portfolio have been analyzed by reviewing underlying loan delinquencies  collateral value and resulting credit support 
as of december  we have not identified any cmos that we believe have probable losses as a result of credit defaults 
these securities have continued to experience increasing delinquencies in the underlying loans that make up the mbss and cmos 
we monitor each of these pools on a quarterly basis to identify any deterioration in the credit quality  collateral values and credit support underlying the investments 
it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than our amortized cost 
we also hold corporate bonds and other securities with a book value of million and fair value of million 
the unrealized loss on investments in corporate bonds relates to bonds with seven different issuers 
the economic conditions throughout have had a significant impact on all corporate debt obligations 
as a result  the spreads on all of these securities have widened dramatically and the liquidity of many of these investments has been negatively impacted 
each of these bonds is rated a or better s p with the exception of two bonds downgraded during the last twelve months 
one downgraded investment is rated b by moody s and a by fitch and is a preferred term security with a book value of million and fair value of  the second bond is a collateralized debt 
table of contents obligation cdo  rated b by s p  with a carrying value of  and fair value of  this bond matures in december all of the corporate bonds held by the company are reviewed on a quarterly basis to identify downgrades by rating agencies as well as deterioration of the underlying collateral or in the issuer s ability to service the debt obligation 
we have developed a policy evaluating potential for otti as it relates to our private issue mbs cmo and corporate debt portfolios 
many privately issued mbss and cmos  including certain bonds held in our portfolio  have incurred rating agency downgrades 
the ratings applied to an issue do not consider what an individual holder paid for the security 
if the security was purchased at a discount and our projected yield at the time of purchase considered the potential for future credit losses then the fact that the security was downgraded does not in itself deem it to be otti 
for mbss and cmos we review the projected cash flows under varying stress scenarios 
if potential credit losses are projected we then compare these to our original yield analysis and our current carrying value 
if these losses do not exceed an amount that would result in us receiving an amount less than our current carrying value and a yield less than projected at purchase  we do not deem the security to be otti 
for corporate debt securities we review the underlying issuer s credit quality  additional underlying credit support  and the length of maturity of the bond 
if our analysis determines that it is likely we will recover all of the projected cash flows we do not deem the security to be otti 
during the year ended we took an otti charge related to certain securities including million on fhlmc preferred stock see results of operations  and  on a privately issued mbs 
at december   the estimated weighted average life of the portfolio was years  duration of approximately years  and a weighted average tax equivalent yield of approximately 
based on our evaluation of securities that currently have unrealized losses  and our ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  we do not consider any of the investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the following table shows the investment portfolio composition

core deposits were million and million at december  and  respectively 
included in time deposits less than  are brokered deposits of million 
these deposits are not considered core 
as previously discussed we partially funded the leverage transaction with million in brokered cds 
all of these brokered cds are callable by us on a quarterly basis 
although we paid a slightly higher cost on these deposits it gives us the flexibility to call the cds in the event the asset side of the transaction prepays faster than anticipated as well as the ability to refinance them if rates decline 
a stable base of deposits is expected to continue be the primary source of funding to meet both our short term and long term liquidity needs in the future 
the maturity distribution of time deposits is shown in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposit of  or more december  in thousands within three months after three through months after six through twelve months after twelve months total certificates of deposit of  or more there were no other time deposits of  or more at december  large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposits obtained through brokers 
except for the leverage transaction previously discussed we have not funded our balance sheet by utilizing brokered deposits since they can be unreliable as long term funding sources 
borrowed funds 
borrowed funds consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal home loan bank advances and long term debt as a result of issuing million in trust preferred securities

the proceeds from this offering qualify as tier capital under the regulatory capital guidelines 
cumulative dividends on the series t preferred stock will accrue on the liquidation preference at a rate of per annum for the first five years  and at a rate of per annum thereafter  but will be paid only if  as  and when declared by the board of directors 
the series t preferred stock has no maturity date and ranks senior to the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation  dissolution and winding up of the company 
the series t preferred stock generally is non voting 
under the terms of the agreement we may redeem the series t preferred stock at par after february  prior to this date  we may redeem the series t preferred stock at par if i we raise aggregate gross proceeds in one or more qualified equity offerings as defined in the cpp purchase agreement in excess of approximately million  and ii the aggregate redemption price does not exceed the aggregate net proceeds from such qualified equity offerings 
the recovery act signed by the president on february  amended the terms of the agreement and allows us to redeem the series t preferred stock prior to february  any redemption is subject to the consent of the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
under the capital guidelines of the federal reserve and the occ  the company and the bank are currently required to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio of  with at least being tier capital 
tier capital consists of common shareholders equity  qualifying perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
in addition  the bank must maintain a minimum tier leverage ratio tier capital to total assets of at least  but this minimum ratio is increased by to basis points for other than the highest rated institutions 
the trust preferred securities in the amount of million that were issued on september  qualify as tier capital under the regulatory guidelines and are included in the amounts reflected below 
the company and the bank exceeded their regulatory capital ratios at december  and  as set forth in the following table

liquidity represents our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable  or which can be pledged  or which will mature in the near future 
liability liquidity is provided by access to core funding sources  principally the ability to generate customer deposits in our market area 
in addition  liability liquidity is provided through the ability to borrow against approved lines of credit federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and to borrow on a secured basis through securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the bank is a member of the fhlb atlanta and has the ability to obtain advances for various periods of time 
these advances are secured by securities pledged by the bank or assignment of loans within the bank s portfolio 
with the successful completion of the common stock offering in  the secondary offering completed in  the trust preferred offering completed in september  the acquisition of dutchfork in october  the acquisition of dekalb in june and the preferred stock offering under the cpp program in november we have maintained a high level of liquidity and adequate capital along with retained earnings less the net loss  sufficient to fund the operations of the bank 
table of contents for at least the next months 
we anticipate that the bank will remain a well capitalized institution for at least the next months 
total shareholders equity was of total assets at december  and at december  funds sold and short term interest bearing deposits are our primary source of liquidity and averaged million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively 
the bank maintains federal funds purchased lines  in the amount of million each with two financial institutions  although these were not utilized in the fhlb atlanta has approved a line of credit of up to of the bank assets  which would be collateralized by a pledge against specific investment securities and or eligible loans 
we regularly review the liquidity position of the company and have implemented internal policies establishing guidelines for sources of asset based liquidity and limit the total amount of purchased funds used to support the balance sheet and funding from non core sources 
we believe that our existing stable base of core deposits along with continued growth in this deposit base will enable us to meet our long term liquidity needs successfully 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with gaap  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by the company for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
please refer to note of the company s financial statements for a discussion of our off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the company and the bank are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  we continually seek to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
