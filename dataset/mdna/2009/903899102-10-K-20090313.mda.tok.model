results of operations twelve months ended december  compared with the twelve months ended december  months ended increase decrease revenues cost of products sold gross margin operating and other expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income before taxes income tax provision net income net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic weighted average shares outstanding diluted revenues 
total revenues for the twelve months ended december  amounted to  an increase of  or from the  reported for the twelve months ended december  non rechargeable product sales decreased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the decrease in non rechargeable revenues was mainly attributable to the non recurrence in of the fulfillment of battery orders to international defense customers that occurred in offsetting this decrease  in part  were increases in ba and other military battery sales  as well as higher sales of backup battery systems for automotive telematics customers 
rechargeable product revenues increased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the increase in rechargeable revenues was mainly attributable to higher sales of lithium ion battery packs and charging systems primarily to government defense customers 
communications systems revenues increased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the increase in communications systems revenues was mainly attributable to deliveries of satcom on the move and other advanced communications systems related to the sizeable orders we received during the latter part of design and installation services revenues increased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the increase in design and installation services revenues was mainly attributable to the full year impact of the acquisitions of redblack and stationary power that were completed in the second half of  as well as the acquisition of use in november cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the increase in revenues 
consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue decreased from for the twelve months ended december  to for the year ended december  correspondingly  consolidated gross margins was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december   generally attributable to higher sales and production volumes and a more favorable sales mix of higher margin products 

table of contents in our non rechargeable products segment  the cost of products sold decreased  from  in the year ended december  to  in non rechargeable gross margin for was  or  a decrease of  from s gross margin of  or 
non rechargeable gross margin declined primarily as a result of lower overhead absorption from lower sales volumes  an unfavorable product shift which was partially impacted by lower margin telematics products  and higher costs of raw materials related to increasing energy and transportation costs 
the decrease was also attributable to the costs incurred to transition our uk manufacturing and assembly operation to a distribution and service center  including a second quarter restructuring charge of approximately for employee termination costs and certain asset valuation adjustments 
in our rechargeable products segment  the cost of products sold increased  from  in to  in rechargeable gross margin for was  or  an increase of  from s gross margin of  or 
the decrease in rechargeable gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to an increase in component costs  acceptance of lower margin projects to develop new customers and product mix 
in our communications systems segment  the cost of products sold increased  from  in to  in communications systems gross margin for was  or  an increase of  from s gross margin of  or 
the increase in the communications systems gross margin primarily resulted from higher overall sales  production volumes and a favorable product mix  as well as improvements in our supply chain management and lower material costs 
in our design and installation services segment  the cost of sales increased  from  for the year ended december   to  in design and installation services gross margin for was  or  compared to s gross margin of  or 
the gross margin percentage in this particular segment declined in due primarily to investments we are making and associated start up costs to grow this segment  including the addition of new sales service centers and certain integration costs associated with the acquisition of use 
previous to the acquisitions of redblack and stationary power  this segment was comprised mainly of technology contracts which had varying margins dependent on the progress of individual contracts 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  overall  operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from reported the prior year  as we were able to leverage our operating expense base against the increase in revenues 
amortization expense associated with intangible assets related to our acquisitions was  for  in selling  general and administrative expenses and in research and development costs  compared with  for  in selling  general  and administrative expenses and  in research and development costs 
research and development costs were  in  an increase of  or  over the  reported in this increase was mainly due to an increase in overall product development and design activity 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased  or  to  this increase was comprised of approximately  associated with costs related to acquired companies  in addition to higher sales based commissions  enhanced sales and marketing efforts and higher administrative costs required to operate a more diverse organization 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  interest expense  net of interest income  decreased  from  for to for  mainly as a result of the conversion  in the first quarter of  of convertible notes into shares of common stock related to the mcdowell acquisition  as well as lower borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in  we recognized a gain of on the early conversion of the  convertible notes held by the sellers of mcdowell  which related to an increase in the interest rate on the notes from to in october in  we recorded a gain on the mcdowell settlement of  as a result of a negotiated reduction in the purchase price that was finalized in november see note for additional information 
miscellaneous income expense amounted to income of for compared with income of for this income was primarily due to the recognition of in grant revenue from the satisfaction of all the requirements from a government grant in and the transactions impacted by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
income taxes 
we reflected a tax provision of  for the twelve month period ended december  compared with in the same period of the tax provision included an approximate  non cash charge to record a deferred tax liability for liabilities generated from book tax differences pertaining to goodwill and certain intangible assets that cannot be predicted to reverse during our loss carryforward periods 
substantially all of this adjustment related to book tax differences that occurred during and were identified during the second quarter of in connection with this adjustment  we reviewed the illustrative list of qualitative considerations provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and other qualitative factors in our determination that this adjustment was not material to the consolidated financial statements or this annual report on form k 
the effective consolidated tax rate for 
table of contents the twelve month period ended december  was compared with for the same period in since we have significant net operating loss carryforwards from our us and us operations  the cash outlay for income taxes is limited to the alternative minimum tax in in the us and nominal for quite some time into the future in the uk the cash outlay for the alternative minimum tax in the uk is due to the fact that certain of our nol carryforwards are subject to us alternative minimum tax limitation  such that carryforwards can offset only of alternative minimum taxable income 
during the fiscal quarter ended december   we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset  due to the determination  at that time  that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize our us and us net operating loss carryforwards nol s that had accumulated over time 
at december   we continue to recognize a valuation allowance on our us deferred tax asset  to the extent that we believe  that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize that portion of our us nol s that had accumulated over time 
a us valuation allowance is not required for the portion of the deferred tax asset that will be realized by the reversal of temporary differences related to deferred tax liabilities to the extent those temporary differences are expected to reverse in our carryforward period 
at december   we continue to recognize a full valuation allowance on our uk net deferred tax asset  as we believe  at this time  that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize our uk nol s that had accumulated over time 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we continually monitor the assumptions and performance results to assess the realizability of the tax benefits of the us and us nol s and other deferred tax assets  in accordance with the accounting standards 
we have determined that a change in ownership  as defined under internal revenue code section  occurred in and as such  the domestic nol carryforward will be subject to an annual limitation estimated to be in the range of approximately  to  the unused portion of the annual limitation can be carried forward to subsequent periods 
our ability to utilize nol carryforwards due to the successive ownership changes is currently limited to a minimum of approximately  annually  plus the carryover from unused portions of the annual limitations 
we believe such limitation will not impact our ability to realize the deferred tax asset 
in addition  certain of our nol carryforwards are subject to us alternative minimum tax such that carryforwards can offset only of alternative minimum taxable income 
this limitation did not have an impact on income taxes determined for however  this limitation does have an impact of on income taxes determined for the use of our uk nol carryforwards may be limited due to the change in the uk operation during from a manufacturing and assembly center to primarily a distribution and service center

net income 
net income and earnings per diluted share were  and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to net income and earnings per diluted share of  and  respectively  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the reasons described above 
average common shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share increased from  in to  in  mainly due to the  share issuance in the fourth quarter of from our limited public offering  conversion of the mcdowell convertible notes into  shares of our common stock during the first quarter of  stock option and warrant exercises  restricted stock grants  and potentially dilutive shares from unexercised options and convertible notes 

table of contents twelve months ended december  compared with the twelve months ended december  months ended increase decrease revenues cost of products sold gross margin operating and other expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before taxes income tax provision net income loss net income loss per share basic net income loss per share diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic weighted average shares outstanding diluted revenues 
total revenues for the twelve months ended december  amounted to  an increase of  or from the  reported for the twelve months ended december  non rechargeable product sales increased  or  from  in to  in the increase in revenues was mainly attributable to an increase in sales of batteries to international defense organizations  an increase in demand from automotive telematics customers  and a full year contribution from able which was acquired in mid  offset in part by lower volt battery revenues 
rechargeable product revenues decreased  or  from  in to  in the decrease in revenues was attributable to a strong prior year in which we shipped a large order of batteries and chargers for an ied jammer application 
sales of communications systems increased  or  from  in to  in this increase in revenues was mainly attributable to a growing demand for advanced communications systems and kits sold to government defense customers  including systems such as satcom on the move and other systems that provide a person with the ability to significantly extend the range of a communications radio 
in addition  since mcdowell was acquired in july  only a partial year s results were included in design and installation services revenues increased  or  from in to  in this increase in revenues was mainly attributable to the added contributions from the acquisitions of redblack in september and stationary power in november cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the increase in revenues 
consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue decreased from for the twelve months ended december  to for the year ended december  correspondingly  consolidated gross margins were for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december   generally attributable to higher sales and production volumes and a more favorable sales mix of higher margin products 
in the non rechargeable products segment  the cost of products sold increased  from  in the year ended december  to  in  mainly related to higher sales and production volumes 
non rechargeable gross margins for were  or  an increase of  from s gross margin of  or 
this increase in gross margin was mainly attributable to shipments of higher margin products to international customers 
in the rechargeable products segment  the cost of products sold decreased  from  in to  in rechargeable gross margins for were  or  a decrease of from s gross margin of  or 
this decrease in gross margin was the result of the decline in sales volumes and a modest change in sales mix 

table of contents in the communications systems segment  the cost of products sold increased  from  in to  in  reflective of the increase in revenues 
communications systems gross margins for were  or  a decrease from s gross margin of  or 
the decrease in gross margin percentages was mainly related to operational issues incurred at our waco  texas operation shortly after the acquisition of mcdowell in july that resulted in the procurement of premium cost inventory  increasing our cost of goods sold during as this inventory was sold to customers 
as a result of manufacturing inefficiencies at that facility  we relocated the waco operations to our newark  new york facility during the second half of  to instill better processes and manufacturing disciplines 
the actual costs associated with this relocation were relatively modest  amounting to approximately in addition  we encountered certain inefficiencies in our manufacturing process during the fourth quarter of as we ramped up our production operation to begin to fulfill certain large orders we received during the latter portion of for advanced communications systems  as we increased our workforce and trained new people on processes  procedures and systems 
design and installation services cost of sales increased  from for the year ended december   to  in design and installation services gross margins for were  or  an increase from s gross margin of  or 
this increase was mainly due to varying margins realized under different technology contracts  in addition to the contribution from redblack and stationary power 
operating and other expenses 
total operating expenses increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  overall  operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from reported the prior year 
research and development costs were  in  an increase of  or  over the  reported in this increase was mainly due to greater investments in the development of various new products  including products resulting from our acquisitions and support for a broader base of products 
in addition to the research and development line shown in operating expenses  we also consider our efforts associated with technology contracts for which we are paid revenues and related costs are included in the design and installation services segment  to be related to key product development efforts 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased  or  to  mainly related to costs associated with acquired companies and costs associated with providing a significantly higher level of support to enhance the growth prospects of these acquisitions  including increased personnel related costs  and higher professional fees incurred and corporate costs required to support a broader  more diverse business 
included in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses is  for in amortization expense associated with intangible assets related to our acquisitions  in selling  general and administrative expenses and  in research and development costs  an increase of  from the prior year amount of  driven by the timing of the acquisitions 
other income expense 
interest expense net increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this change was mainly related to higher interest on convertible debt and higher borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we recorded a gain on the mcdowell settlement of  as a result of a negotiated reduction in the purchase price that was finalized in november see note for additional information 
miscellaneous income expense amounted to income of for compared with income of for this income was primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains  and the increase related mainly to the strengthening of the uk pound sterling compared with the u 
s 
dollar 
income taxes 
we reflected a tax provision of for the twelve month period ended december  compared with  in the same period of at the end of  we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset  due to the determination that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize these benefits in the future 
at december   we continue to recognize a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset  as we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize these benefits in the future 
see notes and for additional information 
net income 
net income was  or per basic and diluted common share  for the year ended december  compared with a net loss of  or per basic and diluted common share  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of an improvement in the operating loss due to improved profit margins on revenues and overall increase in sales volumes  the recognition of a non operating gain on the mcdowell settlement  and the recognition of a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset in that did not reoccur in average common shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share increased from  in to  in  mainly due to stock option exercises  the dilutive impact from unexercised options and warrants  and the partial year impact of the limited public offering completed in november where an additional  shares were issued 

table of contents adjusted ebitda in evaluating our business  we consider and use adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  as a supplemental measure of our operating performance 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before net interest expense  provision benefit for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  plus minus expenses income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operations 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to review and assess our operating performance and to enhance comparability between periods 
we also believe the use of adjusted ebitda facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in such items as capital structures affecting relative interest expense and stock based compensation expense  the book amortization of intangible assets affecting relative amortization expense  the age and book value of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense and other significant non cash  non operating expenses or income 
we also present adjusted ebitda because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance 
we reconcile adjusted ebitda to net income loss  the most comparable financial measure under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
we use adjusted ebitda in our decision making processes relating to the operation of our business together with us gaap financial measures such as income loss from operations 
we believe that adjusted ebitda permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance  relative to our performance based on our us gaap results  while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization  which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance  and of non cash stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense that varies widely among companies 
we provide information relating to our adjusted ebitda so that securities analysts  investors and other interested parties have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations 
we believe that trends in our adjusted ebitda are a valuable indicator of our operating performance on a consolidated basis and of our ability to produce operating cash flows to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
the term adjusted ebitda is not defined under us gaap  and is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap 
our adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and when assessing our operating performance  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for net income loss or other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with us gaap 
some of these limitations include  but are not limited to  the following adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  does not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  and does not reflect all of the costs associated with operating our business  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  while stock based compensation is a component of cost of products sold and operating expenses  the impact on our consolidated financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as assumed life of the stock based awards and assumed volatility of our common stock  and other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
adjusted ebitda is calculated as follows for the periods presented 
table of contents years ended december  net income loss add interest expense  net add income tax provision add depreciation expense add amortization expense add stock based compensation expense less gain on mcdowell settlement less gain on debt conversion adjusted ebitda liquidity and capital resources cash flows and general business matters as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  during the twelve months ended december   we generated  of cash from operating activities as compared to generating  of cash for the twelve months ended december  the cash from operating activities generated during was mainly attributable to our pre tax income of  plus an addback of  for non cash expenses including depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation 
approximately  of cash was used for working capital due mainly to increases in accounts receivable and inventories  offset by an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in prepaid expenses 
for  the cash generated from operating activities of  was mainly attributable to a pre tax income of  plus an addback for non cash expenses of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation of  offset by a deduction of  for the non cash gain from the mcdowell settlement agreement 
approximately  of cash was used for working capital due mainly to an increase in inventories that resulted from sizeable orders for communications systems in the latter part of in  we used  of cash in investing activities   of which was used to purchase fixed assets  and  of which was used in connection with the acquisition of use  as well as a contingent purchase price payout related to the able acquisition 
during  we used  of cash in financing activities 
the financing activities included outflows of  for revolver loan repayments   for principal payments on our term loan  capital leases  and debt we assumed from acquisitions  and purchase of treasury shares of  the financing activities included inflows of  from stock option and warrant exercises 
although we booked a full reserve for our deferred tax asset during the fourth quarter of and continued to carry this reserve as of december  and  we continue to have significant us nol s available to us to utilize as an offset to taxable income 
as of december   none of our us nol s have expired 
during  we utilized  of our us nol carryforwards such that over the next five years  there are no scheduled expirations of our us nol s 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inventory turnover for the year ended december  averaged turns compared to turns for the improvement in this metric is mainly due to the increased volume of sales and production activity during  primarily driven by our communications systems business 
going forward  we anticipate achieving an annual rate of between and turns 
our days sales outstanding dsos was an average of days for  an improvement from the average of days  mainly due to more favorable timing on payments received from customers in our communications systems segment 
our order backlog at december  was approximately  the majority of the backlog was related to orders that are expected to ship throughout as of december   we had made commitments to purchase approximately of production machinery and equipment  which we expect to fund through operating cash flows 

table of contents potential commitments in october  we received a contract valued at approximately  from the us defense department to purchase equipment and enhance processes to reduce lead time and increase manufacturing efficiency to boost production surge capability of our ba battery during contingency operations 
under the contract  we had also purchased and pre positioned critical long lead time materials and subassemblies 
during  and  we received approximately  primarily related to reimbursement for raw material inventory and the procurement of certain equipment 
the funding under this contract was completed during we have had certain exigent non bid contracts with the us government that have been subject to an audit and final price adjustment  which have resulted in decreased margins compared with the original terms of the contracts 
as of december   there were no outstanding exigent contracts with the government 
as part of its due diligence  the government has conducted post audits of the completed exigent contracts to ensure that information used in supporting the pricing of exigent contracts did not differ materially from actual results 
in september  the defense contracting audit agency dcaa presented its findings related to the audits of three of the exigent contracts  suggesting a potential pricing adjustment of approximately  related to reductions in the cost of materials that occurred prior to the final negotiation of these contracts 
we have reviewed these audit reports  have submitted our response to these audits and believe  taken as a whole  the proposed audit adjustments can be offset with the consideration of other compensating cost increases that occurred prior to the final negotiation of the contracts 
while we believe that potential exposure exists relating to any final negotiation of these proposed adjustments  we cannot reasonably estimate what  if any  adjustment may result when finalized 
in addition  in june  we received a request from the office of inspector general of the department of defense dod ig seeking certain information and documents relating to our business with the department of defense 
we are cooperating with the dod ig inquiry and are furnishing the requested information and documents 
at this time we have no basis for assessing whether we might face any penalties or liabilities on account of the dod ig inquiry 
the aforementioned dcaa related adjustments could reduce margins and  along with the aforementioned dod ig inquiry  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
from august through august  we participated in a self insured trust to manage our workers compensation activity for our employees in new york state 
all members of this trust have  by design  joint and several liability during the time they participate in the trust 
in august  we left the self insured trust and have obtained alternative coverage for our workers compensation program through a third party insurer 
in the third quarter of  we confirmed that the trust was in an underfunded position ie the assets of the trust were insufficient to cover the actuarially projected liabilities associated with the members in the trust 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a liability and an associated expense of as an estimate of our potential future cost related to the trust s underfunded status based on our estimated level of participation 
on april   we  along with all other members of the trust  were served by the state of new york workers compensation board compensation board with a summons with notice that was filed in albany county supreme court  wherein the compensation board put all members of the trust on notice that it would be seeking approximately  in previously billed and unpaid assessments and further assessments estimated to be not less than  arising from the accumulated estimated under funding of the trust 
the summons with notice did not contain a complaint or a specified demand

in addition  our liability is limited to the extent that the trust was underfunded for the years of our participation 
as of december   we have determined that our reserve for this potential liability continues to be reasonable 
the final amount may be more or less  depending upon the ultimate settlement of claims that remain in the trust for the period of time we were a member

the settlement agreement reduced the overall purchase price by approximately  by reducing the principal amount on the convertible note from  to  and eliminating a  liability related to the purchase price adjustment formula

there have been several amendments to the credit facility during the past few years  including amendments to authorize acquisitions and modify financial covenants 
effective february   we entered into forbearance and amendment number six to the credit agreement forbearance and amendment with the banks 
the forbearance and amendment provided that the banks would forbear from exercising their rights under the credit facility arising from our failure to comply with certain financial covenants in the credit facility with respect to the fiscal quarter ended december  specifically  we were not in compliance with the terms of the credit facility because we failed to maintain the required debt to earnings and ebit to interest ratios provided for in the credit facility at that time 
the banks agreed to forbear from exercising their respective rights and remedies under the credit facility until march  forbearance period  unless we breached the forbearance and amendment or unless another event or condition occurred that constituted a default under the credit facility 
each bank agreed to continue to make revolving loans available to us during the forbearance period 
pursuant to the forbearance and amendment  the aggregate amount of the banks revolving loan commitment was reduced from  to  during the forbearance period  the applicable revolving interest rate and the applicable term interest rate  in each case as set forth in the credit agreement  both were increased by basis points 
in addition to a number of technical and conforming amendments  the forbearance and amendment revised the definition of change in control in the credit facility to provide that the acquisition of equity interests representing more than of the aggregate ordinary voting power represented by the issued and outstanding equity interests of us shall constitute a change in control for purposes of the credit facility 
previously  the equity interest threshold had been set at effective march   we entered into extension of forbearance and amendment number seven to credit agreement extension and amendment with the banks 
the extension and amendment provided that the banks agreed to extend the forbearance period until may  the extension and amendment also acknowledged that we continued not to be in compliance with the financial covenants identified above for the fiscal quarter ended december  and did not contemplate being in compliance for the fiscal quarter ending march  effective may   we entered into extension of forbearance and amendment number eight to credit agreement second extension and amendment with the banks

as of december   we were in compliance with all of the credit facility covenants  as amended 
as of december   we had  outstanding under the term loan component of our credit facility with our primary lending bank and was outstanding under the revolver component 
at december   the interest rate on the revolver component was 
as of december   the revolver arrangement provided for up to  of borrowing capacity  including outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we had no outstanding letters of credit related to this facility  as amended april   leaving  of additional borrowing capacity 
on january   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the restated credit agreement with jp morgan chase bank  na and manufacturers and traders trust company together  the 
table of contents lenders 
the restated credit agreement reflects the previous ten amendments to the original credit agreement dated june  between us and the lenders and modifies certain of those provisions 
the restated credit agreement among other things i increases the current revolver loan commitment from  to  ii extends the maturity date of the revolving credit component from january  to june   iii modifies the interest rate  and iv modifies certain covenants 
the rate of interest is based  in general  upon either a libor rate plus a eurodollar spread or an alternate base rate plus an abr spread  as that term is defined in the restated credit agreement  within a predetermined grid  which is dependent upon whether earnings before interest and taxes for the most recently completed fiscal quarter is greater than or less than zero 
generally  borrowings under the restated credit agreement will bear interest based primarily on the prime rate plus to basis points or libor plus to basis points 
additionally  among other covenant modifications  the restated credit agreement modifies the financial covenants by i revising the debt to earnings ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio and ii deleting the current assets to liabilities ratio 
previously our wholly owned uk subsidiary  ultralife batteries uk ltd 
ultralife uk  had a revolving credit facility with a commercial bank in the uk this credit facility provided our uk operation with additional financing flexibility for its working capital needs 
any borrowings against this credit facility were collateralized with that company s outstanding accounts receivable balances 
during the second quarter of  this credit facility was terminated 
the ultralife uk operations will be funded by operating cash flows and cash advances from ultralife corporation  if necessary 
while we believe relations with our lenders are good and we have received waivers as necessary in the past  there can be no assurance that such waivers can always be obtained 
in such case  we believe we have  in the aggregate  sufficient cash  cash generation capabilities from operations  working capital  and financing alternatives at our disposal  including but not limited to alternative borrowing arrangements eg asset secured borrowings and other available lenders  to fund operations in the normal course and repay the debt outstanding under our credit facility 
continuing volatility in the debt capital markets may affect our ability to access those markets 
notwithstanding these adverse market conditions  we believe that current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations  together with access to external sources of funds from the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 
equity transactions during  and  we issued approximately   and  shares of common stock  respectively  as a result of exercises of stock options and warrants 
we received approximately  in   in and  in in cash proceeds as a result of these transactions 
during  and  we issued restricted stock awards of   and  shares of our common stock  respectively  to certain officers and directors  with various vesting schedules related to time and performance 
at december    shares had vested 
during  and  we issued  and unrestricted shares of common stock  respectively  to directors 
in november  we completed a limited public offering  whereby  shares of our common stock were issued 
total net proceeds from the offering were approximately  of which  was used for the stationary power acquisition cash payment   was used as a prepayment on the subordinated convertible notes that were issued as partial consideration for the mcdowell acquisition  and  was used as a repayment of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility used to fund the redblack acquisition 
the remainder of the proceeds was used for general working capital purposes 
in connection with our may stock purchase of able  we issued a combination of shares and warrants exercisable for shares of our common stock to the previous owners of able as part of the purchase price 
the equity portion of the purchase price consisted of  shares of our common stock valued at  based on the closing price of the stock on the closing date of the acquisition  and  stock warrants with a five year term valued at  for a total equity consideration of  in january   warrants were exercised 
in connection with our july acquisition of substantially all of the assets of mcdowell  we issued to mcdowell a non transferable  subordinated convertible promissory note in the principal amount of  as part of the purchase price 
the  convertible note carried a five year term  an annual interest rate of and was convertible at per share into million shares of our common stock  with a forced conversion feature  at our option  at any time after the 
table of contents day average closing price of our common stock exceeded per share 
the conversion price was subject to adjustment as defined in the subordinated convertible promissory note 
interest was payable quarterly in arrears  with all unpaid accrued interest and outstanding principal due in full on july  in april  in connection with its dissolution  mcdowell distributed the convertible note to its previous owners in proportion to their ownership interests  resulting in six separate convertible notes aggregating to  on november   we finalized a settlement agreement with the sellers of mcdowell  which resolved various operational issues that arose during the first several months following the acquisition that significantly reduced our profit margins 
the settlement agreement reduced the overall purchase price by approximately  by reducing the principal amount on the convertible notes from  to  and eliminating the  liability related to the purchase price adjustment 
in addition  the interest rate on the convertible notes was increased from to and we made prepayments totaling  on the convertible notes 
in january  the convertible notes were converted in full into  shares of our common stock 
in connection with our november acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of stationary power  we issued  to the previous owner of stationary power  a subordinated convertible promissory note in the principal amount of  as part of the purchase price 
the  convertible note carries a three year term  an annual interest rate of and is convertible at per share into  shares of our common stock  with a forced conversion feature at per share 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment as defined in the subordinated convertible promissory note 
interest is payable quarterly in arrears  with all unpaid accrued interest and outstanding principal due in full on november  in addition  on the achievement of certain post acquisition sales milestones  we will issue up to an aggregate amount of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with our november acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of rps  we issued  shares of our common stock valued at  in connection with our november acquisition of certain assets of use  on the achievement of certain post acquisition financial milestones  we will issue up to an aggregate amount of  unregistered shares of our common stock 
we utilized securities as consideration in these transactions in part to reduce the need to draw on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents and revolving credit facility 
in october  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to  to be implemented over the course of a six month period 
repurchases may be made from time to time at management s discretion  either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchases will be made in compliance with securities and exchange commission guidelines and will be subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  and other factors 
we have no obligation under the program to repurchase shares and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
we intend to fund the purchase price for shares acquired primarily with current cash on hand and cash generated from operations  in addition to borrowing from our credit facility  if necessary 
as of december   approximately  remained of the  approved repurchase amount 
other matters we continue to be optimistic about our future prospects and growth potential 
we continually explore various sources of liquidity to ensure financing flexibility  including leasing alternatives  issuing new or refinancing existing debt  and raising equity through private or public offerings 
although we stay abreast of such financing alternatives  we believe we have the ability during the next months to finance our operations primarily through internally generated funds or through the use of additional financing that currently is available to us 
in the event that we are unable to finance our operations with the internally generated funds or through the use of additional financing that currently is available to us  we may need to seek additional credit or access capital markets for additional funds 
we can provide no assurance  given the current state of credit markets  that we would be successful in this regard 
if we are unable to achieve our plans or unforeseen events occur  we may need to implement alternative plans 
while we believe we can complete our original plans or alternative plans  if necessary  there can be no assurance that such alternatives would be available on acceptable terms and conditions or that we would be successful in our implementation of such plans 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings of this report  we are involved in certain environmental matters with respect to our facility in newark  new york 
although we have reserved for expenses related to this potential 
table of contents exposure  there can be no assurance that such reserve will be adequate 
the ultimate resolution of this matter may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which it is resolved 
with respect to our battery products  we typically offer warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase 
with respect to our communications accessory products  we typically offer a four year warranty 
we also offer a year warranty on our volt batteries that are used in ionization type smoke detector applications 
we provide for a reserve for these potential warranty expenses  which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that our reserves would be sufficient 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

outlook based on current visibility  management expects revenue for the full year of to be at least  with operating income of approximately  based on our outlook for order opportunities and strong demand for the our products and services 
management expects strong revenue growth in its rechargeable products segment  in addition to year over year increases in the non rechargeable products and design and installation services segments 
management expects another strong year in for communications systems  though it expects less revenue as the large orders for advanced communications systems that were shipped in are not expected to reoccur at the same level 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates and assumptions that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below 
revenue recognition product sales in general  revenues from the sale of products are recognized when products are shipped 
when products are shipped with terms that require transfer of title upon delivery at a customer s location  revenues are recognized on date of delivery 
a provision is made at the time the revenue is recognized for warranty costs expected to be incurred 
customers  including distributors  do not have a general right of return on products shipped 

table of contents service contracts revenue from the sale of installation services is recognized upon customer acceptance  generally the date of installation 
revenue from fixed price engineering contracts is recognized on a proportional method  measured by the percentage of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
revenue from time and material engineering contracts is recognized as work progresses through monthly billings of time and materials as they are applied to the work pursuant to the terms in the respective contract 
revenue from customer maintenance agreements is recognized using the straight line method over the term of the related agreements  which range from six months to three years 
technology contracts we recognize revenue using the proportional method  measured by the percentage of actual costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the contract 
elements of cost include direct material  labor and overhead 
if a loss on a contract is estimated  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
we allocate costs to all technology contracts based upon actual costs incurred including an allocation of certain research and development costs incurred 
deferred revenue for each source of revenues  we defer recognition if i evidence of an agreement does not exist  ii delivery or service has not occurred  iii the selling price is not fixed or determinable  or iv collectability is not reasonably assured 
valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
our inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
we record provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory based on changes in customer demand  technology developments or other economic factors 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are our purchasing practices  material and product obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials see item a risk factors for further information on foreign regulations 
we manage our exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
warranties we maintain provisions related to normal warranty claims by customers 
we evaluate these reserves quarterly based on actual experience with warranty claims to date and our assessment of additional claims in the future 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that our reserves would be sufficient 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly assess all of our long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
this is accomplished by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets with the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment 
should aggregate future cash flows be less than the carrying value  a write down would be required  measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated either through the assistance of an independent valuation or as the present value of expected discounted future cash flows 
the discount rate used by us in our evaluation approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment  no impairment is recognized 
environmental issues environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  the purchase price paid to effect an acquisition is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at fair value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead measure these assets for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that impairment exists 
we amortize intangible assets that have definite lives so that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized over their weighted average estimated useful life 

table of contents stock based compensation we follow the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
we calculate expected volatility for stock options by taking an average of historical volatility over the past five years and a computation of implied volatility 
a blended volatility factor was deemed to be more appropriate as we believe that implied volatility  a forward looking measure  provides a more market driven valuation related to investors expectations of the volatility of our business  and provides a balance against focusing only on a historical measure 
the computation of expected term was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards and vesting schedules 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
income taxes we apply sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that may be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
in december  we placed a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets arising from our conclusion that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize our us nol s that had accumulated over time 
the recognition of the full valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset resulted from our evaluation of all available evidence  both positive and negative  including recent historical net income losses  income losses on a cumulative three year basis  and as well as other objective evidence 
as of december   we continued to recognize a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  based on a consistent evaluation methodology that was used for and arising from our conclusion that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize our us nol s that have accumulated over time 
as of december   we continue to recognize a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to the extent they are not able to be offset by future reversing temporary differences 
the assessment of the realizability of the of the us nol was based on a number of factors including  our history of net operating losses  the volatility of the company s earnings  our historical operating volatility and our historical ability to accurately forecast earnings for future periods as well the increased uncertainty of the general business climate as of the end of we concluded that these factors represent sufficient negative evidence and have concluded that we should record a full valuation allowance under sfas no 
achieving business plan targets  particularly those relating to revenue and profitability  is integral to our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands we are exposed to various market risks in the normal course of business  primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
our primary interest rate risk is derived from our outstanding variable rate debt obligation 
in july  we hedged this risk by entering into an interest rate swap arrangement in connection with the term loan component of our credit facility 
under the swap arrangement  effective august   we received a fixed rate of interest in exchange for a variable rate 
the swap rate received was for five years and is adjusted accordingly for a eurodollar spread incorporated in the agreement 
as of december   a one basis point change in the eurodollar spread would have a less than value change 
we are subject to foreign currency risk  due to fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar 
in the year ended december   approximately of our sales were denominated in us dollars 
the remainder of our sales was denominated in us pounds sterling  euros  australian dollars  canadian dollars  indian rupee and chinese yuan renminbi 
a change in the value of the pound sterling  the euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  the rupee or the yuan renminbi to the us dollar would have impacted our revenues in that period by less than 
we monitor the relationship between the us dollar and other currencies on a continuous basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in these foreign currencies as appropriate to safeguard against the fluctuations in the currency effects relative to the us dollar 
we maintain manufacturing operations in north america  europe and asia  and export products internationally 
we purchase materials and sell our products in foreign currencies  and therefore currency fluctuations may impact our pricing of products sold and materials purchased 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries maintain their books in local currency  which is translated into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements 
a change in local currency relative to the us dollar would have impacted our consolidated income before taxes by approximately  or approximately
