overview we completed a reverse merger transaction on april  with lighten up enterprises international  inc  or lighten up  a nevada corporation initially formed on january  the directors and management of bionovo biopharmaceuticals thereupon became the directors and management of lighten up 
bionovo biopharmaceuticals financial statements are the historical financial statements of the post merger entity  bionovo  inc bionovo biopharmaceuticals  inc 
was incorporated and began operations in the state of california in february and subsequently reincorporated into the state of delaware in march until june   the name of bionovo biopharmaceuticals was bionovo  inc on june   we changed our corporate name from lighten up enterprises international  inc to bionovo  inc 
and changed our state of incorporation from nevada to delaware 
bionovo biopharmaceuticals is in the process of dissolution as a wholly owned subsidiary of bionovo  inc the historical information in this annual report is that of bionovo biopharmaceuticals as if bionovo biopharmaceuticals had been the registrant for all the periods presented in this annual report 
the historical information in the management s discussion and analysis or plan of operation and the audited consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report include those of bionovo biopharmaceuticals prior to the reverse merger  as these provide the most relevant information for us on a continuing basis 
business we are a clinical stage drug discovery and development company focusing on women s health and cancer  two large markets with significant unmet needs 
building on our understanding of the biology of menopause and cancer  we design new drugs derived from botanical sources which have novel mechanisms of action 
based on the results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies to date  we believe that we have discovered new classes of drug candidates with the potential to be leaders in their markets 
our lead drug candidate  menerba tm  represents a new class of receptor sub type selective estrogen receptor modulator serm for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms of menopause  or hot flashes 
we have designed menerba tm to selectively modulate estrogen receptor beta er and to provide a safe and effective alternative to existing fda approved therapies that pose a significant risk to the patient for developing breast cancer and other serious diseases 
in preclinical studies  menerba tm inhibited tumor growth as well as bone resorption known to cause osteoporosis  which is commonly developed during menopause 
this activity  if confirmed in clinical testing  would differentiate menerba tm from some existing therapies and other therapies in clinical development 
in our completed  randomized  placebo controlled phase ii trial involving patients for which we announced results in  the higher of two menerba tm doses tested was well tolerated and resulted in a statistically significant reduction of hot flashes as well as a statistically significant reduction in night awakenings  when compared to placebo at weeks of treatment  which represents superior efficacy to existing non hormonal therapies 
we plan to seek fda approval to conduct further clinical testing at multiple clinical sites in the us we believe that menerba tm s novel mechanism of action could lead to a more favorable safety profile than currently approved hormone therapies ht and other therapies under development and testing 
we are also developing bzl  an oral anti cancer agent for advanced breast cancer 
unlike most other anti cancer drugs and drug candidates  which try to control cancer through genomic and proteomic signaling pathways  bzl is designed to take advantage of the unique metabolism of cancer cells 
bzl inhibits glycolysis  a metabolic pathway on which cancer cells rely 
glycolysis inhibition leads to dna damage and death of cancer cells without lasting harm to normal cells 
we believe that bzl may have a preferential effect on hormone independent cancers  a subset with few treatment options 
to date  women with metastatic breast cancer have been treated with bzl in two separate phase clinical trials 
as predicted by the mechanism of action  bzl had very limited toxicities with an extremely favorable tolerability profile 
moreover  bzl showed encouraging clinical activity among a cohort of women with metastatic breast cancer who had been heavily pretreated with other regimens 
a phase trial has been approved by the fda and the irbs at several prestigious breast cancer clinical sites in the us bionovo is awaiting funding to commence this open label  non randomized trial in women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer who have failed no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens 
we plan to evaluate bzl for the treatment of other forms of cancer  including pancreatic cancer and adjuvant use in breast cancer 

table of contents we have a diverse pipeline of additional preclinical drug candidates in both women s health and cancer 
we submitted an investigational new drug  or ind  application and plan to initiate a phase i trial in the second half of for our second serm drug candidate  vg  for the treatment of post menopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy  or vaginal dryness 
we have identified or begun preclinical work on other drug candidates for a variety of indications within women s health and cancer 
we have internally discovered and developed all of our drug candidates using our proprietary biological and chemical techniques 
our drug development process targets herbs and other botanical sources  used in traditional chinese medicine  believed to produce biologically active compounds 
we apply our clinical knowledge  experience with natural compounds and knowledge of proper scientific screening tools to isolate and purify botanical compounds and extracts for pharmaceutical development 
in june  the fda released a document to provide drug developers with guidance on the approval for botanical drugs 
this guidance states that applicants may submit reduced documentation of nonclinical preclinical safety to support an ind application for initial clinical studies of botanicals 
the first botanical extract drug developed pursuant to these guidelines was approved by the fda in october to date  all of our drug candidates are derived from botanical extracts and are being developed in accordance with this fda guidance 
in addition  we have identified the active chemical components underpinning the mechanism of action for our novel drugs  and in some cases  we have developed synthetic methods of production 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future  and do not expect to generate profits until and unless our drug candidates have been approved and are being marketed with commercial partners 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
historically we have funded our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of our capital stock  equipment lease financings  license fees and interest earned on investments 
on october   the company received million  net of underwriting discount  from the closing of its public offering of million shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share and  warrants at a price of per warrant  exercisable at per share of common stock 
development stage company we have not generated any significant revenue since inception 
the accompanying financial statements have  therefore  been prepared using the accounting formats prescribed by sfas no 
for a development stage enterprise dse 
although the company has recognized some nominal amount of revenue  the company still believes it is devoting  substantially  all its efforts on developing the business and  therefore  still qualifies as a dse 
the company is primarily engaged in the development of pharmaceuticals  derived from botanical sources  to treat cancer and women s health 
the initial focus of the company s research and development efforts will be the generation of products for the treatment of breast and other cancers  and to alleviate the symptoms of menopause 
the production and marketing of the company s products and its ongoing research and development activities are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states 
prior to marketing in the united states  any drug developed by the company must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the food and drug administration fda under the food  drug and cosmetic act 
the company has limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical and clinical testing necessary to obtain regulatory approval 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter problems in clinical trials that will cause the company or the fda to delay or suspend clinical trials 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain patents and product license rights  maintain trade secrets  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others  both in the united states and other countries 
there can be no assurance that patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantage resulting in the company s transition from development stage enterprise reporting 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to clinical trial accruals  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  restructuring costs and stock based compensation 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies related to revenue recognition  clinical trial accruals  stock based compensation  income tax and research and development expenses to be the most critical accounting policies  because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenues are derived from collaborative research and development arrangements  technology licenses  and government grants 
revenue is recognized when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met i a contractual agreement exists  ii transfer of technology has been completed or services have been rendered  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  nonrefundable upfront license fees are recognized over the license term using the straight line method of accounting when the technology is transferred or accessed  provided that the technology transferred or accessed is not dependent on the outcome of our continuing research and development efforts 
accruals as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and make adjustments  if necessary 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation stock based compensation to outside consultants is recorded at fair market value in general and administrative expense 
effective january  we record expenses relating to stock options granted to employees based on the fair value at the time of grant 
the fair value of stock options and warrants is calculated using the black scholes pricing method on the date of grant 
this option valuation model requires input of highly subjective assumptions 
because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in our management s opinion  the existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of fair value of our employee stock options 
in order to determine the fair value of our stock for periods prior to the date of our reverse merger transaction  we estimated the fair value per share by reviewing values of other development stage biopharmaceutical organizations  comparing products in development  status of clinical trials  and capital received from government and private organizations 
once a total value was determined  we then factored the number of shares outstanding  or possibly outstanding  resulting in an estimated value per share 
once we completed our reverse merger transaction on april   the trading price of our common stock was used 
for periods prior to our reverse merger transaction  we chose not to obtain contemporaneous valuations of our stock by any unrelated valuation specialist after realizing the cost of services would be substantial and that the benefit derived would not be substantially different from our estimate as we had used a multi tiered approach to estimate the value of our stock 

table of contents income tax effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standard board  financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas the interpretation applies to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas and requires a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return 
subsequent recognition  derecognition and measurement is based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and the california state jurisdiction 
to date  we have not been audited by the internal revenue service or any state income tax jurisdiction 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense 
to date  there have been no interest or penalties charged to us in relation to the underpayment of income taxes 
we generated net losses since inception through the year ended december  and accordingly did not record a provision for federal income taxes 
the provision for income taxes on the statements of operations does include a provision for the california state minimum franchise tax on businesses 
as of december   our total deferred tax assets were million 
the deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards 
due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to continue to generate future taxable income to realize these tax assets  a full valuation allowance has been established to offset our deferred tax assets 
additionally  the future utilization of our nol carry forwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future 
we have not yet determined whether such an ownership change has occurred 
if necessary  the deferred tax assets will be reduced by any carryforwards that expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations  with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
research and development activities in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or fas  no 
 accounting for research and development costs  research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  pre clinical and clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials  and facilities costs our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
during the year ended december   we incurred research and development expenses of million  and we incurred research and development expenses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we further expect that research and development expenses will increase when and as we continue to advance in the development of our drugs 
most of our product development programs are at an early stage 
accordingly  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products 
completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to predict 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at a reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect our product development efforts 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost or whether we will obtain any approval required by the fda on a timely basis  if at all 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenues years ended december  increase decrease to to revenues licensing nih grant total revenues revenues consist primarily of licensing fees and proceeds from a us government grant

interest income was  in compared to  in and  in the decrease in of  from reflects a lower average cash balance 
net interest income increased by  in compared to due to a higher average balance as a result of our successful private placement completed in january and a public offering completed in october interest expense includes interest expense from leases for laboratory equipment 
the  increase in interest expense for compared to represents additional capital lease agreements required to purchase additional laboratory equipment 
the  increase in interest expense in compared to was due primarily to capital lease agreements 
other expense consists of charges related to the leasing of computer equipment  fees for a letter of credit securing our lease of lab equipment and other lease financing charges 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have incurred losses  and we have relied primarily on leasing  public and private financing to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash  equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million at december  and million at december the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in of million is due primarily to net cash used in operating activities of million for clinical trial related expenses of our lead drug candidates  and costs associated with the new facilities build out

as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  working capital of million and shareholders equity of million 
management believes that cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   will be sufficient to enable us to meet our obligations through however  if we change our development plans  we may need additional funds sooner than we expect 
in addition  we anticipate that our costs for the menerba tm and bzl programs will increase over the next few years 
while these costs are unknown at the current time  we will need to raise additional capital to continue the program in future periods through and beyond we intend to seek any required additional funding through government grants  collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available during  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
furthermore  if we are not able to secure funds in a timely fashion during  we may not be able to continue as a going concern

recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for specified financial assets and liabilities on a contract by contract basis 
the company did not elect to adopt the fair value option under this statement 
effective january   the company adopted eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities 
eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results or operations or financial condition 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  the company has adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable as level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents in december  eitf no  accounting for collaborative arrangements was issued 
eitf provides guidance concerning determining whether an arrangement constitutes a collaborative arrangement  how costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties should be reported in the income statement  how an entity should characterize payments on the income statement  and what participants should disclose in the notes to the financial statements about a collaborative arrangement 
eitf is effective as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after december  and shall be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
the company is in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  of adopting eitf on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which replaces sfas no 
the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
sfas no 
r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
we are currently evaluating the effects  if any  that sfas r may have on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas no 
 which amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset under fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fsp requires an entity to consider its own assumptions about renewal or extension of the term of the arrangement  consistent with its expected use of the asset  and is an attempt to improve consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fas no 
 business combinations 
the fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
the fsp is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
in may  the fasb issued financial accounting standard fas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles 
unlike statement on auditing standards sas no 
 the meaning of present in conformity with gaap  fas no 
is directed to the entity rather than the auditor 
the statement is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board pcaob amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with gaap  and is not expected to have any impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movement 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices intended to protect against these and other exposures 
as a result  we do not anticipate material potential losses in these areas 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and highly liquid short term investments 
our short term investments will likely decline by an immaterial amount if market interest rates increase and  therefore  we believe our exposure to interest rate changes is immaterial 
declines of interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income from short term investments
