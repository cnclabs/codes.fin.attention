overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the aesthetic and therapeutic skin health markets 
we develop and commercialize prescription based  topical skin health systems that enable physicians to treat a range of skin conditions  including pre mature aging  photo damage  skin laxity  hyperpigmentation  acne and soft tissue deficits  such as fine lines and wrinkles 
current products 
our primary product line is the obagi nu derm system  which we believe is the only clinically proven  prescription based  topical skin health system on the market that has been shown to enhance the skin s overall health by correcting photo damage at the cellular level  resulting in a reduction of the visible signs of aging 
the primary active ingredients in this system are hydroquinone and over the counter  or otc  skin care agents 
in april  we introduced the obagi c rx system consisting of a combination of prescription and otc drugs and adjunctive cosmetic skin care products to treat skin conditions resulting from sun damage and the oxidative damage of free radicals 
the central ingredients in this system are hydroquinone and vitamin c 
in october  we launched the obagi professional c products  a complete line of proprietary  non prescription products  which consists of vitamin c serums used to reduce the appearance of damage to the skin caused by ultraviolet radiation and other environmental influences 
in july  we launched our obagi condition enhance system  for use in conjunction with commonly performed cosmetic procedures including botox injections 
in october  we launched our first product in the elastiderm product line  an eye cream for improving the elasticity and skin tone around the eyes 
we introduced the clenziderm md system and a second product in the elastiderm product line to address acne and skin elasticity around the eye  respectively  based on positive interim clinical results  in february in july  we launched our second system in the clenziderm md line  clenziderm md system ii  which is specifically formulated for normal to dry skin 
in august  we launched two new nu derm condition enhance systems 
one is designed specifically for use with non surgical procedures while the other has been developed for use with surgical procedures 
in february  we launched elastiderm d colletage  a system to treat skin conditions resulting from sun damage and improve the elasticity and skin tone for the neck and chest area 
we also market tretinoin  used for the topical treatment of acne in the us  and obagi blue peel products  used to aid the physician in the application of skin peeling actives 
in august  we entered the pharmacy rx channel with our first product  soluclenz tm  a solubilized benzoyl peroxide gel for the treatment of acne  which is available only by prescription 
in january  we launched obagi rosaclear  a system to treat the symptoms of rosacea 
future products 
we focus our research and new product development activities on improving the efficacy of established prescription and otc therapeutic agents by enhancing the penetration of these agents across the skin barrier using our proprietary technologies collectively known as penetrating therapeutics 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce any additional systems using these technologies 
us distribution 
we market all of our products through our direct sales force in the united states primarily to plastic surgeons  dermatologists and other physicians who are focused on aesthetic skin care 
aesthetic skin care 
as of december   we sold our products to more than  physician dispensing accounts in the united states  with no single customer accounting for more than of our net sales 
our current products  other than soluclenz  are not eligible for reimbursement 
we generated us net sales of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
retail pharmacy rx channel 
we market soluclenz through our dermatology sales force and an outside third party contract sales organization in the us primarily to dermatologists 
we sell soluclenz to pharmaceutical wholesalers who then distribute directly to the pharmacy to fill patient prescriptions 
international distribution 
we market our products internationally through international distribution and two licensing partners that have sales and marketing activities in countries outside of the united states 
much like our business model in the united states  these distributors sell our products through direct sales representatives to physicians  or through alternative distribution channels depending on regulatory requirements and industry practices 
we generated international net sales of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
licensing 
we market our products in the japanese retail markets through a trademark and know how license agreement with rohto 
under our agreement  rohto is licensed to manufacture and sell a series of otc products under the obagi brand name in the japanese drug store channel  and we receive a royalty based upon sales of obagi branded products in japan by rohto 
rohto s obagi branded products are sold through approximately  high end drug stores 
we have other licensing arrangements in japan to market and sell otc product systems under the obagi brand  both for in office use in facial procedures  as well as for sale as a take home product kit in the spa channel 
we receive royalties based upon these arrangements 
we generated licensing revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales growth 
our total net sales have grown from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our sales growth has been driven primarily by new elastiderm sales coupled with the launch of the third product in the product line in january our sales growth has been driven primarily by our professional marketing efforts to physicians 
our professional sales force targets physicians who are providing aesthetic treatments and educates them on how to best provide our products to their patients 
our professional sales force also provides education to physicians  aestheticians  other staff and patients about the benefits of promoting skin health 
we have increased our sales force from employees as of january  to employees as of december   which includes a person contracted sales force hired to support the launch of soluclenz 
we will continue to invest in expanding our sales force as warranted by the success of new product offerings and continued core product growth 
we currently do not have plans to hire a substantial number of employees in strong growth in the aesthetic skin care market 
additionally  the independent research firm  kalorama information  estimates that from to  over million people in the united states will receive cosmetic facial procedures for which they will pay over billion 
we believe this reflects a growing desire and acceptance among the aging population to seek aesthetic facial products and procedures from their physicians 
with our leading position in the physician dispensed channel  the clinically proven aesthetic benefits of our products and the potential of our systems to enhance or complement many other facial procedures  we believe we are well positioned to meet this growing patient demand 
conducting clinical studies on our products 
we have completed clinical studies since to demonstrate the efficacy of our products 
we believe that these clinical studies provide our products added scientific credibility in the physician dispensed market 
we plan to initiate approximately additional clinical studies by december international 
we have formal distribution agreements with distribution and two licensing partners covering over countries and a trademark and product know how license agreement in the otc market of japan 
currently  those distributors have sales activities in approximately countries  with growth in and coming primarily from the middle east  far east  europe  and americas 
results of operations 
we commenced operations in  and as of december   we had accumulated earnings of million 
we reported net income of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
seasonality 
sales of our products have historically been higher between september and march 
we believe this is due to increased product use and patient compliance during these months 
we believe this increased usage and compliance relates to several factors such as higher patient tendencies toward daily compliance inversely proportionate to their tendency to travel and or engage in other disruptive activities during summer months 
patient travel and other disruptive activities that affect compliance are at their peak during july and august 
the effects of seasonality in the past have been offset by the launch of new products 
this trend was very pronounced during when we launched four new product offerings and rebranded two systems 
economy 
many treatments in which our products are used are considered cosmetic in nature  are typically paid for by the patient out of disposable income and are generally not subject to reimbursement by third party payors such as health insurance organizations 
as a result  we believe that our current and future sales growth may to some extent be influenced by the economic conditions within the geographic markets in which we sell our products 
during the year ended december   we saw the unprecedented economic conditions within the us have a negative impact on our revenue growth performance 
we believe that the economic downturn has reduced disposable income  which we believe has led to reduced patient visits to physician offices for aesthetic procedures and patients using less product per application to extend the time needed for obtaining refills of product from their physicians 
the us economic slow down effect was seen in all of our product categories  as growth was slower than expected  but was more pronounced within the nu derm product line 
at this time  it is extremely difficult to measure the severity  length  geographic and financial impact of the economic downturn and its longer term impact on our product sales  but we will continue to monitor it closely 
we do believe that some of the negative impact may be partially offset due to the following i the continued growth in our market share  ii the aesthetic nature of our products  iii the lower price point of our products compared to other aesthetic products in our market  iv the desire to maintain a healthy and youthful appearance  and v the demographics of the patients who use our products 
launch of soluclenz 
we launched soluclenz in august since the launch  we have been monitoring the weekly scripts filled by pharmacies 
currently  one of the three major reimbursement compendiums does not permit reimbursement of soluclenz and our sales have suffered as a result 
to the extent that certain patients continue to be unable to obtain reimbursement for soluclenz based on the availability of a generic equivalent  future sales will continue to be impacted  and we may discontinue selling soluclenz into the pharmacy rx channel 
however  while we are disappointed with the results  in the fourth quarter of  we continued to take steps to make soluclenz a commercially viable product 
we are currently exploring alternatives to marketing this novel product such as potential partnering in both or either the pharmacy rx channel and the otc channel 
as such  we believe that the inventory on hand and consigned inventory of million and million  respectively  as of december  related to our soluclenz product is recoverable 
in the event we aren t successful in establishing a partnership in either the pharmacy rx or otc channels  we may incur approximately million to million in expenses related to the write down of inventory and early termination of contracts 
future growth 
we believe that our future growth will be driven by increased direct sales coverage  penetration into non core markets such as other medical specialties  ongoing marketing efforts to create increased awareness of the obagi brand and the benefits of skin health and new product offerings 
we plan to continue to invest resources on the commercialization of new applications of our current products  the continuing development of our pipeline of products and the in licensing or acquisition of new product opportunities 
however  due to the uncertainties in the economic markets  our current business plan does not anticipate that we invest significant resources in these strategic initiatives 
we believe that our on going profitability is primarily dependent upon the continued success of our current product offerings 
since we are unable to ascertain the length and severity of this downturn  we could be in a position to decide to invest in such initiatives in a relatively short time frame once the global markets begin to stabilize 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  sales and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales return reserve  accounts receivable  inventory and goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
by their nature  these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results 
our significant accounting policies are further described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues for our physician dispensed segment in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii shipment of products has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 
our shipment terms are fob shipping point as outlined in our sales agreements 
our domestic sales agreements do not provide for rights of return or price protection 
however  we may approve returns on a case by case basis at our discretion 
certain international distribution agreements do provide for rights of return and price protection 
generally  such return rights are for a period of not more than days after the products have been shipped to the distributors 
in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we continuously monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future amount of such future returns  based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns 
we do not grant any warranty provisions on our products 
we provide for discounts and allowances based on historical experience at the time revenue is recognized as a reduction to revenue 
to date such provisions have approximated management s estimates 
other than our provision for future returns  the only estimates that we have to make regarding revenue recognition pertain to the collectability of the resulting receivable  both of which are discussed below 
we grant price protection rights to certain international distributors 
such price protection rights require us to pay the distributor if there is a reduction in the list price of our products 
price protection payments would be required for the distributor s inventory on hand or in transit on the date of the price reduction  for a period not to exceed days prior to the date of the price reduction 
we have not recorded a liability in connection with such price protection rights as we have never reduced the list prices of our products 
in september  we entered into a licensing agreement  as amended in november  with rohto see note to our financial statements  a large japan based company that specializes in the distribution and marketing of otc medical oriented products in the drug store and retail channels 
in january  we entered into a licensing agreement with tokyo beauty center see note  a diversified japanese consumer products and services company  which also owns and operates a large chain of aesthetic spas in japan 
royalty revenue is recognized as earned and is based upon a predetermined rate within the respective licensing agreement 
as noted earlier  during the year ended december   we entered the pharmacy rx channel for the first time by launching soluclenz rx geltm  a solubilized benzoyl peroxide gel for the treatment of acne  which is available only by prescription 
we sell soluclenz to pharmaceutical wholesalers  who have the right to return purchased product prior to the units being dispensed through patient prescriptions 
revenue for this product is recognized in accordance with sab no 
and sfas no 
among its criteria for revenue recognition from sale transactions where a buyer has a right of return  sfas no 
requires the amount of future returns to be reasonably estimated 
during the launch period only  we sold product to wholesalers with a guaranteed sale provision  allowing the wholesalers to return the product within days of shipment 
product shipments during the launch period were  for the year ended december  as substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership did not transfer upon shipment  we are treating the sale of product during the launch period and after the launch period under a consignment model 
under this consignment model  we did not recognize revenue upon the shipment of product with the guaranteed sale provision and accounted for inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory 
due to our limited experience in the pharmacy rx channel  we are currently unable to reasonably estimate customer returns and  therefore  will only recognize revenue related to soluclenz units once the units have been dispensed through patient prescriptions because units dispensed to patients are not subject to return 
we obtain actual prescription units dispensed based on distribution channel data provided by external  independent sources 
as of december   amounts included as deferred revenue in accrued liabilities totaled gross product revenue and net product revenue gross product revenue  net of cash discounts  rebates and patient coupons for prescription units dispensed was and  respectively  for the year ended december  inventory on consignment represents the cost of soluclenz units shipped to wholesalers that has not yet been dispensed to patients 
we will continue to recognize revenue upon prescription units dispensed until we can reasonably estimate product returns based on our product returns experience 
at that time  we will record a one time increase in net revenue related to the recognition of revenue previously deferred 
in order to develop a methodology  and provide a basis  for estimating future product returns on sales to our wholesalers at the time of shipment  we have begun tracking the soluclenz product return history  taking into consideration product expiration dating at time of shipment and inventory levels in the distribution channel 
revenue will also be reduced for estimates of allowances for cash discounts  rebates and patient coupons based on historical experience  and current contract prices and terms with wholesalers 
if actual  or expected wholesaler returns and revenue allowances differ from previous estimates  adjustments of these estimates would be recognized in the period such facts become known 
sales returns and allowances 
when we sell our products  we reduce the amount of revenue recognized from such sales by an estimate of future product returns and other sales allowances 
sales allowances include cash discounts  rebates and sales incentives relating to products sold in the current period 
factors that are considered in our estimates regarding sales returns include the historical rate of returns as a percent of gross sales less licensing fees  historical aging of returns and the current market conditions 
we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period after shipment of the product has occurred 
factors that are considered in our estimates regarding sales allowances include quality of product and recent promotional activity 
if actual future experience for product returns and other sales allowances exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flow would be negatively impacted 
to date  such provisions have approximated management s estimates 
accounts receivable 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical write offs as a percentage of sales less licensing fees  adjusted specifically for accounts that are past due  non performing  in bankruptcy or otherwise identified as at risk for potential credit loss 
receivables are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is deemed to be uncollectible  taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer and the value of any collateral 
recoveries of receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments and this exceeds our estimates as of the balance sheet date  we would need to charge additional receivables to our allowances  and our financial position  results of operation and cash flow would be negatively impacted 
our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established 
inventory 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market  computed at actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory reserves are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value 
inventory reserves are charged to cost of sales and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology  new product offerings and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins 
to date  actual reserve requirements approximated management s estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires  among other things  the use of a nonamortization approach for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a nonamortization approach  goodwill and intangibles having an indefinite life are not amortized  but instead will be reviewed for impairment at least annually or if an event occurs or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
events or circumstances which could indicate an impairment include a significant change in the business climate  economic and industry trends  legal factors  negative operating performance indicators  significant competition  changes in our strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to such reporting units  assignment of goodwill to such reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we have selected september as the date on which we will perform our annual goodwill impairment test 
we attribute the entire balance of our goodwill of million to our largest operating segment  which is also a reporting unit  the physician dispensed segment 
our determination of fair value of our goodwill considered the current and future economic  market  and competitive conditions  and other relevant factors 
we evaluated the fair value of our goodwill using two approaches 
for the first method  we derived valuation multiples from historical earnings data of guideline companies within our industry that compete in the physician dispensed market  and then evaluated and adjusted the multiples based on our strengths and weaknesses relative to the guideline companies 
the derived multiples are then applied to our operating data to arrive at an indication of fair value 
cash free invested capital multiples  representing a marketable  minority interest  were calculated for the guideline companies as of september  revenue and earnings multiples were based on a valuation of the guideline companies profit margins  historical growth patterns  and a review of our own market factors  primarily related to our physician dispensed business 
the second method  the discounted cash flow method  focused on the expected cash flows of our physician dispensed business 
we evaluated earnings projections through  trending the growth down to in the terminal year 
the discount rate for our physician dispensed segment was determined by utilizing a weighted average cost of capital analysis  which analyzed long term government bonds  the moody s seasoned aaa bond rate  the cost of equity of similar companies relative to our physician dispensed business  as well as our capital structure 
both methods were weighted 
the analyses concluded that the fair value of our physician dispensed segment significantly exceeded the carrying amount of our goodwill 
there were no impairment triggers subsequent to september  as such  based on our analyses  no impairment charges were recognized for the years ended december    and other intangible assets consist of trademarks  distribution rights  covenants not to compete  patents  customer lists  and proprietary formulations 
other intangible assets are amortized over the expected period of benefit using the straight line method over the following lives trademarks years  distribution rights ten years  covenants not to compete seven years  and other intangible assets three to years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets including intangible assets that are amortized are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  such as a significant sustained change in the business climate  during the interim periods 
if an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is compared to the asset group s carrying value 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
there were no indicators of impairment noted during  therefore no tests were performed for long lived assets 
any unfavorable changes in market conditions or our product lines may result in the impairment of goodwill or an intangible asset  which could adversely impact our net income 
leases 
we account for leases under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and subsequent amendments  which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as either operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
minimum base rents for our operating leases  which generally have scheduled rent increases over the term of the lease  are recorded on a straight line basis over the lease term 
the initial lease term includes the period from when we are given access and control over the lease property  whether or not rent payments are due under the terms of the lease 
for leases with renewal periods at our option  we generally consider the lease term to consist of the initial lease term  as exercise of the renewal options as determined at lease inception are not considered to be reasonably assured of exercise 
however  if failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty of sufficient magnitude to us  then the renewal  at inception  is reasonably assured and will be included in the determination of the appropriate lease term 
in certain instances  we disburse cash for leasehold improvements  furnishings  fixtures and equipment to renovate leased premises 
if costs are paid directly by the landlord or reimbursed to us by the landlord  we record a deferred rent liability and amortize the deferred rent liability over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense 
in other instances  we may expend cash for landlord additions that we make to leased premises that are reimbursed to us by the landlord 
based on the specifics of the leased space and the lease agreement  during the renovation period  amounts paid will be recorded as prepaid rent and any landlord reimbursement will be recorded as an offset to prepaid rent 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment 
in connection with our january adoption of sfas no 
r  we adopted the modified prospective transition method in the first quarter of fiscal  and as a result  did not retroactively adjust results from prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation is recognized for i expense related to the remaining unvested portion of all stock option awards granted during the one year period preceding our initial public offering  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and ii expense related to all stock option awards granted on or subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with sab no 
 share based payment  sab no 
 the remaining unvested options we issued prior to the one year period preceding our initial public offering  with the exception of the october grants  are not included in the sfas no 
r option pool as they were valued using the minimum value method 
as a result  unless subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled  such unvested options will not be included in stock based compensation 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the date of grant using any valuation model requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
we estimated our options expected terms in accordance with sab no 
and sab no 
 using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding 
if we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term was more reasonable than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for stock based awards could change significantly 
higher volatility and expected terms result in a proportional increase to stock based compensation determined at the date of grant 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
the impact of sfas no 
r on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  on income before income taxes and net income was million and million and had a and a impact on basic and dilutive earnings per share  respectively 
for the year ended december   the impact on income before income taxes and net income was million and million  respectively  and had a and a impact on basic and diluted earnings per share  respectively 
in addition  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we presented the tax benefit resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash inflows in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  the excess tax benefits for those options are classified as financing cash inflows 
prior to our common stock being actively traded  our board of directors  the members of which we believe have extensive business  finance and investment experience  were required to estimate the fair value of our common stock at the time of each option grant for purposes of determining stock based compensation expense for the periods presented herein 
in response to that requirement  our board of directors appointed members of the compensation committee to analyze our stock value and recommend common stock valuation estimates 
for economic reasons  we initially chose to value our options using a model that employed a market based approach based principally upon applying appropriate valuation multiples to the ebitda and revenue and not to obtain a contemporaneous valuation by an independent third party 
as a privately held company  we believed that the members of our compensation committee had the requisite experience and expertise to determine the fair value of the options 
if a valuation model using different input variables and assumptions had been used  our common stock valuation may have been different 
if we had made different assumptions and estimates  the amount of our recognized and to be recognized stock based compensation expense  net income and net income per share amounts could have been materially different 
we believe that we have used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants practice guide  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  to determine the fair market value of our common stock 
uncertainty in income taxes 
effective january   we began to measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with fin fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

the expanded disclosure requirements of fin are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements in part i  item i 
fin prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
only tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of this interpretation 
fin also provides guidance on accounting for derecognition  interest and penalties  and classification and disclosure of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes 
prior to january   we recorded accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it was probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of the contingency could be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized approximately a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as an increase to the january  accumulated deficit balance 
as of december   the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million 
results of operations the year ended december  compared the year ended december  net sales 
the following table compares net sales by product line and certain selected products for the year ended december  and year ended december  change in thousands net sales by product category physician dispensed nu derm   vitamin c   elasticity   therapeutic   other   total   pharmacy rx licensing fees   total net sales   united states international net sales increased by million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  overall  the economic conditions within the us had a slightly negative impact on our revenue growth performance during the year ended december  we believe that the economic downturn has reduced disposable income which we believe has led to reduced patient visits to physician offices for aesthetic products and procedures  and fewer such procedures being performed and products being purchased 
the us economic slow down effect was seen in all of our product categories  as growth was lower than expected  but was more pronounced within the nu derm product line 
during the year ended december   we experienced nu derm sales decline of million 
we saw sales growth of million and million in the vitamin c and other categories  respectively 
the growth in the vitamin c category was primarily due to strong sales performance by the professional c product line 
the other product category growth was driven by a sales focused system approach 
the system approach is designed to educate physicians on the benefits of prescribing the complete nu derm system as opposed to partial systems 
we had a total of million increase in elasticity sales driven by the launch of our elastiderm d colletage product in january  our new system that focuses on restoring the elasticity of the neck and chest area 
we had a total of million increase in therapeutic sales due to the sales performance of clenziderm  the primary product in our therapeutic product category  which was launched in february  with a second system launched in july pharmacy rx  our new operating segment  includes the sale of prescription and over the counter dermatological products that are dispensed through pharmacies 
the primary product sold in this channel  soluclenz rx gel  which was launched in august  generated million during the year ended december  licensing fees increased million during the year ended december  our aggregate sales growth was comprised of million in the us and million from international markets 
the us growth was fueled by the recent launch of two new product lines 
international sales growth came from all product lines and primarily came from two regions  million from the europe and other region  and million from the americas  offset by a decrease of million in the far east and million in the middle east 
our licensing fees increased million primarily due to fees received under our agreement with rohto 
we believe  depending upon its duration and severity  that a continued us economic slow down may negatively impact our future net sales 
gross margin percentage 
our gross margin percentage decreased to  for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the overall decline is primarily attributable to a decline in gross margin for our physician dispensed segment  which decreased to compared to for the same period last year 
the decline is primarily as a result of i a million increase in discounting promotional activities  and ii a million increase in inventory reserves related to short dated product in our therapeutic and other product categories 
the decline in our physician dispensed segment was offset by the gross margin for our licensing segment  which increased to compared to for the same period last year 
cost of sales also consists of outbound shipping and handling  work order scrap  licensing and royalty fees related to licensed intellectual property  depreciation and amortization attributable to products sold  and an inventory reserve for shrinkage and write downs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization not attributable to products sold  warehousing costs  advertising  travel expense and other selling expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the following i a million increase due to an increase in headcount  largely direct sales  marketing and operational personnel  ii a million increase in costs related to the preparation  launch and on going marketing activities related to soluclenz  which was launched in august  iii a million increase in volume driven activities  iv a million increase in marketing costs  primarily related to the launch of our national consumer awareness campaign during launched in the third quarter of  v a million increase in expenses related to severance and compensation expense for stephen a 
garcia  our former chief financial officer  and other former employees  vi a million increase in rent and related expenses due to the relocation of our corporate headquarters during the second half of  vii a million increase in non cash compensation primarily due to restricted stock units and stock options granted during the year ended  viii a million increase in technical support fees due to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system  ix a million increase in other expenses  offset by i a million decrease in expenses related to operating as a public company  primarily consisting of professional fees  and ii a million decrease in depreciation and amortization 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  were as compared to in the year ended december  we expect to minimize additional operating costs  such as professional fees and insurance costs  due to the downturn in the economy 
we intend to maintain or decrease selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the following i a million decrease in salaries and related benefits during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to a decrease in headcount  and ii a million decrease in royalties paid to dr 
obagi pursuant to the june  services agreement 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs in the year ended december  were as compared to in the year ended december  interest income and interest expense 
interest expense was million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we made million in prepayments  million of which came from the net proceeds received in our secondary public offering completed in october  in addition to our regularly scheduled payments of million and an excess cash payment of million 
the additional prepayments resulted in a complete paydown of our outstanding debt 
interest expense incurred during the year ended december  partly relates to amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately million related to our line of credit obtained in conjunction with the credit agreement 
in connection with entering a new line of credit agreement with comerica see further discussion in the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the previous credit agreement  dated as of january  as amended was terminated 
termination of the agreement resulted in a write off of debt issuance costs of approximately million during the year ended december  and was charged to interest expense 
interest income increased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in our average cash and short term investments balance to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  income taxes 
income tax expense decreased million to million for year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in state taxes  a decrease in nondeductible expenses for tax purposes  and the increase in the tax benefit  as a percentage of net income  derived from the research and development credit during the year ended december  the year ended december  compared the year ended december  net sales 
the following table compares net sales by product line and certain selected products for the year ended december  and year ended december  change in thousands net sales by product category physician dispensed nu derm   vitamin c   elasticity   therapeutic  other   total   licensing   total net sales   united states international net sales increased by million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we experienced nu derm sales growth of million 
in addition  we saw sales growth of million and million in the vitamin c and other categories  respectively 
the two product categories formally launched in  elasticity and therapeutic  increased million and million  respectively 
licensing fees increased million during the year ended december  our sales growth was comprised of million of growth in the united states and million in growth from international markets 
us growth was fueled by the overall growth in the skin care market  the recent launch of two new product lines and the expansion of our sales force 
over of the product category sales growth experienced was attributable to unit volume growth 
the nu derm product category growth was largely driven by the expansion of our sales force  the promotional and educational efforts of our professional sales force and the launch of nu derm condition enhance for botox in july and the launch of two condition enhance systems in august  which on a combined basis contributed million 
the growth in the vitamin c category was primarily driven by the strong sales performance by the obagi c rx product line 
the elasticity product category growth was due to a full year of sales of our elastiderm eye cream product during the year ended december  as compared to only months during the year ended december  and the february launch of the second product in the category  elastiderm eye gel 
the therapeutic product category growth is attributable to the official launch of our clenziderm product line in february and the launch of the second clenziderm system in july the other product category growth was driven by the continued success of our system approach concept launched in early the system approach is designed to educate physicians on the benefits of prescribing the complete nu derm system as opposed to partial systems 
international sales growth was primarily in the elasticity  vitamin c and therapeutic product lines and primarily came from four regions  million from the europe and other region  million from north america excluding the united states  million from the middle east  and million from the far east 
our licensing fees increased million primarily due to fees received under our agreement with rohto 
gross margin percentage 
our gross margin percentage decreased to  for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   primarily as a result of i the million increase in therapeutic sales  which solely consist of our clenziderm product line that has a lower gross margin compared to our other product line offerings  ii start up manufacturing costs for the bpo serum gel burden on the initial units produced and sold  and iii a decline in our vitamin c margin due to a reserve for obsolete inventories arising from product reformulation of approximately million 
this was partially offset by improved margins on products in our other product line due to new contract volume purchasing discounts with the manufacturer 
although we anticipate gaining efficiency in our manufacturing processes for clenziderm  we believe our margins will remain slightly lower in the near future as we ramp up the sales volume of our clenziderm product line 
cost of sales also consists of outbound shipping and handling  work order scrap  licensing and royalty fees related to licensed intellectual property  depreciation and amortization attributable to products sold  and an inventory reserve for shrinkage and write downs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization not attributable to products sold  warehousing costs  advertising  travel expense and other selling expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the following i a million increase due to the hiring of additional employees  largely direct sales and administrative support personnel  during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   ii a million increase in expenses for physician training  practice building and patient acquisition  iii million increase primarily consisting of market research targeting physicians and patients and for product development  iv a million increase in non cash compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas no

as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  were as compared to in the year ended december  we expect to incur additional operating costs  such as professional fees and insurance costs  related to the growth of our business 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a one time payment of million to dr 
zein obagi  or dr 
obagi  one of our principal stockholders and one of our former officers and directors  under a noncompete agreement during the year ended december  there were no such payments made in as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs in the year ended december  were as compared to in the year ended december  interest income and interest expense 
interest expense was million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decline is primarily attributable to the prepayment of million in debt with the net cash proceeds received in our initial public offering completed in december during the year ended december  we made million in prepayments  million of which came from the net proceeds received in our secondary public offering completed in october  in addition to our regularly scheduled payments of million and an excess cash payment of million 
the additional prepayments resulted in a complete paydown of our outstanding debt 
interest income increased  to  during the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in our average cash balance to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  income taxes 
income tax expense increased million to million for year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the decrease in the tax benefit  as a percentage of net income  derived from the research and development credit and certain costs incurred during the secondary offering completed in october not being deductible for tax purposes during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our cash generated by operations and availability under our revolving credit agreement the facility entered into in november as of december  we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million available under the facility 
we currently believe that our existing cash balances and cash generated by operations  together with our available credit capacity  will enable us to meet foreseeable liquidity requirements 
the following has or is expected to impact liquidity we expect to continue to invest in our enterprise resource planning erp system  on august   the board of directors gave us the authority to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common shares in the open market over the next two years 
during the year ended december   we purchased million of our outstanding stock  and our days sales outstanding dso has increased from days at december  to at december  in response  we have increased our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  we are operating in an uncertain and volatile economic environment  which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business 
the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by recent volatility in the financial markets  including declines in stock prices  and by uncertain economic conditions 
increases in food and fuel prices  changes in the credit and housing markets leading to the current financial and credit crisis  actual and potential job losses among many sectors of the economy  significant declines in the stock market resulting in large losses to consumer retirement and investment accounts  and uncertainty regarding future federal tax and economic policies have all added to declines in consumer confidence and curtailed consumer spending 
we expect the weak economic environment to continue and do not expect macroeconomic conditions to be conducive to growth in achieving financial results that compare favorably with year ago results will be challenging in the first half of in the first quarter of  we expect a sales decline that is more or less consistent with the fourth quarter trend 
we intend to moderate our growth plans and avoid credit and market risk 
we expect to continue to generate positive working capital through our operations and  at this time  we do not anticipate drawing on our facility 
as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the facility 
however  as of december   we were not in compliance with the non financial covenant  requiring us to report monthly  a listing of our intellectual property 
subsequent to year end  we obtained a waiver for the months of november  december and january with respect to this covenant 
we expect to be in compliance with both our non financial and financial covenants during the remainder of  however economic conditions or the occurrence of events discussed above under risk factors could cause noncompliance within our financial covenants 
we expect to be able to manage our working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in working capital 
we have invested approximately million in capital expenditures during the year ended december   which largely consist of expenses related to our new corporate headquarters and erp system 
in  we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily related to the completion of our erp system  sales force automation and it upgrades 
we do expect to slow down our investing activities in response to the current economic conditions 
we intend to maintain our strong balance sheet 
cash requirements for our business historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements and through private and public sales of common stock 
we currently invest our cash and cash equivalents in large money market funds and certificates of deposit with maturities no greater than one year 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  respectively 
pursuant to the third amendment of our credit agreement entered into in november with ge business financial services  inc formerly known as merrill lynch business financial services  inc  during the year ended december   we made a mandatory million excess cash payment  million in principal payments and million in optional principal repayments on the outstanding balance of the terms loans 
approximately million of the net proceeds generated from our secondary public offering on october  was utilized to pay down our outstanding balance of our term loans and our revolving line of credit under the credit agreement 
as of december   we had completely paid down the outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement were subject to certain financial and operating covenants that included  among other provisions  maintaining a maximum debt to ebitda ratio and minimum ebitda levels and restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 
under the terms of the credit agreement  if stonington ceased to own at least of our outstanding common stock  it would be considered an event of default 
certain covenants also limited annual capital expenditures and use of proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities 
we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants as of december  on november   we entered into the facility with comerica bank for million 
the facility has an initial term of three years  ending on november   unless terminated earlier in accordance with its provisions 
any borrowings on the facility bear variable interest based on a margin  at our option  over prime rate or libor as defined in the facility 
all amounts borrowed under the facility are secured by a first priority security interest in all of our tangible and intangible assets 
the facility contains certain financial and non financial covenants 
non financial covenants include  among other things  certain limitations on annual capital expenditures and asset or equity based investments and monthly and quarterly reporting of a listing of our intellectual property 
financial covenants include requirements for maintaining a i minimum quick ratio  ii maximum ratio of total liabilities to net worth  iii no loss for two consecutive quarters  iv minimum level of profitability  v maximum annual capital expenditures  vi stock repurchases not to exceed million  vii maximum dividend distribution not to exceed of net income for the fiscal year  and viii joint venture investment not to exceed million 
see below for covenant compliance facility covenants as of requirement minimum quick ratio maximum ratio of total liabilities to effective tangible net worth quarterly results no net loss for any quarter ended in no net loss for two consecutive quarters minimum annual profitability million million maximum annual capital expenditures million million maximum stock repurchase million million maximum dividend distribution million joint venture investment million as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the facility 
as noted earlier  as of december   we were not in compliance with the non financial covenant requiring us to report monthly a listing of our intellectual property 
subsequent to year end  we obtained a waiver with respect to this covenant 
we believe that we will be in compliance with all financial and non financial debt covenants during the remainder of in connection with establishing the facility  the previous credit agreement  dated as of january  as amended was terminated 
we were not in default under this credit agreement  nor did it have any outstanding balance on the credit agreement with ge business financial services  inc at the time of termination 
termination of the agreement resulted in a write off of debt issuance costs of approximately million during the year ended december  on august   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common shares over a period of two years 
the purchases are to be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements 
the timing manner  price and amount of any repurchases are determined by a three person committee  consisting of members of our board and management  at its discretion and will be subject to economic and market conditions  stock price  applicable legal requirements and other factors that may be discontinued at any time 
during the year ended december   we purchased  shares of our outstanding stock for a cost of million 
we continually evaluate new opportunities for therapeutic systems or products and  if and when appropriate  intend to pursue such opportunities through the acquisitions of companies  products or technologies and our own development activities 
our ability to execute on such opportunities in some circumstances may be dependent  in part  upon our ability to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
on november   our board of directors approved an amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws in preparation for our initial public offering 
this amended and restated certificate of incorporation was approved by the stockholders on november  and was filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware in december the changes included i increasing our total authorized shares to   common and  preferred  ii modifying the classes  term and number of the members of the board of directors  and iii implementing other changes deemed necessary for a public reporting company 
we also revised our compensation committee and nominating committee charters and adopted new policies to follow current best practices for public companies 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services that we use 
the competitive environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our net sales in were derived from operations outside the united states and were denominated in japanese yen 
none of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies

is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with us gaap for nongovernmental entities 
sfas no

fas fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp fas allows an entity to use its own historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements  adjusted for specified entity specific factors  in developing assumptions about renewal or extension used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
additional disclosures are required to enable financial statement users to assess the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the entity s intent and or ability to renew or extend the arrangement 
the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset is to be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
the disclosure requirements are to be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
we do not believe the adoption of fsp fas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

eitf  accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf provides guidance on whether non refundable advance payments for goods that will be used or services that will be performed in future research and development activities should be accounted for as research and development costs or deferred and capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been rendered 
we adopted the provisions of this issue beginning january  the adoption of eitf did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  to permit all entities to choose to elect  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value 
an entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date  and recognize upfront costs and fees related to those items in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
sfas no 
became effective for us as of january  we did not elect the fair value option for any financial assets or liabilities 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this new standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
in this standard  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data for example  the reporting entity s own data 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however  fsp no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 was issued in february which defers the effective date of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
accordingly  our adoption of this standard as of january  was limited to financial assets and liabilities 
the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
relating to financial assets and liabilities did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt the provisions related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of the provisions related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in large money market funds and certificates of deposit with maturity dates no greater than one year 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
although substantially all of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the us we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us prime rate and libor interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us libor interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
if the interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest income would increase or decrease by approximately million 
other risks generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses as deemed appropriate based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
although our dso has increased from days at december  to at december   and we continue to see a weakened economic environment  we do not believe that our accounts receivable balance represents a credit risk based upon our past collection experience 
the current economic downturn has had an adverse impact on the financial services industry  including insurance companies  some of whom we currently are insured by 
to the extent we have any claims in the future and such insurance providers are unable  due to their financial condition  to pay covered claims  we could experience adverse impacts on our cash flow and cash reserves 
we have no way of knowing whether or not any new insurance providers that are financially stable at this time will experience financial difficulties in the future that could impact their ability to pay covered claims
