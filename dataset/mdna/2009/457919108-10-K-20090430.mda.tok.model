item selected financial data not required for smaller reporting companies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the ownership and operation of hotel properties 
at january   the innsuites system included five moderate and full service hotels with hotel suites 
four of our hotels are branded through franchise agreements with best western 
all five hotels are trademarked as innsuites hotels 
we are also involved in various operations incidental to the operation of hotels  such as the operation of restaurants and meeting banquet room rentals 
our operations consist of one reportable segment  hotel ownership  which derives its revenue from the operation of the hotels 
in addition  we receive management fees  trademark license fees and reservation fees from four hotels owned by mr 
wirth and his affiliates and trademark license fees from one hotel owned by a non related third party 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing  which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
improved economic conditions  both generally and specifically in the travel industry  had a positive impact on our operations in fiscal year and in most of fiscal year we anticipate the negative trend in the travel industry  which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  to continue through fiscal year declining overall economic conditions are expected to result in decreased business and leisure travel and lower room rates  and therefore lower operating margins 
we expect the major challenge for fiscal year to be strong competition for group business in the markets in which we operate  which may affect our ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
we believe that we have positioned the hotels to remain competitive through selective refurbishment and carrying a relatively large number of two room suites at each location 
while the downturn in the economy did not significantly affect the hospitality industry during fiscal year  we believe that we will be prepared for such an event by continuing to maintain tight costs controls and high labor efficiency throughout fiscal year hotel properties held for sale we reclassified all of our hotel properties from held for sale to held and used in the third quarter ended october  due to the economic conditions and credit market restraints  the funds were not available to potential buyers to finance a purchase of one or more of our hotels 
as a result of this reclassification  we recorded million in depreciation expense that was previously suspended while the assets were held for sale 
we continue to seek qualified buyers for our hotels and will continue to migrate our primary business from a hotel owner to a hospitality service company providing trademark licensing and management services 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical and involve the most subjective judgments include our estimates and assumptions of future revenue and expenditures used to project hotel cash flows 
future cash flows are used in the valuation calculation of our hotel properties to determine the recoverability or impairment of the carrying amounts in the event management is required to test the asset for recoverability of its carrying value under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated future cash flows over its estimated remaining life  the trust recognizes an impairment expense to reduce the asset s carrying value to its fair value 
fair value is determined by either the most current third party property appraisal  if available or the present value of future undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset 
our evaluation of future cash flows is based on our historical experience and other factors  including certain economic conditions and committed future bookings 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below 
at january  and  we owned a and  respectively  interest in four of the hotels through our sole general partner s interest in the partnership and owned a interest in one hotel 
we purchased  and  partnership units during the years ended january  and  respectively 
our expenses consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees  depreciation of the hotels and hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist primarily of payroll  guest and maintenance supplies  marketing and utilities expenses 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse us for all such expenses 
accordingly  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  which is calculated as rooms sold divided by total rooms available  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room revpar  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the hotels 
occupancy decreased to from in the prior year 
adr increased by to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  which resulted in a decrease in revpar of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data will continue or that occupancy  adr and revpar will not increase or decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions 
we enter into transactions with certain related parties from time to time

results of operations of the trust for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  overview a summary of operating results for the fiscal years ended january  and is change change revenue operating income net income loss income loss per share basic income loss per share diluted our overall results in were positively affected by the results from increased rate management efforts and were offset by the recording of million of depreciation on assets reclassified from held for sale to held and used  as discussed below 
for the twelve months ended january   we had total revenue of million compared to million for the twelve months ended january   a decrease of approximately million 
this decrease in total revenue is primarily due to lower occupancies at the hotels  resulting in decreased room revenues 
during  we expect lower occupancy and revenue levels compared to prior years 
total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  reflects an increase of approximately  compared to total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  the increase was primarily due to recording deferred depreciation on assets previously classified as held for sale of million in the third quarter of fiscal year general and administrative expenses include overhead charges for management  accounting  shareholder and legal services 
general and administrative expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  was consistent with the prior year total of million 
total operating expenses for the twelve months ended january  were million  an increase of approximately million  or  from million in the twelve months ended january  the increase was primarily due to recording deferred depreciation on assets held for sale of million in the third quarter of fiscal year total interest expense for the twelve months ended january  was million compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of  or  due to lower interest rates on variable rate debt and maintaining lower balances of debt 
interest on mortgage notes payable for the twelve months ended january  was million  a decrease of  or  from million in the twelve months ended january  the decrease is primarily due to reduced mortgage balances and a reduced rate on the tucson st 
mary s variable rate note 
interest on notes payable to banks decreased  or over  to  from  during the years ended january  and  respectively 
the decrease is due to less borrowings on our lines of credit 
hotel property depreciation for the twelve months ended january  was million  an increase of approximately million from million in the twelve months ended january  the increase was due to the recording of million of deferred depreciation on assets previously classified as held for sale when they were reclassified to held and used in the third quarter of fiscal we had a net loss before minority interest and income taxes of million for the twelve months ended january   compared to net income of million in the prior year 
after deducting the loss allocated to the minority interest of  and taxes of  we had a net loss attributable to shares of beneficial interest of approximately  for fiscal year this represented a decrease of approximately million in net income loss attributable to shares of beneficial interest comparing the twelve months ended january  and basic and diluted net loss per share was and  respectively  for the twelve months ended january   compared to a basic and diluted net income per share of and  respectively  for fiscal year the change since the prior year is attributable to reclassifying assets as held for sale to held and used and recording million of depreciation in the third quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources overview our principal source of cash to meet our cash requirements  including distributions to its shareholders  is our share of the partnership s cash flow and its direct ownership of the yuma  arizona property 
the partnership s principal source of revenue is hotel operations for the four hotel properties it owns 
our liquidity  including our ability to make distributions to our shareholders  will depend upon our ability and the partnership s ability to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations 
hotel operations are significantly affected by occupancy  which decreased from fiscal year to  and room rates at the hotels  which improved over the prior fiscal year  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing  which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
we anticipate a continuation of the slowing of the overall economic conditions that occurred late in fiscal  which could result in increased competition for business and leisure travel and that may not support the higher room rates of fiscal  and therefore could lower operating margins 
challenges in fiscal year are expected to include continued competition for group business in the markets in which we operate and our ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to the aggressive reduction of our payables and an increase in prepaid expenses during the year 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million and  for the years ended january   and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was due to increased spending on capital improvements 
net cash provided in financing activities totaled  for the year ended january  and net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended january  the increases year to year were primarily due to mortgage refinance of the yuma hotel property 
as of january   we had no commitments for capital expenditures beyond a reserve for refurbishment and replacements that is set aside annually  as described below 
we continue to contribute to a capital expenditures fund the fund an amount equal to of the innsuites hotels revenues from operation of the hotels 
the fund is restricted by the mortgage lender for four of our properties 
as of january    was held in these accounts and is reported on our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash 
the fund is intended to be used for capital improvements to the hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
during the twelve months ended january  and  the hotels spent approximately million and  respectively  for capital expenditures 
we consider the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing 
therefore  these amounts are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation was suspended on the hotel s capitalized assets between august  until august  while the hotels were classified as held for sale 
we plan to spend approximately  for capital expenditures in fiscal year the hotels also spent approximately million during both fiscal years and on repairs and maintenance and these amounts have been charged to expense as incurred 
we have minimum debt payments of  and million due during fiscal years and  respectively 
on march   we established an  revolving line of credit to replace the  line of credit that matured on may  the new  line of credit has no financial covenants  bears interest at wall street journal prime as of january  and matures on july  as of january   we had not drawn any funds available under the line of credit 
we plan to renew our bank line of credit when it matures during fiscal year we had projected that we may not be able to satisfy our remaining obligations during fiscal year by using only revenue generated by the hotels operations 
based on that projection  we refinanced our yuma hotel property for million and used the proceeds to pay down accounts payable  debt  prepaying worker s compensation premiums and holding approximately million in reserve 
as of january   we had mortgage notes payable of million outstanding with respect to the hotels   in secured promissory notes outstanding to unrelated third parties arising from the share of beneficial interest and partnership unit repurchases  and no principal due and payable under notes and advances payable to mr 
wirth and his affiliates 
management believes that cash on hand and future cash receipts from operations in fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the trust s obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
we may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as we consider prudent 
future positioning the board of trustees in viewing the hotel industry cycles determined that may have been the high point of the current hotel industry cycle and further determined it was appropriate to classify the five hotels owned by the trust as held for sale 
we began actively seeking buyers for our properties 
we engaged the services of several hotel brokers and began independently advertising our hotels for sale 
on august   the trust reclassified its hotel properties from held for sale to held and used 
after one year of efforts  we failed to find any qualified buyers for our hotel properties 
as a result of this reclassification  we recorded million in depreciation expense that was previously suspended during the period in which the assets were classified as held for sale 
we continue to independently advertise our hotels for sale 
our long term strategic plan is to obtain full benefit of our real estate equity and to migrate our focus from a hotel owner to a hospitality service company by expanding our trademark license  management  reservation  and advertising services 
this plan is similar to strategies followed by international diversified hotel industry leaders  which over the last several years have reduced real estate holdings and concentrated on hospitality services 
we began our long term corporate strategy when we relinquished our reit status in january  which had previously prevented us from providing management services to hotels 
in june  we acquired our trademark license and management agreements and began providing management  trademark and reservations services to our hotels 
in july  the board of trustees voted to list and or present for sale all five of our hotel properties 
the table below lists the hotel properties  their respective carrying and mortgage value and the estimated sales value for the hotel properties 
hotel property asset values as of january  hotel property book value mortgage balance listed sales price albuquerque ontario tucson oracle tucson city center yuma totals there is no assurance that the listed sales price for the individual hotel properties will be realized  however our management believes that these sales prices are reasonable based on local market conditions and comparable sales 
changes in market conditions have in part and may in the future result in our changing one or all of the sales prices 
we provide trademark licensing  management  reservation and advertising services to all the hotel properties listed above and expect to continue the trademark licensing services  which includes the reservation and advertising services  and or continue the management services  which also includes the reservation and advertising services  after the hotels are sold 
if any or all of these hotel properties are sold  our future management and or licensing fees could be reduced if the purchaser did not continue to retain innsuites hotels to provide those services 
in the past  when we have sold hotel properties to unrelated third parties  we have continued to provide management and or trademark licensing services after a sale  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so in the future 
as part of the board study for  greater emphasis has been placed on priority for additional management  trademark and reservations fee income 
we have determined that it is easier to sell management contracts when the trademark services are also provided 
therefore  the primary emphasis is on trademark and reservation services 
as part of the emphasis on trademark services  we have developed two trademark packages 
the first is the traditional innsuites hotels suites regional package and the second is the innsuites boutique collection  which now includes four affiliate hotels managed by us 
sales and marketing are being handled internally 
share repurchase program on january   the board of trustees approved a share repurchase program under rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  for the purchase of up to  limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
on september   august  and september   the board of trustees approved the purchase of up to  additional limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
additionally  on january   the board of trustees approved the purchase of up to  additional limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
acquired shares of beneficial interest will be held in treasury and will be available for future acquisitions and financings and or for awards granted under the innsuites hospitality trust stock incentive and option plan 
during fiscal year  we acquired  shares of beneficial interest in open market transactions at an average price of per share and  shares of beneficial interest in privately negotiated transactions at an average price of per share 
also  we acquired  rrf limited partnership units at an average price of per unit 
we intend to continue repurchasing shares of beneficial interest and rrf limited partnership units in compliance with applicable legal and nyse amex requirements 
off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business and employment contracts for key employees  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting matters below for a discussion of new accounting interpretations with respect to variable interest entities and the impact of such interpretations on us 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the policies we follow for the valuation of our hotel properties  which constitute the majority of our assets  are our most critical policies 
we apply sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine when it is necessary to test an asset for recoverability 
on an events and circumstances basis  we review the carrying value of our hotel properties both held for use and held for sale 
we will record an impairment loss and reduce the carrying value of a property when anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and the current market value of the property do not support its carrying value 
in cases where we do not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for use  we will reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the hotel  as determined by a current appraisal or other acceptable valuation methods 
in cases where we do not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for sale  we will reduce the carrying value to the sales price less costs to sell 
we did not recognize impairment loss in fiscal years or as of january   our management does not believe that the carrying values of any of its hotel properties are impaired 
accounting matters in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which became effective for years beginning on january  fin addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
we are subject to us federal income taxes as well as numerous state tax jurisdictions 
we adopted fin on february  our assessments of our tax positions in accordance with fin did not result in changes that had a material impact on results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
it is our policy to recognize any interest and penalties related to income taxes as tax expense 
the tax years through remain open to examination by the federal and state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted sfas no 
on february  and such adoption did not have a material impact on financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
was effective for financial assets and liabilities at february  and did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  which permits entities to present certain taxes assessed by a governmental authority on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or a net basis excluded from revenues 
an entity is not required to reevaluate its existing policies related to taxes assessed by a governmental authority but may choose to do so 
eitf issue no 
is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we report our revenue net of sales taxes and our management plans to continue to report revenue net of sales tax 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  business combinations sfas r and statement no 
 accounting and reporting of non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
these statements will significantly change the financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions and non controlling or minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas r requires companies to i recognize  with certain exceptions  of the fair values of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and non controlling interests in acquisitions of less than a controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity  ii measure acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination at fair value on the acquisition date  iii recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values  with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in earnings  iv with certain exceptions  recognize pre acquisition loss and gain contingencies at their acquisition date fair values  v capitalize in process research and development ipr d assets acquired  vi expense  as incurred  acquisition related transaction costs  vii capitalize acquisition related restructuring costs only if the criteria in sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  are met as of the acquisition date  and viii recognize changes that result from a business combination transaction in an acquirer s existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals as adjustments to income tax expense 
sfas r is required to be adopted concurrently with sfas and is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption of these statements is prohibited 
our management is presently evaluating the effect of adopting these statements 
inflation we rely entirely on the performance of the hotels and innsuites hotels ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general and innsuites hotels in particular can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit innsuites hotels ability to raise rates faster than inflation
