item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during fiscal  total revenue decreased compared to fiscal foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations unfavorably impacted revenue by in fiscal  compared to fiscal the lower total revenue for fiscal reflected lower services revenue of  and lower product revenue of  compared to fiscal the lower services revenue is due in part to our strategic initiative of focusing our services business on driving more profitable product revenue while leveraging our services capabilities internally and through third party partners 
the lower product revenue for fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily a result of lower software licenses revenue  which declined across all business unit segments 
the lower software licenses revenue reflected the impact of the slowing economy  which affected our industry more severely in fiscal than in fiscal in general  despite challenges posed by the current economic climate  maintenance and subscriptions revenue increased in all business unit segments except workgroup 
below is a brief summary of the revenue results in fiscal for each of our four business unit segments compared to fiscal within our open platform solutions business unit segment  total revenue increased  reflecting strong growth in our linux platform products category 
within our identity and security management business unit segment  total revenue decreased  reflecting lower software licenses and services revenues 
within our systems and resource management business unit segment  total revenue decreased  reflecting lower software licenses and services revenues 
during fiscal  revenue from the platespin and managed objects acquisitions was million 
in fiscal revenue from our platespin acquisition was million 
within our workgroup business unit segment  total revenue decreased  reflecting lower software licenses  maintenance and subscriptions  and services revenues 
during fiscal  total services revenue decreased  compared to fiscal our services offerings are focused on supporting product sales  not generating stand alone revenue or profits  which is in line with our strategic initiative of focusing our services business on driving more profitable product revenue while leveraging our services capabilities internally and through third party partners 
our prior strategy positioned our services offerings less as an enabler of software sales  and more as an independent and unrelated direct revenue initiative 
we shifted our services strategy and positioning in fiscal  with an intended gradual implementation 
as a result of this  we have seen a general decline in our services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal services revenues were also impacted by the economic climate as customers reduced their discretionary spending 
because much of the revenue we invoice is deferred and recognized over time  we consider invoicing  or bookings  to be a key indicator of current sales performance and future revenue performance 
overall invoicing was lower in all of our business unit segments for fiscal compared to fiscal  largely as a result of the economic climate as customers focused on capital conservation and expense management 
these factors have led to projects being delayed or reduced in scope  and have resulted in extended sales cycles for our customers 
while we expect these trends to continue in the near term  the fundamental markets that we serve and the value we bring to those markets remain attractive 
we believe that the current customer focus on reducing cost  complexity and risk is aligned with our overall value proposition 
additionally  the recent financial turmoil demands stricter requirements for regulation and audit  creating the potential for expanded opportunities for certain of our products 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal reflected the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives  including prior restructuring actions  and the benefits of realigning our services business to be more efficient and product focused  resulting in a shift to higher margin product revenue 
total gross profit was lower in fiscal compared to fiscal  due primarily to the decrease in total net revenue 
in fiscal  we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively  related to our systems and resource management business unit segment 
as a result of these charges  we reported an operating margin for fiscal of negative  which compares to just above break even in fiscal the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were of revenue

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued during fiscal  we recorded net restructuring expenses of million 
this was comprised of million from the completion of the restructuring plan that we began implementing in the fourth quarter of fiscal  million under our current restructuring plan  which we implemented in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in response to current economic conditions  and million for increases to accruals for changes in estimates related to prior year restructuring activities 
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires us to make an accounting estimate based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially change the financial statements 
we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition and related reserves  impairment of long term assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  loss contingency accruals and restructurings  and share based payments to be critical accounting policies due to the judgments and estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition and related reserves our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of software licenses  software maintenance  subscriptions of sles  technical support  training  and professional services 
our customers include distributors  who sell our products to resellers and vars  oems  who integrate our products with their products or solutions  vars  who provide solutions across multiple vertical market segments which usually include services  and end users  who may purchase our products and services directly from us or from other partners or resellers 
except for our suse linux product  distributors do not order to stock and only order products when they have an end customer order 
with respect to our suse linux product  distributors place orders and the product is then sold to end customers principally through the retail channel 
oems report the number of copies duplicated and sold via an activity or royalty report 
software maintenance  technical support  and subscriptions of sles typically involve one to three year contract terms 
our standard practice is to provide customers with a day general right of return 
such return provision allows for a refund and or credit of any amount paid by our customers 
when an arrangement does not require significant production  modification  or customization of software or does not contain services considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we require evidence of an agreement with a customer specifying the terms and conditions of the products or services to be delivered typically in the form of a signed contract or statement of work accompanied by a purchase order 
delivery has occurred for software licenses  delivery takes place when the customer is given access to the software programs via access to a website or shipped medium 
for services  delivery takes place as the services are provided 
the fee is fixed or determinable fees are fixed or determinable if they are not subject to cancellation or other payment terms that exceed our standard payment terms 
collection is probable we perform a credit review of all customers with significant transactions to determine whether a customer is creditworthy and collection is probable 
prior credit history with us  credit reports  financial statements  and bank references are used to assess creditworthiness 
in general  revenue for transactions that do not involve software customization or services considered essential to the functionality of the software is recognized as follows software fees for our suse linux product are recognized when the product is sold to an end customer  software license fees for sales through oems are recognized upon receipt of license activity or royalty reports  all other software license fees are recognized upon delivery of the software  software maintenance  technical support  and subscriptions of sles are recognized ratably over the contract term  and professional services  training and other similar services are recognized as the services are performed 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collection is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
we record provisions against revenue for 
table of contents novell  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
we also record a provision to operating expenses for bad debts resulting from customers inability to pay for the products or services they have received 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and bad debt expense  analyses of credit memo data  and other known factors  such as bankruptcy 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not accurately reflect future returns or bad debts  adjustments to these reserves may be required that would increase or decrease revenue or net income 
many of our software arrangements include multiple elements 
such elements typically include any or all of the following software licenses  rights to additional software products  software maintenance  technical support  training and professional services 
for multiple element arrangements that do not involve significant modification or customization of the software and do not involve services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we allocated value to each element based on its relative fair value for transactions prior to fiscal prior to the start of fiscal  we sold software licenses individually as well as combined with other products multi element arrangements  allowing us to determine vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for substantially all software license products 
accordingly  when we sold multi element arrangements we used the relative fair value  or proportional  revenue accounting method to allocate the value of multi element arrangements proportionally to the software license and other components 
at the start of fiscal  we made a sales program change requiring all customers to initially purchase maintenance with licenses  which is common industry practice 
as a result of eliminating stand alone software license sales  vsoe of fair value for software licenses no longer existed 
accordingly  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  the residual method as defined in current accounting standards is now used to allocate the value of multi element arrangements to the various components  which is also common industry practice 
under the residual method  each undelivered element typically maintenance is allocated value based on novell specific objective evidence of fair value for that element and the remainder of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element  typically the software 
this method results in discounts being allocated to the software license rather than spread proportionately over all elements 
therefore  when a discount exists  less revenue is recognized at the time of sale under the residual method than under the relative fair value method  which we used prior to fiscal we believe that the impact of the change to the residual method was not material to net revenue in fiscal if sufficient novell specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements and the arrangement involves rights to unspecified additional software products  all revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
if the arrangement does not involve rights to unspecified additional software products  all revenue is initially deferred until the only remaining undelivered element is software maintenance or technical support  at which time the entire fee is recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance or support term 
in the case of multiple element arrangements that involve significant modification or customization of the software or involve services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  contract accounting is applied 
when novell specific objective evidence of fair value exists for software maintenance or technical support in arrangements requiring contract accounting  the professional services and license fees are combined and revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
the percentage of completion is generally calculated using hours incurred to date relative to the total expected hours for the entire project 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates to complete or recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
the maintenance or support fee is unbundled from the other elements and revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance or support term 
when novell specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for software maintenance or support  then all revenue is deferred until completion of the professional services  at which time the entire fee is recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance or support period 
for consolidated statements of operations classification purposes only  we allocate the revenue first to those elements for which we have novell specific objective evidence of fair value  and any remaining recognized revenue is then allocated to those items for which we lack novell specific objective evidence of fair value 
professional services contracts are either time and materials or fixed price contracts 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized based on the proportional performance method  generally using estimated time to complete to measure the completed effort 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates to complete or recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
professional services revenue includes reimbursable expenses charged to our clients

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued microsoft agreements related revenue on november   we entered into the microsoft agreements 
each of the agreements is scheduled to expire on january  under the business collaboration agreement  we are marketing a combined offering with microsoft 
the combined offering consists of sles and a subscription for sles support along with microsoft windows server  microsoft virtual server and microsoft viridian  and is offered to customers desiring to deploy linux and windows in a virtualized setting 
microsoft made an upfront payment to us of million for sles subscription certificates  which microsoft may use  resell or otherwise distribute over the term of the agreement  allowing the certificate holder to redeem single or multi year subscriptions for sles support from us entitling the certificate holder to upgrades  updates and technical support 
microsoft agreed to spend million over the term of the agreement for marketing linux and windows virtualization scenarios and also agreed to spend million over the term of the agreement for a microsoft sales force devoted primarily to marketing the combined offering 
microsoft agreed that for three years following the initial date of the agreement it will not enter into an agreement with any other linux distributor to encourage adoption of other company s linux windows server virtualization through a program substantially similar to the sles subscription certificate distribution program 
the technical collaboration agreement focuses primarily on four areas development of technologies to optimize sles and windows  each running as guests in a virtualized setting on the other operating system  development of management tools for managing heterogeneous virtualization environments  to enable each party s management tools to command  control and configure the other party s operating system in a virtual machine environment  development of translators to improve interoperability between microsoft office and openoffice 
org document formats  and collaboration on improving directory and identity interoperability and identity management between microsoft active directory software and novell edirectory software 
under the technical collaboration agreement  microsoft agreed to provide funding to help accomplish these broad objectives  subject to certain limitations 
under the patent cooperation agreement  microsoft agreed to covenant with our customers not to assert its patents against our customers for their use of our products and services for which we receive revenue directly or indirectly  with certain exceptions  while we agreed to covenant with microsoft s customers not to assert our patents against microsoft s customers for their use of microsoft products and services for which microsoft receives revenue directly or indirectly  with certain exceptions 
in addition  we and microsoft each irrevocably released the other party  and its customers  from any liability for patent infringement arising prior to november   with certain exceptions 
both we and microsoft have payment obligations under the patent cooperation agreement 
microsoft made an upfront net balancing payment to us of million  and we are making ongoing payments to microsoft totaling a minimum of million over the five year term of the agreement based on a percentage of our open platform solutions and open enterprise server revenues 
as the three agreements are interrelated and were negotiated and executed simultaneously  for accounting purposes we considered all of the agreements to constitute one arrangement containing multiple elements 
the sles subscription purchases of million are being accounted for based on vsoe of fair value 
we recognize the revenue ratably over the respective subscription terms beginning upon customer activation  or for subscriptions which expire un activated  if any  we recognize revenue upon subscription expiration 
objective evidence of the fair value of elements within the patent cooperation agreement and technical collaboration agreement did not exist 
as such  we combined the million for the patent cooperation agreement payment and amounts we are receiving under the technical collaboration agreement and are recognizing this revenue ratably over the contractual term of the agreements of five years 
our periodic payments to microsoft are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
the contractual expenditures by microsoft  including the dedicated sales force of million and the marketing funds of million  do not obligate us to perform  and  therefore  do not have an accounting consequence to us

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued impairment of long term assets our long term assets include goodwill  net property  plant and equipment  other intangible assets  and long term investments 
at october   our long term assets included million of goodwill  million of net property  plant and equipment  million of other identifiable intangible assets  and million of long term investments 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of august  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant  such as a material adverse change in the business 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
indefinite lived intangible assets are considered impaired if their carrying value exceeds their estimated fair value 
fair values are estimated using the combination of a discounted cash flow methodology and a market analysis  and weighting the results 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process requires subjective judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
changes in reporting units and changes to the estimates used in the analyses  including estimated future cash flows  could cause one or more of the reporting units or indefinite lived intangibles to be valued differently in future periods 
future analysis could potentially result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of up to million  the full amount of our goodwill  depending on the estimated value of the reporting units and the value of the net assets attributable to those reporting units at that time 
in fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
for more information about this charge see the subsection below entitled  impairment of goodwill  in the results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal section 
net property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets we periodically review our net property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors that could indicate an impairment include significant underperformance of the asset as compared to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the actual or intended use of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset are compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount  we record an impairment charge based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  which we estimate based on discounted expected future cash flows 
in determining whether an asset is impaired  we must make assumptions regarding recoverability of costs  estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset and other related factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
for fiscal   and  we have not identified or recorded any impairment of our net property  plant and equipment 
most of our trademarks trade names have indefinite lives and therefore are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain intangible assets we acquired as part of our platespin and managed objects acquisitions 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for developed technology intangible assets that we acquired but later determined that we would not utilize as initially planned 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain intangible assets we acquired as a part of the e security acquisition 
long term investments at october  and october   all of our arss were classified as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheets  and at october   were our only long term investments 
we estimated the fair value of these arss using a discounted cash flow analysis that considered the following key inputs i the underlying structure of each security  ii the present value of the future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security  and iii consideration of the time horizon that the market value of each security could return to its cost 
when available  we also include market information and weigh this with our discounted cash flow analysis to estimate fair value 
we estimated that the fair market value of these securities at october  
table of contents novell  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued and october  was million and million  respectively 
at october   the original cost of the remaining arss was million 
during fiscal  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million  based on our assessment that it is likely that the fair value of the arss will not fully recover in the foreseeable future  given a combination of factors  including the duration  severity and continued declining trend of the fair value of these securities as well as a deterioration in some of the securities credit ratings 
during fiscal  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million 
we consider all of our other than temporary losses to be credit losses and therefore these losses have been recorded in the impairment of investments line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal  we sold two of our arss for million 
these two securities had an aggregate cost basis of million and had been entirely impaired prior to the sale 
late in fiscal  our remaining six arss had improvements in their estimated fair value resulting in a million unrealized gain 
the fair value of the arss could change in the future and we may be required to record additional other than temporary impairment charges if there are further reductions in fair value in future periods 
valuation of deferred tax assets we regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  and make significant judgments about many factors  including the amount and likelihood of future income 
based on all the available evidence  we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that most of our net deferred tax assets  and certain foreign deferred tax assets  are not currently realizable 
in reaching this determination  we evaluated our three year cumulative results as well as the impacts that current economic conditions may have on our future results 
as a result  we continue to provide a valuation reserve on our us net deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
it is reasonably possible that we could reduce a significant portion of our valuation allowance in the near term 
loss contingency accruals and restructurings we are required to make accruals for certain loss contingencies related to litigation 
we accrue for losses we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
however  the estimation of the amount to accrue requires significant judgment 
litigation accruals require us to make assumptions about the future outcome of each case based on current information 
prior to fiscal  we evaluated our tax reserves based on accounting guidance which required us to accrue for losses we believed were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
beginning in fiscal  guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements was clarified so that a company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not greater than that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
otherwise  no benefit can be recognized 
the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
additionally  companies are required to accrue interest and related penalties  if applicable  on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws 
the adoption of this guidance resulted in a million non cash adjustment to increase our reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and a reduction to beginning retained earnings in fiscal our policy for interest and penalties related to income tax exposures was not impacted as a result of the adoption of the updated recognition and measurement provisions 
interest and penalties on tax reserves continue to be classified as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
when our restructurings include leased facilities we are required to make assumptions about future sublease income  which would offset our costs and decrease our accrual 
during fiscal and fiscal  we recorded net increases of million and million  respectively  to increase accruals related to facility reserves due to changes in facts and circumstances 
share based payments under the fair value recognition guidance of stock based compensation accounting rules  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we use the black scholes model to value both service condition and performance condition option awards 
for awards with only service 
table of contents novell  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued conditions and graded vesting features  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance conditions  we recognize stock based compensation expense based on the graded vesting method 
determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected terms 
the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical and implied volatilities of our common stock 
the expected term represents the average time that options that vest are expected to be outstanding based on the vesting provisions and our historical exercise  cancellation and expiration patterns 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures when recognizing stock based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors 
we update these assumptions at least on an annual basis and on an interim basis if significant changes to the assumptions are warranted 
we issue performance based equity awards  typically to senior executives  which vest upon the achievement of certain financial performance goals  including revenue and income targets 
determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of the stated goals requires judgment  including forecasting future financial results 
the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate 
the cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change 
if the financial performance goals are not met  the award does not vest  so no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized stock based compensation expense is reversed

no further payments are due from the ctp switzerland buyout group 
as of january   we ceased stockholder and operational relationships with ctp switzerland 
when we signed the agreement  we began classifying ctp switzerland s results as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of operations and reclassified our results of operations for the prior comparable period 
in fiscal  we recognized an estimated loss on disposal of million resulting from the expected sale 
during fiscal  we recognized a gain on final liquidation of ctp switzerland of million  for a total net loss on the disposition of million 
salmon on march   we sold our shares in our wholly owned salmon subsidiary to okam limited  a uk limited holding company  for million  which amount has been received  plus an additional contingent payment of million approximately million

during fiscal  we received an additional contingent cash payment of million 
we earned the remaining balance during fiscal  for which a receivable of approximately million was recorded and is due to be paid to us during fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we determined that it was more likely than not that salmon would be sold 
this determination triggered the need to test the million of goodwill related to salmon for impairment 
using an estimate of proceeds to be received upon sale as an indicator of salmon s fair value  we determined that million of salmon s goodwill had become impaired  and was  therefore  written off during the quarter as a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we also determined that million of customer relationship intangible assets and million of non compete agreement intangible assets had become impaired and  therefore  were also written off in the first quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized a gain on the consummation of the sale of approximately million

in our consolidated statements of operations  we categorize revenue as software licenses  maintenance and subscriptions  and services 
software licenses revenue includes sales of proprietary licenses and certain royalties 
maintenance and subscriptions revenue includes product maintenance agreements and linux subscriptions 
services revenue includes professional services  technical support  and training 
fiscal year ended october  dollars in thousands change software licenses maintenance and subscriptions services total net revenue our overall revenue decline of in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflected the impact of the economic climate 
it is reasonably possible that this revenue decline could continue into fiscal revenue in our software licenses category decreased during fiscal compared to the prior year as software licenses revenue declined across all business unit segments 
the lower software licenses revenue reflected the impact of the economic climate  which affected our industry more severely in fiscal than in fiscal revenue from maintenance and subscriptions increased in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to increased revenue from linux platform products  which increased million  or 
maintenance and subscriptions revenue increased in all of our business unit segments except workgroup in fiscal compared to the prior year 
in general  despite challenges posed by the economic climate  maintenance and subscriptions revenue continued at relatively steady rates due primarily to consistent renewal rates with respect to existing software deployments 
revenue from maintenance and subscriptions also benefited from our acquisitions 
incremental maintenance and subscriptions revenue in the first year after acquiring platespin and from managed objects accounted for million of new revenue 
while our services offerings are focused increasingly on supporting product sales  rather than generating stand alone revenue or profits  the decline in services revenue in fiscal compared to the prior year was greater than anticipated as customers reduced their discretionary spending in response to economic conditions

general and administrative headcount was lower by employees  or  at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting the outsourcing of the majority of our it support functions to acs as part of the agreement that was signed in the third quarter of fiscal the acs agreement 
this decrease in headcount related expense was offset by an increase in outside service costs as a result of the acs agreement 
restructuring expenses during fiscal  we recorded net restructuring expenses of million 
this was comprised of million in restructuring expenses under our current restructuring plan  which we began implementing in the third quarter of fiscal in response to economic conditions  million for restructuring actions incurred for the completion of the restructuring plan that we began during the fourth quarter of fiscal and completed during the second quarter of fiscal  and million in additions to accruals for changes in estimates related to prior period restructuring activities 
as part of both restructuring actions  during fiscal  we reduced our headcount by employees 
at october   our total headcount was approximately  impairment of goodwill on august   and  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test 
the first step step one in evaluating impairment is to determine if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit  which is equivalent to our business unit segments as this is the level at which our chief decision makers review financial information  is less than the carrying value of the business unit segments 
if step one indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the business unit segment  then impairment potentially exists  and the second step step two is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
to estimate the fair value of each of our four business unit segments for step one  management made estimates and judgments about future cash flows based on assumptions that are consistent with both short term plans and long range forecasts used to manage the business 
we also considered factors such as our market capitalization and current economic events in assessing the fair value of the business unit segments 
this process requires subjective judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
changes to the estimates used in the analysis  including estimated future cash flows  could cause one or more of the business unit segments or indefinite lived intangibles to be valued differently in future periods 
based on the results of our analysis  we determined that no goodwill impairment existed at august of each fiscal year 

table of contents novell  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal continued events subsequent to annual goodwill impairment test as of august  in the week leading up to the september  board of directors annual budget meeting  management updated its long range forecast concurrent with the completion of the fiscal budgeting process 
management reduced its long range revenue growth assumptions late in the annual planning process due to present company trends  a revised market outlook and continued economic uncertainty 
management s revised long range forecast lowered the projected revenue and operating income utilized in the august  discounted cash flow model valuation 
we considered this lowered financial outlook to be an impairment trigger event for both goodwill and long lived assets  requiring us to re perform the step one test for potential impairment  which we did as of september   our closest balance sheet date 
also  because long term revenue projections were lowered in all four of our business unit segments  each business unit segment had to be reviewed for potential impairment 
as discussed under goodwill impairment test as of september  below  the lower long term projections resulted in the failure of the step one test for our systems and resource management business unit segment because the estimated fair value of this business unit segment was lower than its carrying value 
all other business unit segments passed the step one test 
because the systems and resource management business unit segment failed the step one test  we were required to perform the step two test  which utilizes a notional purchase price allocation using the estimated fair value from step one as the purchase price to determine the implied value of the business unit segment s goodwill 
the completion of the step two test resulted in the determination that million of the systems and resource management business unit segment s goodwill was impaired 
the million impairment charge is shown in the line item impairment of goodwill in our consolidated statements of operations 
while we believe that systems and resource management business unit segment revenues can grow at or above market growth rates in the future  this growth was not sufficient to avoid failing the step one test 
we continue to believe that our growth businesses can grow at or above market rates in the future due in part to our strategic focus with these technologies 
goodwill impairment test as of september  in performing step one of the goodwill impairment test  it was necessary to determine the fair value of each of the four business unit segments 
the fair values of all business unit segments  except for the workgroup business unit segment  were estimated using a weighted average of a discounted cash flow methodology dcf and a market analysis 
the market analysis included looking at the valuations of comparable public companies  as well as recent acquisitions of comparable companies 
for the workgroup business unit segment only  the dcf was utilized as it was felt that there was no comparable market information  due to the uniqueness of the workgroup business unit segment which is forecasted to have a long term declining revenue stream  yet have high operating margins 
with respect to the other three business unit segments  a weighting was given to the market analysis  unlike the prior year  when a weighting of was utilized  as solid comparable market data is not available due to the uniqueness of each of our business unit segments 
as a result  a weighting of was given to the dcf 
two key inputs to the dcf analysis were our future cash flow projection and the discount rate 
we used a ten year future cash flow projection  based on management s long range forecast  discounted to present value  and an estimate of terminal values  which was also discounted to present value 
terminal values represent the present value an investor would pay today for the rights to cash flows of the business unit segment for the years subsequent to the ten year cash flow projection period 
as noted above  the long range forecast that was utilized for the impairment test after the september  board meeting was lower than what was utilized in both the august  valuation and the fiscal valuation 
the lower forecast was the primary reason for the lower fair values that resulted in the need to perform a step two impairment valuation for the systems and resource management business unit segment 
a driver of the lower forecast for the systems and resource management business unit segment was the underperformance of our zenworks products as well as our recent acquisitions 
the other major input into the dcf analysis was the discount rate  which was determined by estimating each business unit segment s weighted average cost of capital  reflecting the nature of the respective business unit segment and the perceived risk of the underlying cash flows 
we used the following discount rates in our dcf methodology for each of our business unit segments for open platform solutions  for identity and security management  for systems and resource management and for workgroup 
if we had increased our discount rates by  it would not have impacted the ultimate results of our step one test 
the

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal continued excess of the fair value over the carrying value of our business unit segments was as follows for open platform solutions  for identity and security management  and for workgroup 
the step two test involves allocating the fair value of the systems and resource management business unit segment to all of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis  with the excess amount representing the implied value of goodwill 
as part of this process the fair value of the systems and resource management business unit segment s identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  developed technology  customer relationships and trademarks trade names were determined 
the fair values of these assets were determined primarily through the use of the dcf method 
the fair values of systems and resource management s property  plant and equipment were determined primarily through the use of third party broker quotes 
the fair value of systems and resource management s deferred revenue was based upon the estimate of the amount that would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation 
after determining the fair value of all systems and resource management business unit segment assets and liabilities  it was determined that the implied value of goodwill was million 
the september  carrying value of the systems and resource management business unit segment s goodwill was million  which  when compared to the implied goodwill value of million resulted in the impairment charge of million 
the above described process requires subjective judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
changes to the estimates used in the analysis  including estimated future cash flows  could cause one or more of the business unit segments or indefinite lived intangibles to be valued differently in future periods 
it is at least reasonably possible that future analyses could result in additional material non cash goodwill impairment charges 
review of long lived assets as noted above  we concurrently performed an assessment of long lived assets for impairment 
these assets  which include tangible and intangible assets  need to be tested for impairment before the step two goodwill impairment analysis can be completed because any change in these assets would impact the carrying value of the systems and resource management business unit segment 
to test the recoverability of our long lived assets and liabilities  which for us is primarily long lived assets  they were grouped with other assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
with the exception of our systems and resource management business unit segment  we determined that our asset groups were our business unit segments  as that was the lowest level at which cash flows could be separated from other assets 
for the systems and resource management business unit segment  separate identifiable cash flows were available for platespin and managed objects products  with all other cash flows belonging to our remaining systems and resource management business primarily zenworks 
therefore  the systems and resource management business unit segment had three asset groups 
the test for recoverability compares undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset group to its carrying value 
the future cash flow period was based on the future service life of the primary asset within the long lived asset group 
if the future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset group  the asset group is not considered to be impaired 
if the carrying values of the asset group exceed the future cash flows  the asset group is considered to be potentially impaired 
it was determined that for all asset groups except for platespin and managed objects  the future cash flows exceeded the carrying values of the respective asset groups 
as the platespin and managed objects asset groups had carrying values in excess of their estimated undiscounted future cash flows  it was necessary to determine the fair value of the individual assets within the asset group 
because the aggregate fair values of the individual assets of the group were less than their carrying values  an impairment was recorded equal to the excess of the aggregated carrying value of the asset group over the aggregate fair value 
this loss was allocated to each asset within the group that had a fair value less than its carrying value  based on their relative carrying values  with no asset reduced below its fair value 
as a result of this test  it was determined that million of platespin s and million of managed objects developed technology and customer relationships were impaired 
these impairment charges  totaling million  are shown in the line item  impairment of intangible assets in our consolidated statements of operations 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we acquired million of developed technology  which was integrated into our identity and security management business unit segment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed our detailed internal reviews of

these reviews determined that only a portion of the acquired developed technology would be utilized in our products 
we used discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair value of this acquired developed technology based upon the updated plans  and determined that million had become impaired 
this intangible asset was written down and the related charge was recorded as a component of operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal the entire million impairment charge related to the identity and security management business unit segment 
as part of this review  it was determined that the estimated useful life of the remaining asset would be four years

as a result  this amount was expensed upon acquisition 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal compared to fiscal unfavorably impacted revenue by million  favorably impacted operating expenses by million and favorably impacted income from continuing operations by million 
since a large portion of our recognized revenue is deferred revenue that was recorded at different foreign currency exchange rates  the impact to revenue of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recognized over time  whereas the impact to expenses is more immediate  as expenses are recognized at the current foreign currency exchange rate in effect at the time the expense is incurred

income tax expense on income from continuing operations fiscal year ended october  dollars in thousands change income tax expense effective tax rate the effective tax rate on continuing operations for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the fiscal rate of is the result of recording tax expense on a pre tax book loss 
this was primarily due to the million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded for book purposes in fiscal for which we received minimal current tax benefit 
in the us these impairment charges are either non deductible or deductible over years with a valuation allowance on the deferred asset  and outside the us these impairment charges are attributable to jurisdictions where we receive little or no tax benefit 
in fiscal we had significant book to tax differences that increased fiscal taxable income primarily as a result of a large one time cash payment to us in fiscal that we deferred for tax purposes to fiscal because of these book to tax differences  we recorded significantly higher tax expense in the us in fiscal when compared to fiscal  resulting in the higher overall effective tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal included in the fiscal effective tax rate are million in adjustments related to settlements of prior period audits and tax filings 
we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that most of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized based on all available evidence 
as a result  we have provided a valuation allowance on those us net deferred tax assets 
in reaching this determination  we evaluated our three year cumulative results  pre tax losses in recent quarters  as well as the impacts that current economic conditions may have on our future results 
it is reasonably possible that we could reduce a significant portion of our valuation allowance in the near term

contractual maturities for these arss are years or greater

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued with an interest rate reset date approximately every to days 
with the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  our arss have experienced multiple failed auctions 
during fiscal  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges on our arss of million  based on our assessment that it is likely that the fair value of the arss will not fully recover in the foreseeable future  given a combination of factors  including the duration  severity and continued declining trend of the fair value of these securities as well as a deterioration in some of the securities credit ratings 
during fiscal  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million 
we consider all of our other than temporary losses to be credit losses and therefore these losses have been recorded in the impairment of investments line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimated that the fair market value of these securities at october  and october  was million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we sold two of our arss for million 
these two securities had an aggregate cost basis of million and had been entirely impaired prior to the sale 
late in fiscal  our remaining six arss had improvements in their estimated fair value resulting in a million unrealized gain

the fair value of the arss could change in the future and we may be required to record additional other than temporary impairment charges if there are further reductions in fair value in future periods

the fund manager continued to distribute cash on a pro rata basis to the fund s stockholders as the underlying securities matured 
those distributions that were forecasted to be received more than twelve months after the balance sheet date were classified as a long term investment on our consolidated balance sheets 
at october   the short term and long term portions of this fund were million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we received distributions at par for the remaining million balance of the fund 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other potential sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity in our arss will affect our ability to operate our business in the usual course over the next twelve months 
in relation to the appeal we filed in the amer jneid legal matter  we were required by the court to post a million bond during fiscal see note s  legal proceedings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

during the first quarter of fiscal  we purchased and retired million face value of the debentures under this plan for total cash consideration of million  including less than million of accrued interest

our principal sources of liquidity continue to be from operating activities  cash on hand  and short term investments 
at october   our principal unused sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  of which million is held in accounts outside the united states and would be subject to punitive taxation if repatriated 
our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are principally for financing of property  plant and equipment  repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase plan  payments under our restructuring plans  product development investments  and maintaining flexibility in a dynamic and competitive operating environment  including pursuing potential acquisition and investment opportunities 
barring unforeseen circumstances  we anticipate being able to fund these liquidity needs for the next twelve months with existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments together with cash generated from operating activities and investment income 
we believe that offerings of equity or debt securities are possible for expenditures beyond the next twelve months  if the need arises  although such offerings may not be available to us on acceptable terms and are dependent on market conditions at such time

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued subsequent event on december   we announced a reorganization of our structure and management to better align our business with our strategic objective of becoming an industry leader in the emerging iwm market  while continuing to develop collaboration solutions 
these changes are designed to simplify the organization and provide a clear focus on markets that leverage our strengths to capture future opportunities for growth 
effective january   we will consolidate our business unit segments from four to two 
our current identity and security management  systems and resource management and open platform solutions business unit segments will be integrated to create the new security  management and operating platforms business unit segment 
our current workgroup business unit segment will be renamed collaboration solutions 
as of the filing of this annual report on form k  we have not yet finalized our reporting units for financial statement reporting purposes as a result of these organizational changes 
in accordance with segment reporting accounting guidance  we are required to perform a goodwill impairment review when our operating segments change 
we presently do not expect to incur any goodwill impairment charges as a result of this reorganization in the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and market prices of equity securities 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize currency forward contracts and currency options 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding at october  interest rate risk the primary objective of our short term investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our strategy is to invest in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
with what we believe to be the conservative nature of our investments and our strong cash and short term investment position  we believe that we are in a good position to endure the current economic conditions  barring unforeseen circumstances 
market risk we have experienced market risk and liquidity issues related to our investment funds 
see the liquidity and capital resources section in management s discussion and analysis for more detail on these investments 
we hold available for sale equity securities in our short term investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan 
as of october   the gross unrealized loss before tax effect on the short term public equity securities totaled million 
a reduction in prices of of these short term equity securities would result in an approximately million decrease less than in the fair value of our short term investments 
as a result of the failure of the auctions for our arss  and the ensuing duration  severity and continued decline of the fair value of these securities  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on our arss in fiscal we estimate that these securities have a fair value of million at october  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings significantly deteriorate  we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of these investments and recognize additional other than temporary declines in fair value 
during fiscal  we sold two of our arss for million 
these two securities had an aggregate cost basis of million and had been entirely impaired prior to the sale 
at october   the original cost of the remaining arss was million 
we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize our market risk on our investment portfolio 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other potential sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business in the usual course in the next twelve months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued foreign currency risk we use derivatives to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when re measured or settled according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  impact our consolidated statements of operations 
currency forward contracts are utilized in our hedging program and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
gains and losses on currency forward contracts should generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses on the net foreign currency assets and liabilities that they hedge  resulting in negligible net gain or loss overall on the hedged exposures 
gains and losses on currency forward contracts used in our hedging program are recognized in other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period that the gains and losses on the re measurement of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our hedging program reduces  but does not always entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
if we do not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements  an increase or decrease of in exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in income before taxes of approximately million 
this number represents the exposure related to balance sheet re measurements only and assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
we do not currently hedge currency risk related to revenues or expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal  compared to fiscal  unfavorably impacted revenue by million  favorably impacted operating expenses by million and favorably impacted loss income from continuing operations by million 
if the us dollar were to strengthen  it is anticipated that the impact to revenue would be approximately 
this assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time and the ratio of non us dollar denominated revenue and expenses to non us dollar denominated revenue and expenses does not change from current levels 
since a large portion of our recognized revenue is deferred revenue that is recorded at different foreign currency exchange rates  the impact to revenue of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recognized over time  whereas the impact to expenses is more immediate  as expenses are recognized at the current foreign currency exchange rate in effect at the time the expense is incurred 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at october  actual results may differ materially
