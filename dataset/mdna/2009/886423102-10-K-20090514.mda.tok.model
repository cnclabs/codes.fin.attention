item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of march  and and for the years ended march   and included in item of this form k 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s future results of operations could differ materially from its historical results or current expectations than those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
with respect to this section  the cautionary language applicable to such forward looking statements described in a caution about forward looking statements found before item of this form k is incorporated by reference into this item the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
our business the company provides offshore service vessels and equipment to the global offshore energy industry through the operation of a diversified fleet of marine service vessels 
tidewater is one of the most internationally diverse companies in the offshore energy industry with over five decades of international experience and a total of vessels servicing the energy industry 
the company s revenues  net earnings and cash flows from operations are dependent upon the activity level of the vessel fleet 
like other energy service companies  the level of the company s business activity is driven by the level of drilling and exploration activity by our customers 
their activity  in turn  is dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices  which fluctuate depending on levels of supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas 
the company s revenues are driven primarily by the company s fleet size  vessel utilization and day rates 
because a sizeable portion of the company s operating costs including depreciation does not change proportionally with changes in revenue  the company s operating profit is largely dependent on revenue levels 
operating costs consist primarily of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance and loss reserves  fuel  lube oil and supplies and vessel operating lease expense 
fleet size  fleet composition  geographic areas of operation and the supply and demand for marine personnel are the major factors which affect overall crew costs 
in addition  the company s newer  technologically sophisticated anchor handling towing supply vessels and platform supply vessels generally require a greater number of specially trained fleet personnel than the company s older smaller vessels 
competition for skilled crew may intensify  particularly in international markets  as new build support vessels are currently under construction and approximately are scheduled to enter the global fleet during calendar year if competition for personnel intensifies  the company s crew costs will likely increase 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by customer demand  vessel age and safety and inspection drydockings mandated by regulatory agencies 
a certain number of drydockings are required over a given period to meet regulatory requirements 
drydocking costs are incurred only if the company believes a drydocking is economically justified  taking into consideration the vessel s age  physical condition and future marketability 
if the company elects not to perform a required drydocking  the company will either stack or sell the vessel  as it is not permitted to work without the proper certifications 
when the company takes a productive vessel out of service for drydocking  the company incurs not only the drydocking cost but also continues to incur operating costs and depreciation on the vessel 
the company generally foregoes revenue from that vessel during the drydock period 
in any given period  downtime associated with drydockings and major repairs and maintenance can have a significant effect on the company s revenues and operating costs 
drydockings have taken on an increasing importance to the company and its financial performance 
the company s older vessels  for which demand remained relatively strong during fiscal  require more frequent and more expensive repair and drydockings  while some of its newer vessels  which were built after  are now experiencing their first or second required regulatory drydockings 
the combination of these factors has increased the company s expenditures for drydockings and incrementally increased the volatility 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of the company s operating revenues and operating costs  thus making period to period comparisons more difficult 
although the company attempts to efficiently manage its fleet drydocking schedule to minimize the disruptive effect  inflationary pressures in shipyard pricing experienced in recent years and the heavy workloads at the shipyards resulted in increased drydocking costs  and increased days off hire at shipyards thereby  increasing the company s loss of revenue on the drydocked vessel 
due to the global recession  the company does not know if the shipyard situation will improve in the foreseeable future 
if there is no improvement  the company expects that the timing of drydockings in the future will result in continued quarterly volatility in repair and maintenance costs and loss in revenue 
fuel and lube costs can also fluctuate in any given period depending on the number of vessel mobilizations that occur 
insurance and loss reserves costs are dependent on the company s safety record and can fluctuate from time to time 
the company s vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss resulting from catastrophic marine disaster  adverse weather conditions  mechanical failure  collisions  and property losses to the vessel 
the company also incurs vessel operating costs which are aggregated under the other vessel operating cost heading 
these costs consist of brokers commissions  training costs and other costs 
brokers commission costs are incurred primarily in the company s international operations where brokers assist in obtaining work for the company s vessels 
brokers are paid a percentage of day rates and  accordingly  commissions paid to brokers increase as the company s revenues increase 
other costs include  but are not limited to  satellite communication fees  agent fees  port fees  canal transit fees  vessel certification fees and temporary vessel importation fees 
fiscal business highlights and key focus during fiscal  the company continued its focus on increasing its presence in international markets  maintaining its competitive advantage and modernizing its vessel fleet in order to generate future earnings capacity 
the company is effectively utilizing its strong cash position to support the construction of the industry s largest fleet of new vessels 
operating management focuses on improving day rates and utilization and maintaining disciplined cost control 
during fiscal  the company recorded billion in revenues  which is an increase of approximately million  or  over its fiscal revenues 
this increase reflects the strong industry fundamentals that were present in the first half of fiscal  primarily in the company s international markets  which pushed total average day rates approximately higher than the total average day rates achieved during fiscal fiscal consolidated net earnings increased approximately  or million  as compared to fiscal the company s international operations continue to be the primary driver of its earnings and  during fiscal  revenues generated from international vessel operations as a percentage of the company s total revenues were 
the company s united states results of operations are primarily dependent on the demand and supply relationship for natural gas 
the company s us based revenues decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to a decrease in the number of vessels operating in the us based portion of the gulf of mexico gom and to an approximate percentage point decrease in utilization rates on the remaining us based vessels despite an approximate increase in average day rates 
us based operating profit increased approximately  or million  due to approximately lower vessel operating costs and approximately lower depreciation expense 
the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the demand and supply relationship for crude oil 
during fiscal  international based revenues and operating profit increased approximately and  or million and million  respectively  as compared to fiscal  due to strong market fundamentals during the first half of fiscal  which resulted in vessel day rate escalations and increases in the number of vessels operating internationally because of vessel transfers from the us market and the addition of newly constructed vessels that were added to the fleet 
fiscal international based vessel revenues increases were partially offset by approximately higher operating costs and higher depreciation expense  as compared to fiscal  due primarily to an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally

index to financial statements in january  the us district court for the eastern district of louisiana issued its final ruling in the company s favor with respect to a motion for summary judgment concerning the irs disallowance of the company s tax deduction for foreign sales corporation commissions for fiscal years and in march of  the irs appealed the verdict to the fifth circuit court of appeals  which in april of  affirmed the district court s judgment 
the irs has days within which to file a petition for review with the united states supreme court 
although the ultimate settlement of the liability is unpredictable  it is reasonably possible that this uncertainty will be resolved within the next twelve months 
if this uncertainty is ultimately resolved in the company s favor  the company anticipates reversing its liability recorded for this issue  which includes liabilities recorded for similar deductions taken in years subsequent to fiscal as of march   the amount of the potential reversal  including interest  is approximately million 
the company s strategy contemplates organic growth through the construction of vessels at a variety of shipyards worldwide and possible acquisitions of vessels and or other owners and operators of offshore supply vessels 
the company has the largest number of new vessels among its competitors in the industry  and it also has the largest fleet of older vessels in the industry 
because the company has a large number of older vessels  management regularly evaluates alternatives for its older fleet 
the company will continue to pursue its long term growth strategies on a disciplined basis and  in each case  will carefully consider whether proposed investments and transactions have the appropriate risk reward profile 
the company s safety performance improved significantly during fiscal during fiscal  the company experienced only one lost time accident compared to eight lost time accidents which included six fatalities during fiscal the company is committed to continuing to improve its record for the safety of the company s employees and the safety of its customers 
the company s principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment presents safety challenges 
because the environment presents these challenges  the company works diligently to maintain workplace safety 
management regularly communicates with its personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits through company media and safety review sessions 
the company also regularly conducts safety training meetings for its seamen and shore staff personnel 
in  the company has continued a significant vessel construction and acquisition program that began in calendar year this program has facilitated the company s entrance into deepwater markets around the world in addition to allowing the company to begin to replace its core fleet with fewer  larger  and more technologically sophisticated vessels 
the vessel construction and acquisition program and the expansion program were initiated with the intent of strengthening the company s presence in all major oil and gas producing regions of the world through the replacement of aging vessels in the company s core fleet 
during this decade  the company has purchased and or constructed vessels for approximately billion 
between april and march  the company also sold  primarily to buyers who operate outside of our industry  vessels and scrapped or disposed of vessels 
most of the vessel sales were at prices that exceeded their carrying values 
to date  the company has funded all of its vessel commitment programs from current cash balances  operating cash flow  and funds provided by its million senior unsecured notes  its revolving credit facility  and various leasing arrangements 
at march   the company had vessels under construction for a total capital commitment of million  of which the company has already expended million 
a full discussion of the company s capital commitments  scheduled delivery dates and vessel sales is disclosed in the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
in july  the company s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million in shares of its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the company will use its available cash and  when considered advantageous  borrowings under its revolving credit facility or other borrowings  to fund any share repurchases 
the repurchase program will end on the earlier of the date that all authorized funds have been expended or june   unless extended by the board of directors 
during fiscal  million was used to repurchase shares of the company s stock  however  no amounts were expended under the most recent share repurchase authorization during the year ended march  at march   million was available to repurchase shares of the company s common stock pursuant to the july authorized stock repurchase program 
the company will continue

macroeconomic environment and outlook during the last half of calendar  worldwide demand for oil and gas dropped precipitously and energy prices sharply declined as a result of a global economic recession 
the company continues to evaluate how a prolonged global recession might affect the development plans of exploration and production companies and global demand for offshore vessels 
the company also continues to evaluate the potential impacts of the global recession and distress in credit and capital markets on the ability of shipyards to meet their scheduled deliveries of new vessels or the ability of the company to renew its fleet through new vessel construction or acquisitions 
also unknown is the potential effect that the recession may have on the company s more highly leveraged competitors  including those companies ability to continue to fund their construction commitments 
assessing the current situation with a high degree of confidence is challenging given the instability in the financial and commodity markets and the global economic recession 
the recession may ultimately result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services which would reduce charter rates and or utilization rates and therefore have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation and financial condition 
during fiscal  the company did not experience any significant negative effects from the financial crisis or tight credit markets 
trends in exploration  development and production activity  however  are generally negative and customers are actively seeking pricing concessions in regards to services provided by the company 
given the foregoing uncertainties  the company continues to re assess its stated strategies and investment plans 
all statements made herein of the previously stated plans or the current plan or expectation of such should be considered in the light of the potential effects discussed in the preceding paragraph 
while the magnitude of any change in plans  including investment plans  cannot be predicted at this time  it is likely that some adjustments will be necessary due to the global recession  the recent dramatic reduction in commodity prices  and the lack of liquidity in financial markets 
the company operates in a highly competitive business environment that has many risks as disclosed in item a of this report 
the number of operating drilling rigs in the us offshore market is generally the primary driver of the company s expected activity levels and future profitability in the us market 
the offshore rig count in the gom remains at historically low levels  in part  because the strength of the international drilling market has attracted numerous offshore drilling rigs from the us to various international markets over the past few years 
in addition  exploration and development activity in the gom has fallen off significantly  particularly in non deepwater areas 
as a consequence  the demand for offshore marine vessels in the shallow water gom diminished and is expected to remain weak  unless recent trends are reversed 
over the longer term  the company s us based fleet should be affected more by the active offshore rig count in the united states than by any other single outside influence 
in addition  consolidation could result in the absorption of an oil and gas company with which the company has a strong commercial relationship into another company with which the company does not have such a relationship 
the prices of crude oil and natural gas are critical factors in e p companies decisions to retain their drilling rigs in the gom market or mobilize the rigs to international markets 
the company s united states results of operations are primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship for natural gas  while the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship of crude oil 
prices for crude oil and natural gas have fallen dramatically from their respective peaks achieved in calendar year due to a global recession that has caused a precipitous drop in worldwide demand for oil and gas 
before the recession onset  natural gas prices had declined because inventory levels for natural gas increased more than expected during the summer season largely due to strong  land based natural gas drilling results 
production shut ins in the offshore drilling market caused by hurricanes gustav and ike eased some of the production growth but were insufficient to offset the natural gas supplied by land based drillers 
inventories continued at high levels even during the winter drawdown season  despite a relatively cold winter  due to the strong supply growth and declining demand resulting from the recession 
natural gas prices were in the range of to per mcf in mid april  a significant decline from its peak of per mcf in july analysts expect gas prices to deteriorate further during calendar year 
table of contents 
index to financial statements until forced production shut ins reverse gas supplies or demand increases 
given the historically strong correlation between commodity prices  drilling and exploration activity and demand for the company s vessels in the gom  if gas prices remain weak during calendar year  the company expects utilization rates and day rates for its vessels in the gom market will continue to be depressed and  as such  management is unable to predict with confidence what the company s actual experience will be in calendar year crude oil prices had also retreated from the all time closing high of approximately per barrel in mid july and were in the to range in mid april opec responded to falling crude prices by cutting production by million barrels per day a nearly cut in global oil supplies as of january  in an effort to stabilize prices 
it is unknown whether crude oil prices will stabilize at levels that will continue to support significant levels of exploration and production spending by oil and gas companies 
in addition  even if prices stabilize at levels that do support high levels of spending  it is uncertain if e p companies will be able to sustain their level of capital expenditures because of reductions in available capital and liquidity 
given the historical strong correlation between commodity prices  drilling and exploration activity and demand for the company s vessels in the various international markets  if crude oil prices remain weak during calendar year  the company expects that utilization and day rates for its international based vessels will weaken 
however  with the volatility of oil pricing and demand  management is unable to predict what the company s actual experience will be in calendar year oil and gas industry analysts have reported in their e p expenditures both land based and offshore surveys that global capital expenditures are forecast to decline by approximately from calendar year levels 
the surveys forecast that international capital spending will decline modestly  while north american capital spending is forecast to decrease more than due to the continuing uncertainty in commodity pricing  tight credit markets and the global recession 
in addition  these spending estimates may prove to be overly optimistic as they were based on average assumptions of approximately per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas price for calendar the gom market consists primarily of the independents and smaller companies that employ more financial leverage and  as such  may face challenges raising capital funding for their respective drilling programs 
the company s assets are highly mobile 
should the us market weaken further  the company has the ability to redeploy some of its vessels to international markets where  market conditions permitting  the vessels may benefit from stronger demand and average day rates and statutory income tax rates that are typically lower than in the united states 
the company will continue to assess the demand for vessels in the gom and in the various international markets and consider relocating additional vessels to international areas  although the ability of the company to continue to mobilize vessels among international markets will be subject to global market demand 
the cost of mobilizing vessels to a different market are sometimes for the account of the company and sometimes for the account of a contracting customer 
during the quarter ended september   both us president bush and the us congress allowed the moratorium on offshore drilling in federal waters along the us pacific and atlantic coasts to expire effective october  although the lifting of the moratorium will not result in immediate drilling  the prospects for the future of offshore drilling in the new regions of the us could be promising  however  in january  us president obama took office  and it is not yet clear what the energy policy of his administration will be or what impact such policy will have on the offshore energy industry 
the deepwater offshore energy market is a growing segment of the energy market 
worldwide rig construction escalated in the past few years as rig owners capitalized on the high worldwide demand for drilling 
reports published during the most recently completed quarter suggest that over the next four years  the worldwide moveable drilling rig count will increase as new build rigs currently on order and under construction stand at approximately rigs  which will supplement the current approximately movable rigs worldwide 
in addition  investment is also being made in the floating production market where approximately new floating production units are currently under construction and are expected to be delivered over the next five years to supplement the current approximately floating production units worldwide 
given the recent financial crisis and global economic recession  it is possible that some of the drilling rigs currently on order might be delayed or cancelled 
moreover  to the extent built and delivered  it is believed that the new build rigs will largely target international regions rather than the gom due to longer 
table of contents 
index to financial statements contract durations  generally lower operating costs and higher drilling day rates available in the international markets 
approximately new build support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only are currently under construction and are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market over the next four years according to by ods petrodata 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels 
an increase in vessel capacity could have the effect of lowering charter rates  particularly in the context of declining levels of exploration  development and production activity 
however  the worldwide offshore marine vessel industry has a large number of aging vessels  including approximately that are at least years old  that are nearing or exceeding original expectations of estimated economic lives 
these older vessels could potentially retire from the market within the next few years if the cost of extending the vessels lives is not economically justifiable 
although the future attrition rate of these aging vessels cannot be accurately predicted  the company believes that the retirement of a portion of these aging vessels would likely mitigate the potential negative impacts that new build vessels and reduced exploration  development and production activity may have on offshore support vessel demand 
additional vessel demand should be created with the addition of new drilling rigs and floating production units over the next few years  which should help minimize the negative effects of new build support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only being added to the offshore support vessel fleet 
however  it is unknown at this time how the global recession will influence the utilization of equipment currently in existence or the ultimate delivery and placing into service of new drilling rigs  floating production units and vessels currently under construction

general market conditions demand for the company s vessels in the shallow water gom offshore vessel market steadily diminished over the past three years as numerous drilling rigs migrated to international areas to capitalize on strong market fundamentals 
in response to the drilling rigs departure from the gom  the company relocated vessels including two deepwater vessels to international locations during fiscal  where the vessels secured more attractive term contracts at generally higher day rates 
a net seven vessels were transferred to international locations during fiscal and vessels during fiscal although the number of drilling rigs in the gom is low  the market for offshore vessels tightened during the summer of due to an increase in e p drilling activity resulting from high natural gas prices  which reached the per mcf range in july  but have since fallen to the to range by mid april then  in september  hurricanes gustav and ike hit the louisiana and texas coasts 
the us minerals management service reported that the damage sustained to the energy infrastructure would take several months to repair 
the market for offshore support vessels was tight prior to the two storms  and there were shortages in available for work offshore vessels operating in the gom 
the resulting offshore vessels supply demand fundamentals pushed vessel day rates higher in the gom 
at the time  the gom supply boat market had a significant number of vessels previously stacked that could have resumed active status after drydocking and recertification 
all of the company s available for work us based vessels were working at relatively full utilization prior to the storms  and  after the storms  two of the company s stacked vessels were drydocked and re certificated to respond to increased post hurricane market demand 
demand for the company s vessels was brisk for the majority of the company s fiscal second and third quarters  but demand waned in the last weeks of december due partially to the winding down of repair work on the offshore energy infrastructure 
during december and throughout the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company experienced day rate and utilization weakness on its us based vessels that provide service in the gom shallow and mid water depths 
international based vessel day rates averaged higher during fiscal  due largely to an increase in drilling activity in the international markets 
in  capital spending budgets for exploration and production which were based on strong crude oil pricing during the first half of the price of crude oil peaked at per barrel in mid july and has since fallen to the to range by mid april opec responded to falling crude prices by cutting production in an effort to stabilize prices 
it is unknown whether crude oil prices will stabilize at levels that will continue to support significant levels of exploration and production spending by oil and gas companies 
demand for the company s vessels in the various international markets was strong during most of fiscal  but started showing some signs of weakness as the fiscal year ended 
united states based operations the company s us based vessel revenues decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to fewer vessels operating in the gom because vessels had been transferred to international markets and to a four percentage point decrease in total utilization rates on the remaining us based vessels  somewhat offset by an approximate increase in average day rates 
due to a relatively weak gom market  the company transferred vessels to international markets including two deepwater vessels during fiscal the weakening macroeconomic environment in the gom resulted in lower us based vessel utilization during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s deepwater class of vessels were responsible for approximately  or million  of the loss in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal  because two deepwater vessels were transferred to international markets 
the company s active towing supply supply class of vessels  the company s major income producing vessel class in the domestic market  were responsible for approximately  or million  of the loss in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to an

general market conditions demand for the company s vessels in the shallow water gulf of mexico offshore vessel market diminished as repair work on the offshore energy infrastructure that was damaged by hurricane ivan in and hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september  respectively  was completed and numerous drilling rigs migrated to international areas 
the number of available drilling rigs in the gom was very low compared to past industry up cycles because the strength of the international drilling market attracted offshore rigs from the us market 
in reaction to the drilling rigs departing the gulf of mexico during the latter part of calendar year  and because the company s assets are highly mobile  the company relocated a net seven vessels during fiscal to international locations where the vessels contracted for more attractive term work at generally higher day rates than what the vessels achieved in the gom 
the company transferred vessels to international locations during fiscal natural gas prices were relatively weak for most of calendar year as a result of higher than normal inventory levels for the resource 
prices strengthened around mid november  when inventory levels for the resource decreased due to production shut ins  lower liquid natural gas imports and colder than

index to financial statements normal late winter weather  however  the uptick in natural gas prices did not result in higher demand for the company s vessels during the normal winter slowdown period 
crude oil prices soared during calendar year and surpassed the per barrel mark during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal due to strong global consumer demand for crude oil which was driven by emerging economies  dwindling excess opec production capacity  concerns over possible supply interruptions caused by geopolitical risk in certain countries that are members of opec  and production declines in mature oil fields

average day rates on the company s us based deepwater class of vessels decreased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal while utilization rates on this same class of vessel decreased approximately five percentage points during the same comparative periods primarily as a result of an increase in the number of days off hire from drydockings during fiscal average day rates on the u 
s based towing supply supply vessels decreased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal  while utilization rates on the towing supply supply class of vessel decreased approximately nine percentage points during the same comparative periods 
utilization rates on the company s domestic based crew utility class of vessels decreased approximately seven percentage points during fiscal as compared to fiscal while average day rates for the crew utility class of vessels decreased approximately during the same comparative periods 
us based vessel operating profit during fiscal decreased approximately million  or  compared to fiscal due primarily to lower revenues which were slightly mitigated by lower vessel operating costs and by an approximate decrease in depreciation expense resulting from fewer vessels operating in the us gom and the sale of the us based offshore tugs 
us based vessel operating costs decreased approximately  or million  due to fewer vessels operating in the gom and to weaker demand for the company s vessel in the gom market  which resulted in a decrease in crew costs  a decrease in repair and maintenance costs and a decrease in fuel  lube and supplies costs during fiscal as compared to fiscal international based operations international based vessel revenues increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in average day rates on all vessel classes operating in the international markets  and to an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally 
the number of vessels increased internationally because of newly constructed vessels entering the fleet and due to the transfer of vessels from the gom

index to financial statements average day rates for the company s international deepwater class of vessels increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal utilization rates on the same class of vessel decreased approximately three percentage points during the comparative period primarily as a result of the increase in the number of days off hire from vessel drydockings during fiscal average day rates for the company s international towing supply supply class of vessels increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal while utilization rates on the international towing supply supply class of vessels during fiscal fell approximately one percentage point compared to fiscal average day rates on the company s international based crew utility class of vessels increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal while utilization rates for the crew utility class of vessels during fiscal were the same as the rates achieved during fiscal average day rates on the international offshore tugs increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal  while utilization rates for the same class of vessel decreased approximately nine percentage points during the comparative period 
while international based vessel revenues improved during fiscal  revenue growth was slowed by an increased number of maintenance days during fiscal  resulting from a higher level of drydockings performed 
while repair and maintenance expense increased only  capitalized repair and maintenance costs for fully depreciated vessels that extended their useful lives increased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal  or an increase of approximately 
the increased number of maintenance days negatively impacted the utilization statistics of the company s vessels during fiscal international based vessel operating profit increased approximately or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher revenues 
higher international based revenues earned during fiscal were partially offset by a increase in vessel operating costs primarily crew costs  repair and maintenance costs  insurance and loss reserves  fuel  lube and supplies and other vessel costs and increase in depreciation expense during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  resulting from an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally  including newly constructed vessels added to the international based fleet over the past year 
crew costs increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to basic inflationary increases in labor costs around the world and due to an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally  including newly constructed vessels 
repair and maintenance costs increased approximately due to an increase in the average cost per drydock performed during fiscal and to higher routine repair and maintenance costs 
other vessel costs increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher brokers commission expense 
other items gain on sales of assets during fiscal decreased approximately  or million  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the large gain recorded from the sale of offshore tugs during fiscal the transaction resulted in an approximate million pre tax financial gain  or approximately million after tax  or per diluted common share after tax 
dispositions of vessels can vary from quarter to quarter  therefore  gains on sales of assets may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
insurance costs increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to lower premiums and loss reserves recorded in fiscal  which resulted from a better safety record during fiscal as compared to the company s safety performance in fiscal vessel class revenue and statistics by segment vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created largely through the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided also influence vessel day rates 
vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel is available to work in the reporting period 
average day rates are calculated by dividing the revenue a vessel earns during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel worked in the reporting period 
vessel utilization and average day rates are calculated only on vessels in service and  as such  do not include vessels withdrawn from service or joint venture vessels

venezuelan operations 
over the past several months  the company has been confronted with several serious challenges with respect to its operations in venezuela 
the first challenge relates to a build up in the net receivable due the company from petroleos de venezuela  sa  including certain of its subsidiaries collectively  pdvsa 
pdvsa is the national oil company of venezuela and the company s principal customer in that market 
the second challenge has been more recently presented by virtue of efforts of the venezuelan government to move forward with the nationalization of the assets of oil service companies operating in the lake maracaibo region of venezuela 
a discussion of both of these challenges follows 

table of contents 
index to financial statements on may   venezuela enacted a law allowing for the expropriation of oil service companies that support certain oil and gas exploration activities in venezuela 
on may   the venezuelan ministry of energy and petroleum issued a resolution acting pursuant to the new law listing the company s venezuelan subsidiary as an entity to be affected by the expropriation 
on that same date  pdvsa took possession of of the company s vessels that were supporting pdvsa operations in the lake maracaibo region of venezuela and had been bareboat chartered by the company s venezuelan operating subsidiary from other tidewater companies 
pdvsa also took possession of the company s shore based facility adjacent to lake maracaibo 
all of the vessels are now being operated exclusively by pdvsa 
in addition  pdvsa is supplying all shore based operational support to these vessels 
pdvsa has occupied the venezuelan subsidiary s base adjacent to lake maracaibo but has not to date denied access to subsidiary personnel 
the new law requires the venezuelan government to compensate the company for the assets that it expropriates by paying an amount equal to the book value of the assets less certain liabilities owed by the subsidiary to current and former employees and less an amount for any environmental liabilities from prior operations 
no offer has been submitted by pdvsa to date 
the company intends to engage pdvsa to discuss compensation and the resolution of the outstanding receivables for services provided to pdvsa that is discussed below 
although the net book value at march   of the vessels seized and the company s shore based facility adjacent to lake maracaibo is approximately million  the company s estimate of the current fair market value of these assets and the related business as a going concern substantially exceeds this amount 
the company s venezuelan operating subsidiary operates six additional company owned vessels outside the lake maracaibo area that have not been affected by the expropriation law 
while only the base and vessels have been seized to date  venezuelan authorities may  under the provisions of the may  expropriation law  seek to take possession of these other company assets or of the venezuelan subsidiary itself 
at march   the company had a net receivable from pdvsa of approximately million approximately million at december  
cash receipts from pdvsa from january  through march  totaled million  of which approximately were paid in bolivars  as permitted by the terms of the underlying charter agreements 
the march  net book value of vessels operating in venezuela  including the vessels operating on lake maracaibo  totaled approximately million  with million relating to vessels supporting pdvsa 
the company s estimate of the current fair market value of these assets and of the seized business as a going concern substantially exceeds this amount 
at april   the company s venezuelan based vessels totaled vessels supporting pdvsa  including the vessels operating on lake maracaibo  and two vessels supporting an offshore operation of another client 
the company s contracts with pdvsa require payments in both bolivars paid in venezuela and us dollars paid in the us based on a split agreed to between pdvsa and the company 
the million receivable balance at march  is comprised of approximately million of bolivars and million of us dollars 
payment in bolivars from pdvsa of either bolivar based receivables or us dollar based receivables could result in our accumulating a surplus of bolivars which would increase our exposure to devaluation risk 
venezuela continues to operate under the exchange controls put in place in with the official venezuelan bolivars exchange rate fixed at bolivars to one us dollar 
the exact amount and timing of any future devaluation is uncertain 
the company had contracts with pdvsa for eleven vessels in the lake maracaibo region that  prior to the may   law enactment which the company believes cancels the contracts  would have run through may the company is also operating under a six month contract with pdvsa for four other vessels working off the eastern coast of venezuela through june the company frequently communicates with pdvsa regarding the settlement of the outstanding receivables  as well as extensions of existing contracts 
while the collection of the receivables is difficult and time consuming due to pdvsa policies and procedures  the company continues to work toward full collection of the amount due

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the recorded values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting period 
the company s estimates and assumptions affect its recognition of deferred expenses  bad debts  income taxes  the carrying value of its long lived assets and goodwill  and its provision for certain contingencies 
the company evaluates the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions continually based on a combination of historical information and other information that comes to its attention that may vary its outlook for the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
management suggests that the company s summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition 
the company s primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis 
these time charter contracts are generally either on a term basis average three months to two years or on a spot basis 
the base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate  provided  however  that term contracts at times include escalation clauses to recover increases in specific costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to three months 
marine vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
there are no material differences in the costs structure of the company s contracts based on whether the contracts are spot or term for the operating costs are generally the same without regard to the length of a contract 
receivables 
in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  development and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements production companies 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes what it believes to be adequate provisions for doubtful accounts 
goodwill 
the company tests goodwill impairment annually at a reporting unit level  as required  utilizing carrying amounts as of december the company considers its reporting units to be its domestic and international operations 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s estimated weighted average cost of capital 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the respective book value of the reporting unit goodwill  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  such as  future expected utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december   and the test determined there was no goodwill impairment 
at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
interim testing will be performed if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include significant adverse industry or economic changes  significant business interruption due to political unrest or terrorism  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group are compared with the carrying amount of the asset group to determine if a write down may be required 
the company estimates cash flows based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of future market performance that is based on industry trends 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value 
vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics are grouped for asset impairment testing 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce materially different results 
management estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions or poor operating results that could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of an asset group  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as the company s fleet continues to age  management closely monitors the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis to properly identify evolving trends and changes in market conditions that could impact the results of the impairment evaluation 
in addition to the periodic review of long lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant  the company also performs a review of its stacked vessels and vessels withdrawn from service every six months 
this review considers items such as the vessel s age  length of time stacked and likelihood and cost of a return to active service 
the company records an impairment charge when the carrying value of a vessel withdrawn from service or stacked vessel that is unlikely to return to service exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company recorded million impairment during fiscal  which was included in gains on sales of assets 
no impairment was recorded in fiscal or income taxes 
the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which it operates internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets is based on the company s present belief that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record or adjust valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for changes to valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the present need for a valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
drydocking costs 
the company expenses maintenance and repair costs as incurred during the asset s original estimated useful life its original depreciable life 
major repair costs incurred after the original depreciable life that also has the effect of extending the useful life of the asset are capitalized and amortized over months 
major vessel modifications are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the equipment 
vessel modifications that are performed for a specific customer contract are capitalized and amortized over the firm contract term 
the majority of the company s vessels require a drydocking inspection twice in each five year period  and the company schedules these drydockings when it is anticipated that the work can be performed 
the company s net earnings can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of scheduled drydockings 
accrued property and liability losses 
the company self insures a portion of potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
the company is exposed to insurance risks related to the company s reinsurance contracts with various insurance entities 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount it expects to receive and also estimates losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported or not fully developed 
the company also monitors its reinsurance recoverable balances regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and makes adequate provisions for doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan covering eligible employees of tidewater inc and participating subsidiaries 
the company also sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan that covers eligible us fleet personnel and eligible employees of the company hired after december  and a post retirement plan for qualified retired employees 
net periodic pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations are determined using a number of assumptions including the discount rate  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and expected long term return on plan assets 
these assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
the company s pension cost consists of service costs  interest costs  amortization of prior service costs or benefits  expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the company considers a number of factors in developing its pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
the company also provides postretirement benefits to qualified retired employees 
the postretirement program provides limited health care and life insurance benefits 
costs of the program are based on actuarially determined amounts and are accrued over the period from the date of hire to the full eligibility date of employees who are expected to qualify for these benefits 
this plan is not funded

effects of inflation day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
however  because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the company s operating costs 
the major impact on operating costs is the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy exploration and production companies 
as spending increases  prices of goods and services used by the energy industry and the energy services industry will increase 
future increases in vessel day rates may shield the company from the inflationary effects on operating costs 
due to an increase in business activity resulting from strong global oil and gas fundamentals experienced in the past few years  the competitive market for experienced crew personnel has exerted upward pressure on wages  which has increased the company s operating expenses 
the company s newer technically sophisticated anchor handling towing supply vessels and platform supply vessels generally require a greater number of specially train fleet personnel than the company s older smaller vessels 
competition for skilled crew may intensify  particularly in international markets  as new build vessels currently under construction enter the global fleet 
if competition for personnel intensifies  the company s crew costs will likely increase 
strong fundamentals in the global energy industry experienced in the past few years have also increased the activity levels at shipyards worldwide  which led to increased pricing for both repair work and new construction work at shipyards 
also  the price of steel increased dramatically due to increased worldwide demand for the metal 
the price of steel is high by historical standards 
although prices moderated some since calendar year  availability of iron ore  the main component of steel  is tighter today than in when prices for iron ore increased dramatically 
if the price of steel continues to rise  the cost of new vessels will result in higher capital expenditures and depreciation expenses which will reduce the company s future operating profits  unless day rates increase commensurately 
however  the financial crisis and resulting global recession have dramatically reduced global demand for all commodities  including steel  which resulted in lower commodity prices 
steel market participants have already announced that they will reduce steel output during calendar year  which  in turn  could stabilize the price of steel  although that will depend upon many factors that will ultimately relate to worldwide demand for the product 
environmental compliance during the ordinary course of business  the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations 
compliance with existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
further  the company is involved in various legal proceedings that relate to asbestos and other environmental matters 
in the opinion of management  based on current information  the amount of ultimate liability  if any  with respect to these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company is proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any hazardous materials aboard its vessels and at shore base locations 
whenever possible  hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas in an attempt to ensure containment if accidents occur 
in addition  the company has established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment

interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  interest income and interest expense 
the company s financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk are its cash equivalents and long term borrowings 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of the cash equivalent investment portfolio  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investments 
the book value for cash equivalents is considered to be representative of its fair value 
at march   the company had outstanding million of senior unsecured notes that were issued on july  the multiple series of notes were originally issued with maturities ranging from seven years to years and had an average remaining life of years as of march  these notes can be retired prior to maturity without penalty 
the weighted average interest rate on the notes is 
the fair value of this debt at march  was estimated to be million

commitment fees on the unused portion of this facility are in the range of to based on the company s funded debt to total capitalization ratio 
the company s revolving credit facility matures in may the company had no outstanding interest rate swaps at march  and foreign exchange risk 
the company s financial instruments that can be affected by foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risks consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company periodically enters into spot and forward derivative financial instruments as a hedge against foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and currency commitments 
spot derivative financial instruments are short term in nature and settle within two business days 
the fair value approximates the carrying value due to the short term nature of this instrument  and as a result  no gains or losses are recognized 
forward derivative financial instruments are generally longer term in nature but generally do not exceed one year 
the accounting for gains or losses on forward contracts is dependent on the nature of the risk being hedged and the effectiveness of the hedge 
the company had no spot contracts outstanding at march  and the company had no forward contracts outstanding at march  at march  the company had one singapore dollar and six euro forward contracts outstanding 
the singapore dollar forward contract hedged the company s foreign exchange exposure related to the final payment of a capital lease obligation  which totaled million 
the company was required  per the lease obligation  to make its remaining commitment  which totaled a us dollar equivalent of approximately million  in singapore dollars 
the six outstanding euro forward  which totaled million  hedged the company s foreign exchange exposure related to the construction of two crewboats 
the construction commitment totaled a us dollar equivalent of approximately million 
the combined change in fair value of these seven forward contracts was approximately million at march   and was recorded as an increase to earnings during fiscal because the forward contracts did not qualify as hedge instruments 
at march   the company had four forward contracts outstanding

the combined change in fair value of the four forward contracts was approximately million at march   which was recorded as an increase to earnings during fiscal because the forward contracts did not qualify as hedge instruments 
due to the company s international operations  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risks on all charter hire contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the company generally does not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business 
to minimize the financial impact of these items the company attempts to contract a significant majority of its services in united states dollars 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in us dollars 
in addition  where possible  the company attempts to minimize its financial impact of these risks  by matching the currency of the company s operating costs with the currency of the revenue streams
