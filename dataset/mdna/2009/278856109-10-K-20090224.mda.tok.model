executive overview about the company eclipsys is a leading provider of advanced integrated clinical  revenue cycle and performance management software  and professional services that help healthcare organizations improve clinical  financial  and operational outcomes 
we develop and license proprietary software and content that is designed for use in connection with many of the key clinical  financial and operational functions that healthcare organizations require 
among other things  our software enables physicians  nurses and other clinicians to coordinate care through shared electronic medical records  place orders and access and share information about patients  helps our clients optimize the healthcare revenue cycle  including patient admissions  scheduling  invoicing  inventory control and cost accounting  supports clinical and financial planning and analysis  and provides information for use by physicians  nurses and other clinicians through clinical content  which is integrated with our software 
we also provide professional services related to our software 
these services include software implementation and maintenance  outsourcing  remote hosting of our software  as well as third party healthcare information technology applications  technical and user training and consulting 
with the exception of hardware revenues  we classify our revenues in one caption systems and services in our statement of operations since the amount of license revenue related to traditional software contracts is less than of total revenues and the remaining revenue types included in this caption relate to bundled subscription arrangements and other services arrangements that have similar attribution patterns for revenue recognition 
our income statement items of revenue are as follows systems and services revenues include revenues derived from a variety of sources  including software licenses and contractual software maintenance  and professional services  which include implementation  training and consulting services 
our systems and services revenues include both subscription software license revenues and software maintenance revenues which are like recognized ratably over the contractual term and license revenues related to traditional software contracts which are generally recognized upon delivery of the software and represents less than of total revenues 
for some clients  we host the software applications licensed from us remotely on our own servers  which saves such clients the cost of procuring and maintaining hardware and related facilities 
for other clients  we offer an outsourced solution in which we assume partial to total responsibility for a healthcare organization s information technology operations using our employees 
margins on the license and maintenance revenue are generally significantly higher than those on the professional services revenues 
hardware revenues result from our sale of computer hardware to our clients in connection with their implementation of our software 
we purchase this hardware from suppliers and resell it to our clients 
as clients elect more remote hosted solutions  clients need for hardware is reduced and future hardware revenues may be negatively impacted 
the amount of hardware revenues  and the proportion of our total revenues that they represent  can vary significantly from period to period 
margins on hardware revenues are generally significantly lower than those on systems and services revenues 
we market our software to healthcare providers of many different sizes and specialties  including community hospitals  large multi entity healthcare systems  academic medical centers  outpatient clinics and physician practices 
most of the top ranked us hospitals named in us news world report s honor roll use one or more of our solutions 

table of contents we continue to focus on expanding our international business  including our operations in india and sales of our solutions outside of north america  such as the asia pacific region and the middle east 
as of december  our india operations have expanded to include two offices and approximately employees 
we believe that india provides access to educated professionals to work on software research  development and support  as well as other functions  at an economically effective cost  and also represents a potential new market for our software 
in  eclipsys acquired enterprise performance systems  inc epsi  medinotes corporation medinotes  and premise corporation premise 
each of these companies added strategic new products that are expected to help improve our competitive position and also drive additional revenue growth 
in february  we acquired epsi  a provider of business performance improvement solutions that help healthcare executives better manage the business of healthcare by providing actionable financial management and decision support data from all functional areas  which include budgeting planning  cost accounting  patient and financial clinical analysis 
in october  we acquired medinotes  an industry leader in physician practice information solutions 
this addition helps us more effectively support healthcare enterprises community strategies  to better coordinate care between clinicians and patients  and puts us in one of the fastest growing markets in healthcare  practice management and electronic medical records 
in december  we acquired premise  expanding our portfolio of solutions that help our clients improve operational performance  which also includes epsi software and our growing portfolio of analytics solutions 
this acquisition expands our range of solutions to help our clients improve operational performance 
premise s software solutions and services for bed management  bed turnover  and transport help optimize patient flow  streamline communications  and enhance operational efficiency 
business environment our industry  healthcare information technology  is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations and industry standards 
sales of eclipsys solutions can be affected significantly by many competitive factors  including the features and cost of our solutions as compared to the offerings of our competitors  our marketing effectiveness  and the success of our research and development of new and enhanced solutions 
we anticipate that the healthcare information technology industry will continue to grow and be seen as a way to curb growing healthcare costs while also improving the quality of healthcare 
new accounting pronouncements see note b to our consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies we believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to the understanding of our historical and future performance as these policies affect the reported amount of revenues and expenses and other significant areas and involve management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates and adjusts its estimates and judgments  if necessary 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be materially different from those estimates 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software development costs  stock based compensation and income taxes 
please refer to note b of the audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenues are derived from licensing of computer software  software and hardware maintenance  professional services including implementation  integration  training and consulting  remote hosting  outsourcing  network services  and the sale of computer hardware 

table of contents we generally contract under multiple element arrangements  which include software license fees  hardware and services  including implementation  integration  training and software maintenance  for periods of to years 
we evaluate revenue recognition on a contract by contract basis as the terms of each arrangement vary 
the evaluation of our contractual arrangements often requires judgments and estimates that affect the timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations 
specifically  we may be required to make judgments about whether the fees associated with our software and services are fixed or determinable  whether collection of our fees is considered probable  whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the related software  whether we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  and whether we have verifiable objective evidence of fair value for our software and services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sop and sab  as amended  require among other matters  that there be a signed contract evidencing an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and remaining obligations under the agreement are insignificant 
many of our contracts with our clients are multiple element arrangements that provide for multiple software modules including the rights to unspecified future versions and releases we may offer within the software suites the client purchases or rights to unspecified software versions that support different hardware or operating platforms  and that do not qualify as exchange rights 
we refer to these arrangements as subscription contracts 
additionally  we sometimes enter into multiple element arrangements that do not include these rights to unspecified future software or platform protection rights 
we refer to these arrangements as traditional software contracts 
finally  we offer much of our software and services on a stand alone basis 
revenue under each of these arrangements is recognized as set forth below subscription contracts our subscription contracts typically include the following elements software license  maintenance  professional services  and third party hardware or remote hosting services 
software license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  commencing upon the delivery of the software provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of our fee is considered probable 
the value of the software is determined using the residual method pursuant to sop modification of sop  with respect to certain transactions 
these contracts contain the rights to unspecified future software within the suite purchased and or unspecified platform transfer rights that do not qualify for exchange accounting 
accordingly  these arrangements are accounted for pursuant to paragraphs and of sop software revenue recognition 
under certain arrangements  we capitalize related direct costs consisting of third party software costs and direct software implementation costs 
these costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement 
in the case of maintenance revenues  vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value is based on substantive renewal prices  and the revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
in the case of professional services revenues  vsoe is based on prices from stand alone sale transactions  and the revenues are recognized as services are performed pursuant to paragraph of sop third party hardware revenues are recognized upon delivery  pursuant to sab 
table of contents for remote hosting services  vsoe is based upon consistent pricing charged to clients based on volumes and performance requirements on a stand alone basis and substantive renewal terms  and the revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term as the services are performed 
our remote hosting arrangements generally require us to perform one time set up activities and include a one time set up fee 
this one time set up fee is generally paid by the client at contract execution 
we have determined that these set up activities do not constitute a separate unit of accounting  and accordingly the related set up fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
we consider the applicability of eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  to our remote hosting services arrangements on a contract by contract basis 
if we determine that the client has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty  and can feasibly run the software on its own hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software  a software element covered by sop exists 
when a software element exists in a remote hosting services arrangement  we recognize the license  professional services and remote hosting services revenues pursuant to sop  whereby the fair value of the remote hosting service is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the remote hosting contract 
if we determine that a software element covered by sop is not present in a remote hosting services arrangement  we recognize revenue for the remote hosting services arrangement  ratably over the term of the remote hosting contract pursuant to sab traditional software contracts we enter into traditional multiple element arrangements that can include the following elements software license  maintenance  professional services  and third party hardware or remote hosting services 
revenue for each of the elements is recognized as follows software license fees are recognized upon delivery of the software provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of our fee is considered probable 
for those arrangements in which the fee is not considered fixed or determinable  the software license revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
for arrangements where vsoe only exists for the undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements software license revenue using the residual method in accordance with sop in addition to the software license fees  these contracts may also contain maintenance  professional services and hardware or remote hosting services 
vsoe and revenue recognition for these elements is determined using the same methodology as noted above for subscription contracts 
software contracts requiring contract accounting we enter into certain multiple element arrangements containing milestone provisions in which the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
under these arrangements  software license fees and professional service revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method over the implementation period which generally ranges from to months 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the implementation based upon estimates of total labor hours incurred and revenues to be generated over the term of the implementation 
changes in estimates of total labor hours and the related effect on the timing of revenues and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
accordingly  changes in these estimates could occur and have a material effect on our operating results in the period of change 
stand alone software and service we also market certain software and services on a stand alone basis  including the following software license  
table of contents maintenance  professional services  hardware  outsourcing  and remote hosting services 
revenues related to such software and services are recognized as follows software license fees and maintenance marketed on a stand alone basis may be licensed either under traditional contracts or under subscription arrangements 
software license fees under traditional contracts are recognized pursuant to sop upon delivery of the software  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
under subscription agreements for stand alone software  license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
with respect to maintenance  vsoe is determined based on substantive renewal prices contained in the contracts 
maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
professional services represent incremental services marketed to clients including implementation  consulting  and training services 
professional services revenues  where vsoe is based on prices from stand alone transactions  are recognized as services are performed 
hardware is recognized upon delivery pursuant to sab network service arrangements include the assessment  assembly and delivery of a wireless network which may include wireless carts or other wireless equipment to the client 
our network services arrangements are sold to a client for a fixed fee 
all services are performed prior to the delivery of the equipment 
these contracts are typically to days in length and are recognized pursuant to sab  upon the delivery of the network to the client 
we exited the network services business in remote hosting contracts that are sold on a stand alone basis are recognized ratably over the contract term pursuant to sab our remote hosting arrangements generally require us to perform one time set up activities and include a one time set up fee 
this one time set up fee is generally paid by the client at contract execution 
we have determined that these set up activities do not constitute a separate unit of accounting  and accordingly  recognize the related set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
we provide outsourcing services to our clients 
under these arrangements we assume full  partial or transitional responsibilities for a healthcare organization s it operations using our employees 
our outsourcing services include facilities management  network outsourcing and transition management 
these arrangements typically range from five to ten years in duration 
revenues from these arrangements are recognized when services are performed 
we record reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both systems and services revenues and as a direct cost of systems and services in accordance with eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
for   and reimbursable out of pocket expenses were million  million  and million  respectively 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees  we have classified the reimbursement by clients of shipping and handling costs as revenue and the associated cost as cost of revenue 
if other judgments or assumptions were used in the evaluation of our revenue arrangements  the timing and amounts of revenue recognized may have been significantly different 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific client s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  as well as general factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record a reserve for specific account balances as well as a reserve based on our historical experience for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from clients 
if circumstances related to specific clients change  or economic conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents capitalized software development costs we capitalize a portion of our computer software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
these costs include salaries  benefits  consulting and other directly related costs incurred in connection with programming and testing software 
capitalization ceases when the software is generally released for sale to clients 
management monitors the net realizable value of development costs to ensure that the investment will be recovered through future revenues 
capitalized software development costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these costs are amortized over the greater of i the ratio of current revenues to total and anticipated future revenues for the applicable software or ii the straight line method over three years 
during   all of our capitalized software costs were amortized over a three year period 
amortization of capitalized software development costs  which is included in cost of systems and services  was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accumulated amortization of capitalized software development costs was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment  as adopted effective january  we elected to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized during the year ended december   includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas amortized over the awards vesting period  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r amortized on a straight line basis over the awards vesting period 
the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for the activity under our stock plans 
option pricing model input assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility  and risk free interest rate  impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions were based on or determined from external data for example  the risk free interest rate and other assumptions were derived from our historical experience for example volatility 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
we have elected to use the simplified method for estimating our expected term equal to the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term as allowed by sab  share based payment 
staff accounting bulletin  year end help for expensing employee stock options  for options granted after december  requires the use of historical data to estimate an expected term unless the company significantly changes the terms of its share option grants 
the grants the company issued after december  have a contractual term of years  which differs from the contractual term of the historical grants generally years 
therefore  we do not have sufficient historical data to estimate the expected term for current option issuances 
accordingly  we continue to use the simplified method 
additionally  this reduction in contractual term has lowered our assumption of our expected term 
we currently estimate volatility by using the weighted average historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term input to the black scholes model 
we estimate forfeitures using a weighted average historical forfeiture rate 
our estimate of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from our estimate 

table of contents income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
a change in these estimates could have a material effect on our operating results 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheet 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas requires the company to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
it further states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
since inception  the company has maintained a valuation allowance equal to the deferred us tax assets after considering the us deferred tax assets that can be realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences 
based upon the company s results of operations in recent years  and its expected profitability in this and future years  the company has concluded  effective september   that it is more likely than not that substantially all of its net us deferred tax assets will be realized 
as a result  in accordance with sfas  substantially all of the valuation allowance applied to such net deferred tax assets was reversed in reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in a non cash income tax benefit in totaling million 
as of december   a valuation allowance of approximately million has been established against the us state and canada deferred tax assets that management does not believe are more likely than not to be realized 
this determination is based primarily on the company s projected expiration of net operating losses in various state jurisdictions 
we will continue to assess the requirement for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in the third quarter of  the company completed its analysis of research and development expenditures for eligibility to qualify for a research and development r d tax credit 
accordingly  the company recorded a deferred tax asset and related tax benefit of million 
as of december   the company has total r d tax credit carryforwards of million 
in  million of the r d credits begin to expire 
in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in canada would be recovered from future taxable income 
accordingly  in  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million for the reversal of the tax valuation allowance related to our canadian operation 
as of december   we had us net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
of this amount  million expires in and million expires in  the balance expires in varying amounts through of the total us net operating loss carry forward  approximately million relates to stock option tax deductions which will be tax effected and the benefit credited as additional paid in capital when realized 
additionally  the company has canadian net operating loss carryovers of approximately million that expire in varying amounts through our indian subsidiary is entitled to a tax holiday which expires in 
table of contents goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  classifies intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite lives  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
our acquired technology and other intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable  we review such intangible assets with definite lives for impairment 
such conditions may include an economic downturn in a market or a change in the assessment of future operations 
goodwill is not amortized 
we perform tests for impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
we have only one reporting unit for which all goodwill is assigned 
impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the company compared to the comparable carrying value  including goodwill

the acquisition of medinotes in october accounted for million of the increase 
although revenues increased in  we experienced a decrease in the growth rate in the fourth quarter of  as revenues for the three months ended december  grew only compared to the three months ended december  systems and services revenues systems and services revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the overall increase for the year ended december  resulted from increases of million in revenues recognized on a ratable basis and million in professional services revenues offset by a decrease of million in periodic revenues 

table of contents revenues recognized ratably revenues recognized ratably from software  maintenance  outsourcing and remote hosting were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  as compared to year ended december  the increase was due to new sales bookings in previous periods for our solutions  remote hosting related services  and outsourcing  resulting in growth in our recurring revenue base 
future growth in these revenues depends upon future bookings in excess of previous levels 
in addition  the acquisition of epsi in february added million to our revenues recognized ratably for the year ended december  these increases were offset by a decrease of million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   as a result of the sale of our clinical practice model resource center cpmrc business in late periodic revenues periodic revenues for software related fees  third party software related fees and networking services only were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the table below summarizes the components of periodic revenues in thousands for the years ended december  change change eclipsys software related fees third party software related fees networking services total periodic revenues in any period  some software revenues can be considered one time in nature for that period  and we do not recognize these revenues on a ratable basis 
these revenues include traditional license fees associated with new contracts signed in the period  including add on licenses to existing clients and new client transactions  as well as revenues from contract backlog that had not previously been recognized pending contract performance that occurred or was completed during the period  and certain other activities during the period associated with client relationships 
in the aggregate  these periodic revenues can contribute significantly to earnings in the period because relatively little in period costs are associated with such revenues other than those costs associated with networking services  which is applicable only to 
we expect these periodic revenues to continue to fluctuate as a result of significant variations in the type and magnitude of sales and other contract and client activity in any period  and these variations make it difficult to predict the nature and amount of these periodic revenues 
the acquisition of epsi in february contributed periodic software related fees revenues of million for the year ended december  in addition  the acquisition of medinotes in october contributed periodic software related fees revenues of million for the year ended december  our periodic revenues may vary significantly  and fall below prior period levels  if challenging economic conditions continue to motivate clients to defer capital investments  conserve cash and prefer software subscription contracting to traditional licensing arrangements 
periodic revenue from traditional software license arrangements carries high margins and contributes significantly to overall profitability in the transaction period  and increasing periodic software license revenue beyond levels is important to our ability to improve profitability 
we believe economic conditions  and resulting cash conservation by clients  adversely affected our periodic software related fees revenues in the second half of  and continuation of these conditions and client reactions will adversely affect our results of operations in during  we exited our networking services business and shifted any residual client network hardware needs to third party hardware providers 
the related revenues are included in hardware revenues for the year ended december  professional services revenues professional services revenues  which include implementation  training and consulting related services  were million for the year ended december   an increase of 
table of contents million  or  as compared to the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from higher utilization of our professional services team and increased activity associated with implementation of our software following increases in previous period software sales 
in addition  the acquisition of epsi in february and the acquisition of medinotes in october added million and million respectively to our professional services revenues in these increases were offset by a decrease of million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   as a result of the sale of our clinical practice model resource center cpmrc business in late utilization of our professional services organization fell short of our expectations in the fourth quarter of  and in response we are reducing professional services headcount 
demand for professional services in is uncertain 
hardware revenues hardware revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  during  we exited our networking services business and shifted any residual client network hardware needs to third party hardware providers resulting in a shift from periodic revenues to hardware revenues 
this shift contributed hardware revenues of million for the year ended december  operating expenses stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is included in cost of systems and services  sales and marketing  general and administrative  and research and development expenses 
total stock based compensation was million for the year ended december   up million compared to the year ended december  stock based compensation expense increased in as compared to due to the timing of options issued the majority of the stock option grants occurred in the first half of while the majority of the grants occurred in the second half of  an increase in restricted stock grants  and a decrease in the vesting period for stock awards granted in as compared to the increase in stock compensation expense also reflected a change of the forfeiture rate application used in the calculation of stock based compensation expense 
beginning with the third quarter of  we elected to change the application of the forfeiture rate used in the calculation of stock based compensation expense which resulted in a non recurring incremental expense of million 
stock based compensation expense in future periods depends upon equity award activity and changes in variables affecting the valuations of equity awards  as well as the timing of full vesting of awards and resulting cessation of associated expense 
cost of systems and services our cost of systems and services increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase reflects labor related costs increased by million  which includes higher wages and benefits of million  higher stock based compensation of million  higher severance expenses of million  partially offset by lower annual incentive compensation expense of million 
the increase in wages reflects higher average headcount supporting growth in the business 
growth slowed in our services business leading to headcount reductions in early higher stock based compensation was primarily due to factors discussed in the previous paragraph 
our reorganization of the services organization in the third quarter drove the increase in severance expense 
the reduction in annual incentive compensation expense resulted from failure to meet minimum operating results required to fund payment of incentive compensation under our corporate bonus plan 
third party software cost of services increased by million included growth in our third party business and amounts recognized in the third quarter related to nonrecurring adjustments from prior periods and more contract activity requiring third party services as a result of exiting our network business 
amortization of capitalized software increased by million as a result of the release of sunrisexa in december of these increases were slightly offset by lower consulting and insurance fees in 
table of contents cost of hardware cost of hardware increased million or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  impacted by higher hardware sales and an incremental adjustment in the third quarter of of million to correctly record certain third party embedded software costs which were previously deferred 
increases in costs of hardware were also impacted by our networking services business during  which shifted any residual network hardware activity to third party hardware providers 
this shift created additional hardware costs related to increased third party hardware activity 
the first nine months of were also impacted by higher software costs for reasons previously discussed for the third quarter of sales and marketing our sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december the increase in sales and marketing expenses included higher labor related compensation and higher travel  sales trade shows  and other miscellaneous expenses in efforts to continue to grow the business 
higher labor related costs included higher stock based compensation of million  higher basic wages and related benefits of million  partially offset by lower annual incentive compensation expense of million resulting from failure to meet minimum operating results required to fund payment of incentive compensation under our corporate bonus plan and lower sales commissions of million 
research and development our research and development expenses increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   labor related costs increased million impacted by higher wages and related benefits due to higher headcount in india  partially offset by a decrease in annual incentive compensation expense resulting from failure to meet minimum operating results required to fund payment of incentive compensation under our corporate bonus plan 
the increase in research and development expenses also reflect a million year over year decrease in internal labor cost capitalization due to completion of development work related to sunrisexa  which we released in december of our gross research and development spending  which consists of research and development expenses and capitalized software development costs of million in  increased million compared to million in this increase was due primarily to continued expansion of our research and development activities in supporting current and future growth in our business 
in summary  research and development expense for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands for the year ended december  change change research and development expenses capitalized software and development costs gross research and development expenditures amortization of capitalized software development costs general and administrative our general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  increases in general and administrative costs include higher bad debt expense of million due to write offs and reserves for specific receivables in labor costs for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  increased million due to higher stock based compensation expense of million and higher labor and benefit costs of million  partially offset by lower annual incentive compensation expense of million resulting from failure to meet minimum operating results required to fund payment of incentive compensation under our corporate bonus plan 
other increases in 
table of contents general and administrative costs include higher rents and facilities costs due to office transition and build outs in india and atlanta 
these increases were partially offset by lower legal costs of million in due to completion of the voluntary stock option review in and to a lesser extent insurance recoveries associated with our derivative lawsuit recorded as a reduction in legal expense in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization is attributable primarily to million of increased amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions of epsi and medinotes 
due to the timing of these acquisitions and our acquisition of premise on december   we expect amortization to increase approximately million in in process research and development charge approximately million of the purchase price of our acquisition of epsi was allocated to in process research and development and was charged to our income statement in the first quarter of the million acquired in process research and development was valued using the multi period excess earnings method by an independent appraisal firm 
the material assumptions  underlying the purchase price allocation  were as follows projected revenue assumptions  decay rate  cost assumptions  operating expense assumptions  charge assumptions for the use of contributory assets  and discount rate assumptions 
at the date of acquisition  the technology was still in the research and development phase and had not yet been completed to a point of an existing or current product offering 
at the time of acquisition  the projected cost to complete the project was million 
the in process technology was incorporated within an epsi product module that was released in january restructuring charges restructuring charges were million in the restructuring expenses related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters from boca raton  florida to atlanta  georgia 
gain on sale of assets during we recorded additional gain on sale of assets of million  resulting from the completion of post closing milestones associated with the fourth quarter sale of our cpmrc business 
in december of we recorded a million gain on the original sale of the cpmrc business 
see compared to results for additional disclosure on the sale of this business 
loss on auction rate security ars we recorded a net loss of million during this net loss included a gain of million associated with recording the fair value of a settlement agreement entered into with ubs in november  which was more than offset by a million loss reflecting the reduction of the fair value of our ars purchased through ubs 
interest expense we incurred interest expense of million on borrowings under the million short term financing arrangement we entered into in february and repaid in may  the million short term financing arrangement we entered into in may and repaid in august  and the million borrowed under the million long term financing arrangement we entered into in august the interest rate applicable to the borrowed amount is based  at our option  on the prime rate  one month libor rate  three month libor rate  six month libor rate or month libor rate at the initial debt draw date and interest rate contract end date plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is based on our leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement and as of december  was 
our leverage ratio increases to in due to the increase in our outstanding debt 
the effective interest rates at december  are as follows outstanding debt interest rate borrowings increased from to million in stages during  including borrowings of approximately million in october and approximately million in december 
borrowings are not expected to decrease in 
table of contents interest income interest income decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to year ended december  the decrease was attributable to lower interest rates in as compared to on our ars due to failed dutch auctions beginning in february although the auctions failed  we continued to earn interest on the ars  but only at the contractual rate 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the change in income taxes was primarily related to the benefit of the release of our us deferred tax asset valuation allowance and recognizing the benefit of research and development credits 
beginning with the first quarter of  we expect to begin providing for an income tax provision at a rate on income before taxes equal to our combined worldwide effective tax rate 
however  our tax rate could be unfavorably impacted by share based compensation shortfalls 
a shortfall exists for a stock compensation award to the extent that the cumulative recognized book stock compensation expense for that award exceeds the associated tax deduction 
substantial amounts of stock compensation shortfalls could occur in because of the recent volatility of the company s common stock price 
however  we are not able to predict the amount of the shortfalls 
the company must reflect a tax provision for stock compensation shortfalls because it has no pool of windfall tax benefits from stock compensation 
the company has no pool of windfall tax benefit because the company has used the with and without or incremental approach for ordering tax benefits derived from the share based payment of awards 
compared to revenues total revenues increased by million  or to million  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  systems and services revenues systems and services revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  of this increase  million was attributable to revenue recognized on a ratable basis  million was attributable to revenue from professional services and million was attributable to periodic revenues related to software licenses and other in period related activities 
revenues recognized ratably revenues recognized ratably from software  maintenance  outsourcing and remote hosting were million  for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  as compared to year ended december  the increase was due to new sales bookings in previous periods for our solutions  remote hosting related services  and outsourcing  in previous periods  resulting in growth in our recurring revenue base 
future growth in these revenues depends upon future bookings in excess of previous levels 

table of contents periodic revenues periodic revenues for software related fees  third party software related fees and networking services were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or over the prior year 
the table below summarizes the components of periodic revenues in thousands for the years ended december  change change eclipsys software related fees third party software related fees networking services total periodic revenues in any period  some software revenues can be considered one time in nature for that period  and we do not recognize these revenues on a ratable basis 
these revenues include traditional license fees associated with new contracts signed in the period  including add on licenses to existing clients and new client transactions  as well as revenues from contract backlog that had not previously been recognized pending contract performance that occurred or was completed during the period  and certain other activities during the period associated with client relationships 
in the aggregate  these periodic revenues can contribute significantly to earnings in the period because relatively little in period costs are associated with such revenues other than those costs associated with networking services 
we expect these periodic revenues to continue to fluctuate on an annual basis as a result of significant variations in the type and magnitude of sales and other contract and client activity in any period  and these variations make it difficult to predict the nature and amount of these periodic revenues 
the increase in software related fees in was partially offset by lower revenues from networking services due to management s decision in the third quarter of to stop selling networking products 
professional services revenues professional services revenues  which include implementation  training and consulting related services  were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in both periods resulted primarily from higher utilization of our professional services team and increased activity associated with implementation of our software following increases in previous period software sales 
hardware revenues hardware revenues decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in revenues resulted from more clients choosing other hardware sources and or reducing their hardware needs by opting for remote hosted solutions 
as remote hosting reduces clients need for hardware  future hardware revenues may be negatively impacted 
we expect hardware revenues to continue to fluctuate on an annual basis 
operating expenses cost of systems and services cost of systems and services increased by million  or  to million  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of systems and services in was primarily attributable to the following higher labor related costs of million  mainly associated with an increase in headcount and higher incentive compensation on improved financial performance  higher travel costs of million associated with increased level of sales activity  and higher consulting  software maintenance and software license costs associated with incremental implementation and software related revenues 

table of contents the increases above were slightly offset by lower amortization of capitalized software development costs of million  as costs capitalized for sunrise clinical manager xa were fully amortized as of the second quarter of cost of hardware cost of hardware decreased million  or  in the decrease in these costs was directly related to the lower hardware volumes discussed above  slightly offset by more favorable product margins 
the gross margin percentage on hardware revenue increased to in compared to in impacted by changes in product mix 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increased labor related costs of million on higher headcount  higher commissions on increased sales volumes and increased incentive compensation on improved financial performance 
the increase was also related to additional expenses for tradeshows and marketing events designed to enhance market awareness of the company s solutions 
research and development research and development expenses were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million over the prior year 
research and development expense decreased due to the higher level of internal labor cost capitalization of million associated with development work related to sunrisexa sunrisexa was released in december of the impact of higher cost capitalization was partially offset by higher labor related costs of million on increased headcount and higher incentive compensation on improved financial performance

additional increases in general and administrative expenses include higher labor related costs reflecting increased headcount and higher incentive compensation due to improved financial performance 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily the result of higher depreciation associated with the increased asset base related to the continued growth of our operations

the charges related to this plan primarily consisted of severance related expenses associated with the termination of impacted employees and included one time termination benefits and retention bonus expenses 
the plan is expected to be substantially complete in the first quarter of  with total restructuring expenses expected to approximate million  which includes the million incurred in the restructuring charges related to the reduction of headcount and the consolidation of office space 
in january  we effected a restructuring of our operations which included a reduction in headcount of approximately individuals  as part of the reorganization of our company

the benefit was also offset by accruals of probable foreign taxes and penalties relating to transfer pricing  pursuant to fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas liquidity and capital resources overview cash and marketable securities at december  were million representing an million decrease from december  this decrease primarily reflects the reclassification of million of our ars from marketable securities to non current assets

our acquisitions were primarily debt funded

in addition  many of our clients budgets rely in part on investment earnings  which have suffered given recent declines in portfolio investment values 
these recent events  to date  have not materially impacted the quality of our accounts receivable balances or our ability to access our credit facility as evidenced by our december borrowing of million to fund the premise corporation acquisition price and related transaction fees

future capital requirements as of december   our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents balances and marketable securities of million 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities combined with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our current operations for the next twelve months 
as of december   million of our money market funds held at evergreen investments have been guaranteed by the us treasury money market guarantee program 
the plan ensures that if a participating fund s share value declines under and a decision is made to liquidate by the fund s board of trustees  the us treasury would cover any shortfall between the share price at the time of liquidation and for investors as of september  this guarantee is effective until april  as of december   the company held approximately million par value of investments in auction rate securities ars of which million was purchased through ubs financial services ubs and million was purchased through goldman sachs 
as of december   our ars purchased through ubs are entirely comprised of aaa rated pools of student loans  and our ars purchased through goldman sachs are comprised of million of aaa rated pools of student loans and million of baa rated pools of student loans 
these investments have long term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are supposed to be reset through a dutch auction each month 
prior to february  the monthly auctions historically provided a liquid market for these securities 
however  in february  the broker dealers managing the company s ars portfolio experienced failed auctions of certain of these securities where the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
our ars continued to fail to settle at auctions through the end of the company continues to earn interest on these investments at the contractual rate 
in april  a partial call transaction was closed related to one of our ars  as a result of which we received proceeds of million 
in may  a call transaction was closed related to another one of our ars securities  as a result of which we received proceeds of million 
each of these two transactions resulted in a recovery of the full par value of the securities 
on november   we entered into a settlement agreement with ubs pursuant to which the company received the right the put option to sell its ars  originally purchased through ubs  at par value  to ubs between june  and july  and gave ubs the right to purchase the ars  originally purchased through ubs  from the company any time after the acceptance date of the settlement agreement as long as the company receives the par value of the securities 

table of contents as of december   the company has recorded these investments  including the put option  at their estimated fair value of million 
due to events in the credit markets  quoted prices in active markets are not readily available at this time 
a third party appraisal firm provided an estimate of the fair value of the ars and the put option held as of december  in order to validate the fair value estimate of these securities and the put option for reporting  the company considered the appraiser s pricing model which included factors such as credit quality  duration  insurance wraps  assumptions about future cash flows and likelihood of redemption 
the company concluded that the pricing model  given the lack of market available pricing  provided a reasonable basis for determining fair value of the ars and the put option as of december  all of our ars were at an unrealized loss position as of december  the company has accounted for the put option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option of sfas no 
this resulted in the recording of a million asset with a corresponding credit to income for the value of the put option for the year ended december  simultaneously  the company made an election pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  to transfer the related auction rate securities from available for sale to trading securities 
the transfer resulted in the reversal of prior unrealized losses  net of taxes  on the ubs purchased ars from accumulated other comprehensive income and the recognition of the unrealized losses as a charge to income of million for the year ended december  the company expects that the future changes in the fair value of the put option will be offset by the fair value movements in the related ars 
we have recorded a temporary loss on the ars purchased through goldman sachs of million  as of december   in accumulated other comprehensive income  reflecting the decline in the fair value of these securities  as these securities remain classified as available for sale 
the company has concluded that no other than temporary impairment losses occurred for the year ended december  related to these securities because the company believes that the declines in fair value that have occurred during are due to recent market liquidity conditions 
we believe these investments continue to be of high credit quality  and we currently plan to hold the ars until such time as successful auctions occur  secondary markets allow for a sufficient price to recover substantially all of our par value  or our put option becomes exercisable 
accordingly  we have classified these securities as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet 
the company will continue to analyze its ars each reporting period for impairment and it may be required to record an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations if the decline in fair value of the goldman sachs purchased ars are determined to be other than temporary 
in february we entered into a secured financing agreement with an investment bank  pursuant to which we received million in exchange for a transfer to the bank as a form of collateral of ars with a nominal value of million in the aggregate 
the company entered into this arrangement to provide funds to close our february acquisition of epsi 
on may   we entered into a credit agreement  pursuant to which the company received a senior secured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of million 
we entered into this arrangement to obtain funds to repay the million short term financing agreement 
on august   eclipsys entered into a credit agreement pursuant to which eclipsys received a senior secured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the credit facility includes a letter of credit subfacility of up to million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to million 
we have collateralized a letter of credit with million of available principal and are incurring interest expense on the outstanding letter of credit amount based on the applicable rate of plus a facing fee 
we also incur interest on the unused principal balance based on an applicable rate of 
borrowings under the credit facility may be used to pay transaction expenses  to refinance debt  for potential acquisitions and capital investments  and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
at the closing  eclipsys borrowed million under the credit facility of which million was used to repay all borrowings plus interest under eclipsys prior million credit facility and million was used to pay transaction costs 
on october   the company acquired medinotes for approximately million consisting of cash and eclipsys common stock 
the cash portion of the acquisition price and related transaction fees were financed with million borrowed from our million credit facility 
on december   we acquired premise corporation for approximately million 
the acquisition price was financed with million borrowed from our million credit facility 
as of december   eclipsys has million available for borrowings under the million credit facility 

table of contents our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors including  among other things  the timing and level of our new sales volumes  the cost of our development efforts  the success and market acceptance of our future product releases  and other related items 
the company also periodically evaluates business expansion opportunities that fit its strategic plans  such as our february acquisition of epsi  our october acquisition of medinotes  and our december acquisition of premise 
if an opportunity requiring significant capital investment were to arise  the company may seek to finance the opportunity through available cash on hand  existing financings  issuance of additional shares of its stock or additional sources of financing  as circumstances warrant 
however  there can be no assurance that adequate liquidity would be available to finance extraordinary business opportunities 
in addition  we may not be able to draw on the full available balance of our million credit facility if one or more of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us become unwilling or unable to fund such borrowings 
in the current economic environment  the chance of a syndicate bank failing to meet a funding commitment is less unlikely than under more normal circumstances  and our ability to replace a non funding bank in the syndicate is uncertain 
there can also be no assurance that our credit facility will be renewed or replaced upon its expiration on august  our ability to renew such credit facility or to enter into a new financing arrangement to replace the existing facility could be impaired if the current disruptions in us and international financial markets continue or worsen 
the recent disruptions in the financial markets can also reduce access to cash by our clients and potential clients 
in addition  many of our clients budgets rely in part on investment earnings  which have suffered given recent declines in portfolio investment values 
if healthcare information technology spending declines or increases more slowly than we anticipate  demand for our software could be adversely affected and our revenue could decline 
challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our clients to pay for our software and services for which they have contacted 
as a result  reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable may increase  with corresponding decreases in cash collections 
sfas fair value measurements due to events in credit markets quoted prices in active markets are not readily available at this time for our ars and put option 
a third party appraisal firm provided an estimate of the fair value of the ars and the put option held as of december  in order to validate the fair value estimate of these securities and the put option for reporting  the company considered the appraiser s pricing model which included factors such as credit quality  duration  insurance wraps  assumptions about future cash flows and likelihood of redemption 
the company concluded that the pricing model  given the lack of market available pricing  provided a reasonable basis for determining fair value of the ars and the put option as of december  the assumptions that were used in the model were highly subjective and therefore considered level unobservable inputs in the fair value hierarchy 
the fair value of these assets represents million or of total assets measured at fair value in accordance with sfas the estimate of the fair value of the ars we hold could change significantly based on future market conditions

contingencies on may   the mckenna system tms filed in the th judicial district court  comal county  texas  a complaint against the company stemming from an agreement between the company and mckenna health system mckenna pursuant to which mckenna agreed to acquire software and services from the company 
mckenna terminated that agreement on april  the complaint alleges various causes of action essentially amounting to breach of contract for failing to meet contractual obligations related to the software sold and the timeliness of implementation  and intentionally or negligently misleading mckenna 
tms has asserted damages of approximately million  and seeks multiple damages under various theories 
the outcome of this case and its impact on the company s results of operations depend upon questions of fact and law that are disputed or not clear and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time 
the company intends to contest this matter vigorously  including defending the allegations and pursuing mckenna s unfulfilled obligations to eclipsys 

table of contents in addition to the foregoing  the company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to other legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims incident to their business activities 
such matters may include  among other things  assertions of contract breach or intellectual property infringement  claims for indemnity arising in the course of our business and claims by persons whose employment with us has been terminated 
such matters are subject to many uncertainties  and outcomes are not predictable with assurance 
consequently  management is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability  amounts which may be covered by insurance or recoverable from third parties  or the financial impact with respect to these other matters as of december  however  based on our knowledge as of december   management believes that the final resolution of such other matters pending at the time of this report  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contracts and commitments the following table provides information related to our contractual obligations under various financial and commercial agreements as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating leases long term debt obligations unconditional purchase obligations total the unconditional purchase obligations consist of minimum purchase commitments for telecommunication services  computer equipment  maintenance  consulting and other commitments 
these amounts are expected to be funded from current cash and cash equivalent balances and the income generated from operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments or enter into foreign currency hedge transactions 
foreign currency fluctuations through december  have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we continually monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and may use derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions in the future if  in our judgment  the circumstances warrant their use 
generally  our expenses are denominated in the same currency as our revenue and the exposure to rate changes is minimal 
we believe most of our international operations are naturally hedged for foreign currency risk as our foreign subsidiaries invoice their customers and satisfy their obligations primarily in their local currencies with the exception of our development center in india 
our development center in india is not naturally hedged for foreign currency risk since their obligations are paid in their local currency but are funded in us dollars 
there can be no guarantee that foreign currency fluctuations in the future will not be significant 
we hold investments in auction rate securities ars 
these ars are debt instruments with long term nominal maturities that previously could be sold via dutch auctions every     or days creating a short term instrument 
in february  broker dealers holding the company s ars portfolio experienced failed auctions of certain ars where the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of related purchase orders 
our ars continued to fail to settle at auctions through the fourth quarter of the company continues to earn interest on these investments at the contractual rate  and the ars that the company 
table of contents holds have not been placed on credit watch by credit rating agencies 
the average interest rate earned on the majority of these investments in the second half of was between zero and two percent 
during the second half of  million comprising pools of student loans of our approximately million par value of investments in ars was downgraded from aaa rated to baa rated 
during the year ended december   we adjusted the carrying amount of our ars to estimated fair market value 
if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue and these markets deteriorate further or the company experiences any additional rating downgrades on any investments in its portfolio  the company may incur further temporary impairments or other than temporary impairments  which could negatively affect the company s financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings 
as discussed further in liquidity and capital resources  in november we entered into a put option to sell our ars to ubs between june  and july  associated with this put  we classified million of our ars as trading as of december  this classification results in fair value changes recorded to income 
the company expects that the future changes in the fair value of the put option will be offset by the fair value movements in the related ars 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the following table illustrates potential fluctuation in annualized interest income based upon hypothetical values for blended interest rates for hypothetical ars balances we currently earn interest on million par value of ars hypothetical interest rate hypothetical ars balances in thousands we estimate that a one percentage point decrease in interest rates for our investment securities portfolio as of december  would have resulted in a decrease in interest income of million for a three month period or million for a month period 
this sensitivity analysis contains certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period  and it does not consider the impact of changes in the portfolio as a result of our business needs or as a response to changes in the market 
therefore  although it gives an indication of our exposure to changes in interest rates  it is not intended to predict future results  and our actual results will likely vary 
hypothetical interest rates used in the table above are significantly lower than the analysis in the prior year due to changes in market conditions in on august   we entered into a credit agreement pursuant to which we received a senior secured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of million 
as of december   borrowings under the credit facility totaled million 
the interest rate applicable to the borrowed amount is based  at our option  on the prime rate  one month libor rate  three month libor rate  six month libor rate or month libor rate at the initial debt draw date and interest rate contract end date plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is based on our leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement and as of december  was 
our leverage ratio increases to in due to the increase in our outstanding debt 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate was calculated at 
based on borrowings of million  as of december   for each percentage point increase in the interest rate  annual interest expense would increase million
