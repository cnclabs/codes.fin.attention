under the previous policy  renewals within six months of the expiration date were extended for twelve months from the expiration date 
memberships renewed more than two months after such expiration date are extended for twelve months from the renewal date

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended sfas  in accounting for derivative and hedging activities 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business  which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts  seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency 
the forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures 
currently  these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting 
we use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions 
these contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features 
we seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships 
there can be no assurance  however  that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk 
in addition  the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report  for additional information related to these contracts 
we are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices  particularly electricity and natural gas  which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately of our warehouses and other facilities in the us and canada 
we also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments 
we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  merchandise inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  warehouse closing costs  insurance self insurance liabilities  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
revenue recognition we generally recognize sales  net of estimated returns  at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services 
when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services  the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed 
we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns 
amounts collected from members  which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes  are recorded on a net basis 
we evaluate the criteria of the fasb emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions 
generally  when we are the primary obligor  subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  influence product or service specifications  or have several but not all of these indicators  revenue is recorded on a gross basis 
if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above  we record the net amounts as commissions earned  which is reflected in net sales 
membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members 
we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis  whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period 
our executive members qualify for a reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses  up to a maximum of per year  on all qualified purchases made at costco 
we account for this reward as a reduction in sales  with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities 
the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data 
investments investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share and warehouse number data continued operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or issuer conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting  and are stated using the last in  first out lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 
we record an adjustment each quarter  if necessary  for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
at the end of  due to overall net inflationary trends  merchandise inventories valued at lifo were lower than the fifo value  resulting in a charge to merchandise costs 
during  due to overall deflationary trends  we recorded a benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at lifo 
at the end of and  merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 
we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts  which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
inventory cost  where appropriate  is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates  provided they are probable and reasonably estimable 
other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones  terms of agreement  or other systematic and rational approaches 
impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment  such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location 
our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist  requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
we provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated 
a considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability  particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations 
these estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets 
we make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location 
we reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change 
insurance self insurance liabilities we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool  to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property damage  director and officers liability  vehicle liability  and

significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions 
the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge  if any  from tax authorities 
when facts and circumstances change  we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate
