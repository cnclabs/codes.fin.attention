additional management s discussion and analysis effect of inflation and changing prices generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without consideration for change in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
virtually all assets of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a company s performance than does the effect of inflation 
commitments in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit  such as letter of credits and un advanced loan commitments  and lease obligation commitments  which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions 
the company has outstanding debt maturities  the largest of which are frb discount window and fhlb advances 
for the maturity schedule of advances and schedule of future minimum rental payments see notes and  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data

represents interest and non interest bearing checking  money market  and savings accounts market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk the objective of interest rate risk management is to contain the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the process involves identification and management of the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
managing interest rate risk is not an exact science 
the interval between repricing of interest rates of assets and liabilities changes from day to day as the assets and liabilities change 
for some assets and liabilities  contractual maturity and the actual cash flows experienced are not the same 
a good example is residential mortgages that have long term contractual maturities but may be repaid well in advance of the maturity when current prevailing interest rates become lower than the contractual rate 
interest bearing deposits without a stated maturity could be withdrawn after seven days 
however  the banks experience indicates that these funding pools have a much longer duration and are not as sensitive to interest rate changes as other financial instruments 
prime based loans generally have rate changes when the frb changes short term interest rates 
however  depending on the magnitude of the rate change and the relationship of the current rates to rate floors and rate ceilings that may be in place on the loans  the loan rate may not change 
gap analysis the following table gives a description of our gap position for various time periods 
as of december   the company had a negative gap position at six months and a negative gap position at twelve months 
the cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets for six months is a negative percent which compares to a negative percent at december  and a negative percent at december  the table also shows the gap earnings sensitivity  and earnings sensitivity ratio  along with a brief description as to how they are calculated 
the methodology used to compile this gap information is based on the company s mix of assets and liabilities and the historical experience accumulated regarding their rate sensitivity

this table estimates the repricing maturities of the company s assets and liabilities  based upon the company s assessment of the repricing characteristics of the various instruments 
interest bearing checking and regular savings are included in the categories that reflect the interest rate sensitivity of the individual programs and if the deposits are not clearly rate sensitive  the deposits are included in the more than years category 
money market balances are included in the less than months category 
mortgage backed securities are categorized based on the anticipated principal payments 
net interest income simulation the traditional one dimensional view of gap is not sufficient to show a bank s ability to withstand interest rate changes 
because of limitations in gap modeling the alco of the company uses a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s statement of financial condition 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward and bp or bp downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed as a benchmark 
other non parallel rate movement scenarios are also modeled to determine the potential impact on net interest income 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  and as compared to the percent policy limit approved by the company s and banks board of directors

the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility that the company will not be able to fund present and future obligations 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain cash flows adequate to meet current and future needs for credit demand  deposit withdrawals  maturing liabilities and corporate operating expenses 
the principal source of the company s cash revenues are dividends received from the company s bank subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends is subject to government regulation  in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the bank subsidiaries source of funds is generated by deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  sale of loans and securities  short and long term borrowings  and net earnings 
in addition  all of the bank subsidiaries are members of the fhlb 
as of december   the bank subsidiaries had million of available fhlb credit of which million was utilized 
the banking subsidiaries may also borrow funds from the frb discount window or from the us treasury tax and loan program of which the banks have remaining borrowing availability of million and million  respectively 
management of the company has a wide range of versatility in managing the liquidity and asset liability mix for each bank subsidiary as well as the company as a whole 
capital resources and adequacy maintaining capital strength has been a long term objective 
ample capital is necessary to sustain growth  provide protection against unanticipated declines in asset values  and to safeguard the funds of depositors 
capital also is a source of funds for loan demand and enables the company to effectively manage its assets and liabilities

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states often requires management to use significant judgments as well as subjective and or complex measurements in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company considers its accounting policy for the alll and determination of whether an investment security is temporarily or other than temporarily impaired to be its only critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan and lease losses accounting policy and analysis the banks charge off policy is consistent with bank regulatory standards 
consumer loans generally are charged off when the loan becomes over days delinquent 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
when such property is acquired  it is recorded at estimated fair value  less estimated cost to sell 
any write down at the time of recording real estate owned is charged to the alll 
any subsequent write downs are charged to current expense 
the balance of the alll is an estimate of probable credit losses that have occurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the date of the consolidated financial statements before losses have been confirmed 
the balance of the alll is highly dependent upon management s internal risk classifications  evaluations of borrowers current and prospective performance  appraisals and other variables affecting the quality of the loan and lease portfolio 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact upon the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
it is the company s policy to provide an alll for estimated losses on loans and leases based upon past loss experience  adjusted for changes in trends and conditions of certain items  including adverse situations that may affect specific borrowers ability to repay  current collateral values  where appropriate  delinquencies and non performing loans  amount and timing of future cash flows expected on impaired loans  criticized and classified loans  credit concentrations by credit type  industry  geography  recoveries and dispositions of balances previously charge off  volume and terms of loans  loan size and complexity  competition and bank size  local market areas and national economic conditions  effects of changes in lending policies and procedures  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and credit administration staff  and effects of legal and regulatory developments 
individually significant loans and major lending areas are reviewed periodically to determine potential problems at an early date 
the alll is increased by charges to earnings and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
for additional information regarding the alll  its relation to the provision for loan and lease losses and risk related to asset quality  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
other than temporary loss on securities accounting policy and analysis the company views the determination of whether an investment security is temporarily or other than temporarily impaired as a critical accounting policy  as the estimate is susceptible to significant change from period to period because it requires management to make significant judgments  assumptions and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company assesses individual securities in its investment securities portfolio for impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant 
an investment is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its carrying value at the financial statement date 
if impairment is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the amortized cost basis to fair value and as a charge to earnings 
management considers whether an investment security is other than temporarily impaired under the guidance promulgated in fsp sfas and sfas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments and the guidance from the securities and exchange commission found in staff accounting bulletin topic m 
in evaluating impaired securities for other than temporary impairment losses  management considers  among other things  i the severity and duration of the impairment  ii the credit ratings of the security  iii the overall deal structure  including the company s position within the structure  the overall and near term financial performance of the issuer and underlying collateral  delinquencies  defaults  loss severities  recoveries  prepayments  cumulative loss projections  discounted cash flows and fair value estimates 
the company also considers its intent and ability to retain the investment security for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value 
in so doing  the company considers i contractual constraints  liquidity and capital needs of the company  and ii management s approach to managing the investment portfolio including intent  if any  to dispose of impaired investment securities in periods subsequent to the impairment analysis date 
the company believes that macroeconomic conditions occurring in have unfavorably impacted the fair value of certain debt securities in its investment portfolio 
for securities with limited or inactive markets  the impact of these macroeconomic conditions upon fair value estimates includes higher risk adjusted discount rates and downgrades in credit ratings provided by nationally recognized credit rating agencies  eg  moody s  s p  and fitch 
equity securities owned at year end consisted of stock issued by the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve bank  such shares measured at cost for fair value purposes in recognition of the transferability restrictions imposed by the issuers 
in addition  the company owns  shares of series o preferred stock issued by federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and  shares of common stock issued by the federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
the freddie mac and fannie mae stock had a cost basis of at year end due to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment charge against earnings at september  for the entire amount of the company s investment therein 
hence  none of the equity securities were impaired at year end as of december   the company s investment portfolio had debt securities  the fair values of which had declined below amortized cost by million  or  of the value of temporarily impaired investment securities 
the company stratified the debt securities for both severity and duration of impairment 
with respect to severity  debt securities had impairment that exceeded percent of the respective book values  of which had impairment that exceeded percent of the respective book values at year end of the debt securities had impairment that exceeded percent of the respective book values at year end  the aggregate unrealized loss of which was  the remaining debt securities had impairment that was percent or less of the respective book values as of year end with respect to duration of the impairment  the company identified debt securities which have been continuously impaired during the valuation history of such securities in the prior year s was also reviewed to determine the number of months in prior year s in which the identified securities were in an unrealized loss position 
the most notable of these securities is a non guaranteed  non agency cmo which had an unrealized loss of  of the securities are mortgage backed securities issued by us government sponsored agencies  us  gnma  fnma  fhlmc and sba  the aggregate unrealized loss of which was  among the debt securities with impairment at year end are non guaranteed  non agency issued cmo tranches  each of which have been continuously rated aaa since inception 
of the cmos tranches are collateralized by year fixed residential mortgages considered to be prime  and are collateralized by year fixed residential mortgages considered to be alt a 
moreover  none of the underlying mortgage collateral is considered subprime 
in assessing the various factors identified above  the company evaluated the fair value estimates provided by third party vendors  including models and methodology  for appropriate consideration of both observable and unobservable inputs  including appropriately adjusted discount rates and credit spreads for securities with limited or inactive markets 
the company obtained independent estimates of inputs  including cash flows  in supplement to third party vendor provided information 
the company also reviewed financial statements of issuers  with follow up discussions with issuers management for clarification and verification of information relevant to the company s impairment analysis 
with respect to the company s intent and ability to hold the securities impaired at december   the company had no present intent to sell any of such securities 
during  the company also continued its historical approach to managing the investment portfolio  ie  to buy and hold securities to maturity  although such securities may be sold given that all of the securities held in the investment portfolio are designated as available for sale 
in  the company sold only security at neither gain nor loss for proceeds of  such security was acquired and held for days as collateral to support a borrowing at the u 
s treasury tax and loan program 
sales of securities in occurred with respect to entire investment portfolios of acquired banks following mergers into the company s existing bank subsidiaries 
such sales occurred in recognition that the acquired portfolios of investments were not consistent with the company s investment policy and asset liability management policy 
during  the only investment security sold was a bond issued by general motors  the risk profile of which was not consistent with the company s revised investment policy 
based on the analysis of its impaired debt securities  the company determined it was probable the company will fully recover the amortized cost of the securities  and that none of such securities had other than temporary impairment 
fair value measurements on january   the company adopted sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fas also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities on a recurring basis  the company measures investment securities in accordance with sfas the fair value of such investments is estimated by obtaining quoted market prices for identical assets  where available 
if such prices are not available  fair value is based on independent asset pricing services and models  the inputs of which are market based or independently sourced market parameters  including  but not limited to  yield curves  interest rates  volatilities  prepayments  defaults  cumulative loss projections  and cash flows 
for those securities where greater reliance on unobservable inputs occurs  such securities are classified as level within the hierarchy 
in performing due diligence reviews of the independent asset pricing services and models for investment securities  the company reviewed the vendors inputs for fair value estimates and the recommended assignments of levels within the fair value hierarchy 
the company s review included the extent to which markets for investment securities were determined to have limited or no activity  or was judged to be an active market 
the company reviewed the extent to which observable and unobservable inputs were used as well as the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions about risk that a market participant would use in active markets  with adjustments for limited or inactive markets 
in considering the inputs to the fair value estimates  the company placed less reliance on quotes that were judged to not reflect market transactions  or were non binding indications 
the company made independent inquires of other knowledgeable parties in testing the reliability of the inputs  including consideration for illiquidity  credit risk  and cash flow estimates 
in assessing credit risk  the company reviewed payment performance  collateral adequacy  credit rating histories  and issuers financial statements with follow up discussion with issuers 
for those markets determined to be inactive  the valuation techniques used were models for which management verified that discount rates were appropriately adjusted to reflect illiquidity and credit risk 
the company independently obtained cash flow estimates that were stressed at levels that exceeded those used by independent third party pricing vendors 
based on the company s due diligence review  investment securities are placed in the appropriate hierarchy levels with adjustment to vendors recommendations made as necessary 
most notably  the company determined that its collateralized debt obligation securities  ie  trust preferred securities  were illiquid due to inactive markets ie  due to the absence of trade volume during  the fair values of which had significant reliance on unobservable inputs  and therefore were classified as level within the hierarchy 
on a non recurring basis  the company measures impaired loans in accordance with sfas allowable methods for estimating fair value of impaired loans include using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans or  where a loan is determined not to be collateral dependent  using the discounted cash flow method 
impaired loans are primarily collateral dependent and the estimated fair value is based on the appraised fair value of the collateral 
the company reviews the appraisals  giving consideration to the highest and best use of the collateral 
the appraised values are reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and estimated cost to sell 
impaired loans are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
in addition to measuring certain financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or non recurring basis  the company discloses estimated fair value on financial assets and liabilities 
the following is a description of the methods and inputs used to estimate the fair value of other financial instruments recognized at amounts other than fair value 
the fair value for unimpaired loans  net of alll  is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates at which similar notes would be originated for the same remaining maturities 
the market rates used are based on current rates the bank subsidiaries would impose for similar loans and reflect a market participant assumption about risks associated with non performance  illiquidity  and the structure and term of the loans along with local economic and market conditions 
the fair value of term deposits is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates of similar deposits with similar maturities 
the market rates used were obtained from a knowledgeable independent third party and reviewed by the company 
the rates were the average of current rates offered by local competitors of the bank subsidiaries 
the estimated fair value of demand  now  savings  and money market deposits is the book value since rates are regularly adjusted to market rates 
the fair value of the non callable fhlb advances is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates of similar advances with similar maturities 
these rates were obtained from current rates offered by fhlb 
estimated fair value of callable fhlb advances was obtained from fhlb and the model was reviewed by the company through discussions with fhlb 
the fair value of term repurchase agreements is estimated based on current repurchase rates currently available to the company for repurchases agreements with similar terms and maturities 
the market rates used are based on current rates the bank subsidiaries would incur for similar borrowings 
the estimated fair value for overnight repurchase agreements and other borrowings is book value 
the fair value of the subordinated debentures is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using current estimated market rates for subordinated debt issuances with similar characteristics 
the market rates used were obtained from an independent third party and include inputs such as implied yield curves and interest rate spreads 
the company evaluated the independent fair value estimate by comparison to the company s internal calculation
