item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general although current forecasts regarding world wide demand for coal and natural gas are less robust than estimates a year ago because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding global economic growth  the company believes that the long term fundamentals of population growth  a desire for improved living standards  and the need to build or repair critical infrastructure in many countries will be the primary drivers for energy over the next several decades 
in the short term  economic stimulus spending by the united states and other countries should result in improvements in demand for coal and gas as infrastructure projects are initiated and economic activity increases 
in the short term  base loading of eastern u 
s 
power generation in the key markets will continue to create demand for consol s high btu coal 
on the supply side  coal production challenges related to permitting  new safety regulations  and complex geology in appalachia are expected to keep supplies tight 
the company believes it is in a strong position in the near term for a number of reasons the company has a significant amount of anticipated coal and gas production already committed for sale  the company s low volatile metallurgical coal and its high btu british thermal units steam coal are premium products that should command premium prices even in a weaker demand environment  the company expects to generate strong cash flows during the next months  reflecting both higher priced tons entering the sales mix and the relatively low cost position of both its coal and gas segments  the company s relatively low debt and strong liquidity position allows the company to maintain its reputation as a disciplined producer and to make adjustments to production should market conditions require it  in addition the company has no principal debt payments due in and the company s revolving line of credit is in place through  and the company has the flexibility to defer or slow certain capital project outlays without undercutting the company s fundamental growth strategy 
during the second and third quarters of  a number of factors impacted coal production  but no single factor dominated 
factors included events such as roof falls on main line belt haulage  regulatory issues  particularly related to safety that impacted productivity and costs  technological issues  particularly the challenge of completing development of new longwall coal panels as rapidly as required  and geologic issues such as roof conditions and intrusion of rock into coal seams 
we have made a number of important changes that positively impacted productivity and production in the fourth quarter  resulting in a reduction in costs 
we have taken various steps with respect to the development issue because it is key to maximizing efficiency from our longwall equipped mines 
the company has added crews and changed work schedules to increase longwall panel development  has worked with equipment manufacturers to develop better haulage systems for continuous mining machines to increase rates of advance in development sections of the mine  and is modifying mine plans in a number of longwall equipped mines to increase the ratio of coal produced by the longwall equipment compared to that produced by the continuous miners 
some of the changes we have made  such as adding additional crews  have given us immediate benefits 
other activities  such as mine plan modifications  may take several quarters to fully execute 
however  over the next year  we expect the aggregate result of these actions will positively impact productivity 
regulatory impacts on production are more difficult to manage 
most producers in the eastern us are being impacted by government regulations and enforcement to a much greater extent than a few years ago 
the 
table of contents pace with which government issues permits needed for on going operations to continue mining has negatively impacted expected production  especially in central appalachia 
environmental groups in southern west virginia and kentucky have challenged state and us army corps of engineers permits for mountaintop mining on various grounds 
the most recent challenges have focused on the adequacy of the corps of engineers analysis of impacts to streams and the adequacy of mitigation plans to compensate for stream impacts 
in  the us district court of the southern district of west virginia found other operators permits for mining in these areas to be deficient 
the ruling is currently in appeals 
the legal issues around these previously issued permits have delayed or prevented the issuance of new permits by the corps of engineers 
currently  consol energy s surface operations in these areas have been impacted to a limited extent  but the delay or denial of additional permits could impact some or all of the surface operations within the next twelve to twenty four months 
in addition  over the past few years  the length of time needed to bring a new mine into production has increased by several years because of the increased time required to obtain necessary permits 
new safety laws and regulations have impacted productivity at underground mines  although the company has not yet been able to ascertain the exact amount of the impact 
on october  the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa act was signed into law 
the eesa act contains a section that authorizes certain coal producers and exporters who have filed a black lung excise tax blet return on or after october   to request a refund of the blet paid on export sales 
the eesa act requires that the us treasury refund a coal producer or exporter an amount equal to the blet erroneously paid on export sales in prior years along with interest computed at the statutory rates applicable to overpayments 
consol energy filed timely claims for refunds under the eesa act of the blet with the internal revenue service in the amount of approximately million 
in addition  the estimated interest related to the blet refunds expected to be received is approximately million 
in relation to this receivable  consol energy also recognized approximately million of expense that will be owed to third parties upon collection of the refunds 
consol energy believes that it will receive refunds of blet erroneously paid on export sales in the amounts requested in its filing with the internal revenue service plus interest as required by the act prior to december  our subsidiary  cnx gas completed the independent verification process for several chicago climate exchange ccx approved projects relating to the capture of coalbed methane 
approximately million metric tons of emissions offsets were verified and registered on the ccx in the year ended december  ccx is a rules based greenhouse gas ghg allowance trading system 
ccx emitting members make a voluntary but legally binding commitment to meet annual ghg emission reduction targets 
those emitting members who exceed their targets have surplus allowances to sell or bank  those who fall short of their targets comply by purchasing offset which are called ccx carbon financial instruments cfi contracts 
as a ccx offset provider  cnx gas is not bound to any emission reduction targets 
an offset provider is an owner of an offset project that registers and sells offsets on its own behalf 
sales of these emission offsets will be reflected in income as they occur 
consol energy also verified approximately million metric tons of additional emission offsets 
consol energy has engaged a broker through which we will evaluate emission credit opportunities on the over the counter market 
sales of these emission offsets will be reflected in income as they occur 
to date  no offsets have been sold by either consol energy or cnx gas 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income net income changed primarily due to the following items table in millions period period dollar variance percentage change sales outside sales purchased gas sales gas royalty interest freight outside other income total revenue and other income coal cost of goods sold and other and purchased charges purchased gas costs gas royalty interest costs total cost of goods sold freight expense selling  general and administrative expense depreciation  depletion and amortizaton interest expense black lung excise tax refund taxes other than income total costs earnings before income taxes and minority interest income tax expense earnings before minority interest minority interest net income consol energy had net income of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  net income for increased in comparison to due to higher average prices received for both coal and gas  higher volumes of gas sold  included a total of approximately million of pre tax expenses  net of insurance recoveries  related to the buchanan mine incident that occurred in july which idled the mine through march  the period includes approximately million of pre tax income related to this incident  black lung excise tax refund receivable recognized for taxes paid in due to legislation passed in october  and receivable write off of million in related to the supreme court decision which rendered the black lung excise tax receivable for uncollectible 
these increases in net income were offset  in part  by an asset exchange and an asset sale in that resulted in pretax income of approximately million and net income of approximately million  increased unit cost of goods sold and other charges for both coal and gas 

table of contents see below for a more detailed description of variances noted 
the cost per unit below is not necessarily indicative of unit costs in the future 
revenue revenue and other income increased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change sales produced coal purchased coal produced gas industrial supplies other total sales outside gas royalty interest purchased gas freight revenue other income total revenue and other income the increase in company produced coal sales revenue during was due to higher average prices  offset  in part  by slightly lower volumes of produced coal sold 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the increase year to year in the average sales prices of coal was the result of global coal fundamentals being more favorable in the current year 
concerns regarding the adequacy of global supplies of coal have strengthened both the international and domestic coal prices and have increased the opportunity for us producers to increase exports of coal 
sales tons were slightly lower in the year to year comparison 
purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications  coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants 
the increase of million in company purchased coal sales revenue was primarily due to an increase in volumes of purchased coal sold in the year to year comparison 
the increase in produced gas sales revenue in compared to was primarily due to higher average sales prices and higher volumes of gas sold 
variance percentage change produced gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet the increase in average sales price is the result of cnx gas  an subsidiary at december   realizing general market price increases in the year to year comparison 
cnx gas periodically enters into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges 
these gas swap transactions exist 
table of contents parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these financial hedges represented approximately bcf of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per mcf 
in the prior year  these financial hedges represented approximately bcf at an average price of per mcf 
sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program 
also  prior year sales volumes were impacted by the deferral of production at the buchanan mine 
the million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to the july acquisition of piping equipment  inc in addition to an overall increase in sales volumes and higher sales prices 
the million increase in other sales was attributable to increased revenues from barge towing and terminal services 
the increase was primarily related to revenue generated from the barge towing operations having higher average rates for services rendered compared to the prior year 
the barge towing operations have also increased thru put tons and delivered tons in increases in other sales revenues were also attributable to higher terminal services as a result of additional thru put tons in the higher terminal revenues were offset  in part  due to services being suspended for approximately one month due to maintenance needed on a pier in baltimore 
variance percentage change gas royalty interest sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet included in gas royalty interest sales volumes are the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by cnx gas on their behalf 
the increase in market prices  contractual differences among leases and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the year to year change 
variance percentage change purchased sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet purchased gas sales volumes represent volumes of gas that were sold at market prices that were purchased from third party producers  less gathering fees 
freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
freight revenue has increased million in due primarily to freight associated with amvest  which was acquired on july  freight revenue has also increased due to higher freight rates being charged for exported tons 
these increases in freight revenue were offset  in part  by lower export tons shipped in compared to there were million tons and million tons of coal exported by consol energy in and  respectively

dollar variance percentage change gain on sale of assets interest income litigation settlement equity in earnings of affiliates railroad spur income proceeds from relinquishment of mining rights royalty income contract towing business interruption proceeds other miscellaneous total other income gain on sale of assets decreased million in the year to year comparison primarily due to two transactions that occurred in in june  consol energy  through our owned subsidiary  cnx gas  exchanged certain coal assets in northern appalachia to peabody energy for coalbed methane and gas rights  which resulted in a pretax gain of million 
also  in june  consol energy  through a subsidiary  sold the rights to certain western kentucky coal in the illinois basin to alliance resource partners  lp for million 
this transaction also resulted in a pretax gain of approximately million 
the period reflects a sale of an idled facility which included the transfer of the mine closing liabilities to the buyer 
this transaction resulted in a pretax gain of approximately million 
there was also a million increase in the year to year comparison due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
interest income decreased million in the year to year comparison due to lower cash balances throughout compared to lower cash balances were primarily the result of the purchase price paid for the june acquisition of the remaining interest in knox energy  llc  the july acquisition of several leases and gas wells from kis oil gas  inc  the july  acquisition of amvest  the june purchase of certain coalbed methane and gas rights from peabody energy and the july buchanan mine incident 
a litigation settlement with a coal customer in resulted in million of income 
a litigation settlement with a royalty holder resulted in million of income in equity in earnings of affiliates increased million related to our interest in a specialty contracting company  our interest in a real estate development company and our interest in a coal mining company 
these increases were offset  in part  by the june acquisition of our remaining interest in knox energy  llc 
income related to a railroad spur acquired with the july acquisition of amvest increased million 
this income was due to reimbursements from the rail carrier for maintenance completed on the spur during the year 
the income is offset in its entirety with the related expenses reflected in cost of goods sold and other charges 
in  approximately million was received from a third party in order for consol energy to relinquish the mining of certain in place coal reserves 
royalty income increased million in the year to year comparison due to production of consol energy coal by a third party commencing in august royalties have also increased due to the higher sales price of coal sold throughout compared to 
table of contents the million increase in contract towing services represents river towing services for third parties which consol energy now provides 
these services were minimal in in  consol energy received million as final settlement of the insurance claim related to the july buchanan mine incident  which idled the mine from july to mid march the million represents business interruption coverage which was recognized in other income  the coal segment recognized million and the gas segment recognized million 
consol energy had received million of business interruption proceeds related to this incident in  the coal segment recognized million and the gas segment recognized million 
in  million was also received from the insurance carrier for reimbursement of fire brigade costs 
this was recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold and other charges as discussed below 
the final settlement brought the total amount recovered from insurance carriers to million  the maximum allowed per covered event 
no additional amounts related to the buchanan roof caving event will be recovered 
all proceeds from this insurance claim have been received 
other miscellaneous income increased million in the year to year comparison due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both years  none of which were individually material 
costs cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following dollar variance percentage change cost of goods sold and other charges produced coal purchased coal produced gas industrial supplies closed and idle mines other total sales outside gas royalty interest purchased gas total cost of goods sold increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to a higher average unit cost per ton sold  offset slightly by lower sales volumes 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton average cost of goods sold and other charges increased in the year to year comparison primarily due to an increase in average unit costs related to the following items 
supply and maintenance costs have increased per ton sold due to the following items the increase in supply and maintenance costs reflects the change in the mix of sales tons in compared to production tons from the northern appalachian underground mines decreased  while production from the central appalachian mines increased 
this was primarily due to the july  acquisition of amvest and to the buchanan mine being idled for half of 
table of contents the installation of higher grade seals and a higher number of seals being built in contributed to the increase in supply cost 
the mine health and safety administration now requires higher strength seals to be constructed in order to isolate old  abandoned areas or previously sealed areas of the mine 
at several locations  the installed seals are also required to be stronger 
the increase in strength of seals was required to better protect the active sections of the underground mines from explosions  fires  or other situations that may occur within the sealed areas 
the installation of higher strength seals and a higher number of seals being completed contributed to the increase in supply costs 
higher roof control costs are attributable to higher usage of products used in the mining process due to mining conditions and additional development work 
development work by continuous mining machines requires more roof support products than are used in the area of the mine where extraction is done using a longwall mining system 
roof control costs have also increased due to higher usage of pumpable cribs which are more expensive per unit than the standard wooden crib support 
the pumpable crib is a canvas cylinder hung from the roof and extending to the floor into which concrete is pumped 
because the pumpable crib allows concrete to be pumped to the roof level  it eliminates the need to use wood shims to tighten the concrete to the roof 
the pumpable crib is quicker to install  enhances safety due to the customized fit and minimizes the use of combustible products at underground locations 
also  roof control costs have increased due to approximately a inflation rate related to roof control products 
gas well plugging drilling costs related to the mining process have increased in compared to gas well plugging expenses are related to plugging abandoned gas wells which consol energy does not own that are in front of the underground mining process 
these wells have to be plugged in accordance with current safety regulations in order to mine through 
consol energy has plugged more wells in than in  which has contributed to increased supply costs 
gas well drilling ahead of mining  vents the gas from the coal seam which then allows for the longwall process to extract coal from a ventilated seam 
consol energy drilled more wells ahead of mining in than in primarily due to buchanan mine being idled for half of  as previously discussed 
higher fuel and explosive costs are due to the general increase of these commodities in the year to year comparison 
the amvest surface locations were acquired on july  these surface locations are a large consumer of these products 
higher equipment maintenance costs are also attributable to the acquisition of amvest on july  these increases in supply costs were offset  in part  by expenses for self contained self rescuers which were purchased in in compliance with the miner act 
there were fewer self contained self rescuers purchased in labor costs have increased per ton sold due to the effects of wage increases at the union and non union mines from labor contracts which began in these contracts call for specified hourly wage increases in each year of the contract 
labor also increased due to a higher number of employees in compared to this was somewhat due to the utilization of new work schedules requiring more manpower and operations trainees 
other post employment benefit costs have increased per ton sold primarily due to a change in the discount rate used to calculate the net periodic benefit costs 
the weighted average discount rate for was and was in combined fund costs have increased per ton sold due to the settlement with the fund 
in march  consol energy entered into a settlement agreement with the combined fund that resolved all previous issues relating to the calculation of the payments 
the total income  including interest  as a result of this settlement was approximately million  of which approximately million impacted cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal 

table of contents health retirement costs have increased per ton sold due to additional contributions required to be made into employee benefit funds in compared to as a result of the five year labor agreement with the united mine workers of america umwa that commenced january  the contribution increase over was per umwa hour worked 
in transit costs have increased per ton sold 
in transit costs are costs to move coal from the point of extraction to the preparation plant in order for the coal to be processed for sale 
these costs have increased due primarily to increased trucking expenses related to higher fuel costs as well as several locations operating in the current year that did not operate in various other costs have increased per ton sold due to various items that have occurred throughout both periods  none of which individually increased or decreased costs per ton sold 
purchased coal cost of goods sold consists of costs from processing purchased coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications  coal purchased and sold directly to customers and costs for processing third party coal in our preparation plants 
the increase of million in purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges in was primarily due to higher volumes purchased 
gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to a increase in volumes of produced gas sold and an increase in unit costs of goods sold and other charges 
variance percentage change produced gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet average cost of goods sold and other charges per unit sold increased in the current year as a result of the following items fuel and power increased per thousand cubic feet for both lifting and gathering combined 
this increase was primarily due to additional compressors being placed in service along the existing gathering systems in order to flow gas more efficiently 
well closing costs were impaired per thousand cubic feet in the year to year comparison 
well closing liabilities were adjusted in to reflect longer well lives than were previously estimated 
this adjustment resulted in a reduction to expense 
the adjustments to well closing liabilities were insignificant in water disposal costs have increased per thousand cubic feet due to additional volumes of water produced by cnx gas wells in compared to repairs and maintenance costs have increased per thousand cubic feet due to higher material costs and higher contract labor costs 
compression expenses increased per thousand cubic feet due to the additional compressors discussed above 
various other costs have also increased by per thousand cubic feet for various items which occurred throughout both years  none of which were individually material 
industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased million primarily due to the july acquisition of piping equipment  inc the increase was also related to additional volumes of goods sold and higher costs of good sold throughout closed and idle mine cost of goods sold decreased approximately million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to million of lower cost of goods sold and other charges at shoemaker mine 

table of contents shoemaker resumed longwall production in may  but was idled throughout all of the decrease was also related to updated engineering surveys related to mine closing  perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liabilities for closed and idled locations resulting in million of expense in compared to million of expense in the higher survey adjustments related primarily to perpetual water treatment changes in estimates of water flows and increased hydrated lime costs 
closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges also increased million due to various other charges which occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually significant 
other cost of goods sold decreased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change buchanan roof collapse contract settlement incentive compensation ward superfund site accounts receivable securitization railroad spur expenses asset impairment stock based compensation profit splits sales contract buy outs terminal river operations miscellaneous total of the cost of goods sold and other charges in july  production at the buchanan mine was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine  requiring a general evacuation of the mine 
in  we have incurred approximately million of cost of goods sold and other charges related to the buchanan mine event compared to million in the prior year 
the expense figure is net of million related to insurance proceeds received as reimbursement for costs incurred under the policy 
the mine resumed longwall production on march  in  consol energy agreed to a million settlement for a contract violation with a customer 
the incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when consol energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets 
incentive compensation expense decreased million due to the level of earnings in comparison to the predetermined performance target in the year to year comparison 
the year ended december  includes expense of million related to the ward transformer superfund site 
in  revised estimates of total costs related to this site were received 
the revised estimates indicate an increase in costs to remediate the site 
the year ended december  includes million of expense related to this site
