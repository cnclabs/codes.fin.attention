item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general since the late s  we have derived virtually all of our revenue from the sale of suspension assemblies to a small number of customers 
we currently supply a variety of suspension assemblies and suspension assembly components to nearly all domestic and foreign based manufacturers of disk drives and head gimbal assemblers for all sizes of disk drives 
suspension assemblies are a critical component of disk drives  and our results of operations are highly dependent on the disk drive industry 
the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and demand for disk drive components fluctuates 
our results of operations are affected from time to time by disk drive industry demand changes  adjustments in inventory levels throughout the disk drive supply chain  technological changes that impact suspension assembly demand  shifts in our market position and our customers market position  changes in supply chain alignment by a customer  our customers production yields and our own product transitions  production yields and production capacity utilization 
due to the weak economy  consumer spending declined and retail demand for computers and other consumer electronics decreased in  as well as business demand for computer systems  and demand for suspension assemblies therefore was adversely impacted 
our biomeasurement division is engaged in the development  production and commercialization of products for the medical device market 
net sales from the inspectra sto system during  our second full year in the market  were  although we incurred an operating loss in for our biomeasurement division 
the number of customers for the inspectra sto system totaled as of september   up from at the end of the preceding fiscal year 
the installed base of inspectra sto systems  which totaled more than at the end of the fiscal year  nearly tripled over over the course of  there were also more than publications or presentations that documented the value of sto monitoring 
in our biomeasurement division  we expect to reach  to  of net sales in in response to weakened demand and due to changing and uncertain market and economic conditions  in we took actions to reduce our cost structure and improve our cash flow to help us to meet the current portion of our debt obligations and make strategic investments as needed 
to achieve improvements in efficiency and facility utilization and to reduce operating costs  we closed our sioux falls  south dakota facility at the end of june and consolidated the related suspension assembly operations into our eau claire  wisconsin and hutchinson  minnesota sites 
we also consolidated photoetching operations into our hutchinson  minnesota site and trace operations into our eau claire  wisconsin site 
in addition to the weakened demand  during the third quarter of  we were notified by our customer  seagate  that it intends to significantly reduce its procurement of suspension assemblies from us 
these events resulted in the following actions and charges that are included in our consolidated financial statements we recorded a charge for severance and other expenses of  due to our elimination of approximately  positions company wide or a reduction of our employment levels compared to the end of  we recorded non cash impairment charges of  for the impairment of long lived assets related to manufacturing equipment in our disk drive components division s assembly and component operations including the closure of our sioux falls  south dakota facility at the end of june  we reduced our capital spending from an expected  in the beginning of to  primarily for tooling and manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements 
at the time the restructuring actions were complete  we estimated that all of our restructuring actions reduced our cost structure by approximately  on an annualized basis compared with costs 
we began to realize the full benefit of these cost reductions in our fourth quarter of in addition  over the course of the year  we repaid approximately  or  of our convertible debt on favorable terms 
deterioration in our business  however  or further disruption in the global credit and financial markets and related continuing adverse economic conditions  could further adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently project our capital spending in to be approximately  which includes  to establish our asian assembly operation to manufacture our disk drive products 
we have selected thailand as the location with a goal of initiating production in the second half of calendar this operation will further enhance our long term cost position  as well as our ability to serve our customers operations in asia 
in the long term  we believe that end user demand for storage capacity will continue to increase as evolving consumer electronics and computing applications continue to require storage devices with increased capacity and functionality  which will increase disk drive demand and  therefore  suspension assembly demand 
for calendar  storage industry analysts expect disk drive shipments to reach million units  an increase of about from calendar which was slowed by the global recession 
during the first half of  however  world wide demand for disk drives and suspension assemblies weakened significantly 
the weakened demand resulted in a decline in disk drive production as the drive makers reduced inventory levels  which also reduced demand for our suspension assemblies 
this lower demand combined with our market share losses during this period resulted in our suspension assembly sales volume decreasing from the first half of in addition  during the third quarter of we were notified by our customer  seagate  that it intends to significantly reduce its procurement of suspension assemblies from us 
while demand for our suspension assemblies recovered somewhat in the second half of  our shipments of suspension assemblies for the year declined from for  we expect our overall suspension assembly volume to  at minimum  keep pace with the world wide demand for suspension assemblies  resulting in a return to year over year volume growth 
we believe we have positioned our business to accommodate both possible instability in suspension assembly demand  and the resumption in year over year demand growth that we expect 
as our tsa volumes increase  and as our tsa yields and process efficiencies continue to improve  we are steadily reducing the cost burden associated with tsa flexure production 
our strategies to achieve consistent profitability include expanding tsa adoption  improving our tsa production efficiency  initiating production in thailand and growing revenue in our biomeasurement division 
the following table sets forth our quarterly suspension assembly shipment quantities for our disk drive components division in millions for the periods indicated by quarter by quarter first second third fourth first second third fourth suspension assembly shipment quantities the decrease in the second quarter of was primarily the result of our customers lower build plans during the seasonally slower quarter  our market share losses in the inch ata segment and share shifts among our customers in the inch mobile segment 
our third quarter shipments increased primarily due to gains in the inch mobile segment 
our fourth quarter shipments increased due to seasonally stronger demand for disk drives 
our first quarter shipments decreased significantly due to an unforeseen decline in world wide disk drive shipments and a reduction of inventories in the supply chain 
despite the decline in overall quarterly volume  we estimate that our market share was unchanged compared to the preceding quarter 
our second quarter shipments decreased primarily due to lower demand for disk drives  lower disk drive production as the drive makers reduced inventory levels and a modest loss of overall market share 
the share loss was primarily in the inch ata segment that was partially offset by share gains in the inch ata segment 
our third quarter shipments increased compared with the preceding quarter as a result of stronger demand in every segment 
our fourth quarter shipments were flat compared to third quarter despite a decline in shipments to seagate that was expected 
for  our average selling price decreased from in the first half of to in the fourth quarter of due to competitive pressures 
our average selling price continued to decline to in the first quarter of  in the second and third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of the decline in average selling price from the first quarter to the second quarter of was primarily due to a shift in product mix as our combined shipments for the mobile and enterprise segments declined more than sequentially  while shipments for the inch ata segment increased by approximately 
the year over year decline in average selling price was larger than our historical pricing declines for similar periods due to the shift in product mix and competitive pressures 
we expect continued downward pressure on our average selling price in  although not to the extent experienced in our gross profits have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate based upon a variety of factors  key among them being changes in demand for our suspension assemblies 
our customers often prefer a multiple source supply strategy and  therefore  may allocate their demand among suppliers 
we plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand  including forecasts of customer pulls of product out of our vmi facilities 
certain agreements with our customers also provide that we maintain minimum finished goods inventory levels for them 
both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially 
these factors  among others  create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary significantly from week to week  leading to variability in gross profits and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace 
in addition to increases in suspension assembly demand  improvements to our gross profits and operating profits will depend  in part  on the successful management of our corporate infrastructure and our suspension assembly production capacity 
our business is capital intensive and requires a high level of fixed costs 
our profits are sensitive to our level of fixed costs  as well as changes in volume  capacity utilization and product mix 
in the future  we may need to adjust our overall employment level due to fluctuating demand 
our overall employment level was  at the end of   at the end of and  at the end of market trends our suspension assemblies are components in computers and a variety of consumer electronics products 
the demand for these products can be volatile 
in a weak economy as we are currently experiencing  consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for computers and other consumer electronics tends to decrease  as does business demand for computer systems 
demand for suspension assemblies therefore may be adversely impacted as a result of a weaker economy 
in the long term  however  we expect that the expanding use of enterprise computing and storage  desktop and mobile computers  increasingly complex software and the growth of new applications for disk storage  such as digital video recorders and personal storage devices  together with emerging opportunities in other consumer electronics applications  will increase disk drive demand and  therefore  suspension assembly demand 
we also believe demand for disk drives will continue to be subject  as it has in the past  to rapid or unforeseen changes resulting from  among other things  changes in disk drive inventory levels  technological advances  responses to competitive price changes and unpredicted high or low market acceptance of new drive models and the end devices that disk drives are used in 
in addition  disk drive manufacturers are increasingly seeking lower cost designs and suspension assembly pricing is highly competitive 
as in past years  disk drives continue to be the primary storage device of choice for applications requiring shorter access times and higher capacities because of their speed and low cost per unit of stored data 
the cost of storing data on disk drives continues to decrease primarily due to increasing data density  thereby increasing storage capacity in disk drives or reducing the number of components  including suspension assemblies  required in a disk drive 
the continual pursuit of increased data density and lower storage costs is leading to suspension assemblies with flexures that have finer electrical conductors  greater lead counts and increased complexity such as interleaved or stacked traces  and to the adoption of value added features for suspension assemblies  such as clad unamount arms  formed and polished headlifts  larger dampers with through hole features  a variety of limiter configurations and dsa 
we are actively involved with several of our customers on dsa designs and prototypes 
the development of next generation read write technology and head sizes  continuing improvement in data density and the use of disk drives in consumer electronics applications will require even finer electrical conductors on the suspension assembly 
next generation disk drives also may require additional electrical conductors 
we are investing significantly in developing the process capabilities and related capital equipment required to meet new industry specifications in and beyond 
the introduction of new types or sizes of read write heads and disk drives may initially decrease our customers yields with the result that we may experience temporary elevations of demand for some types of suspension assemblies 
as programs mature  higher customer yields decrease the demand for suspension assemblies 
the advent of new disk drive technologies and the continual pursuit of increased data density and lower storage costs are leading to suspension assemblies that will require finer electrical conductors and further adoption of value added features for suspension assemblies 
while we are generally able to increase our selling price for these suspension assemblies  these changes may temporarily increase our development spending and reduce our manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
these changes will continue to affect us 
operations to operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales from period to period 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses severance and other expenses litigation charge asset impairment and other charges loss from operations gain on extinguishment of debt other income  net interest income expense gain loss on short and long term investments loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss income net sales for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  suspension assembly sales decreased  compared to  primarily as a result of a decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments and our average selling price decreasing from an average of in to an average of in due to competitive pressures  resulting in a lower average selling price year over year 
the decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments in was primarily due to lower demand for disk drives  lower disk drive production as the drive makers reduced inventory levels and loss of market share 
net sales in our biomeasurement division were  in and  in gross profit for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  gross profit as a percent of net sales was in  compared to in the lower gross profit in was primarily due to the substantial decline in net sales  which reduced our ability to cover our fixed costs  and excess capacity 
cost of sales also included costs associated with tsa flexure production  which reduced gross profit by  compared to  for these negative impacts on gross profit were partially offset by decreases during the year in manufacturing overhead expense 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease was primarily related to lower labor expenses due to reduced headcount and lower supply expenses 
research and development expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in research and development expenses as a percent of net sales were in and in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the lower selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to lower expenses  including reductions in labor expenses resulting from lower headcount  depreciation expenses  professional services expenses and recruitment and relocation expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were in and in selling  general and administrative expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in during the third quarter of  we took actions to reduce operating costs  including eliminating approximately positions company wide 
the workforce reduction resulted in a charge for severance expenses of in response to weakened demand and due to changing and uncertain market and economic conditions  we took actions to reduce our cost structure and strengthen our cash position in during the first quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan that included eliminating positions company wide 
during january  we eliminated approximately  positions 
the workforce reduction resulted in a charge for severance and other expenses of  which was included in our financial results for the thirteen weeks ended december  in addition  we implemented a pay reduction for all employees not affected by the workforce reduction 
during the second quarter of  in response to further weakened demand for suspension assemblies  we took actions to further restructure the company and reduce our overall cost structure in our disk drive components division 
we initiated the closure of our sioux falls  south dakota facility  which we completed at the end of june  and consolidated the related suspension assembly operations into our eau claire  wisconsin and hutchinson  minnesota sites 
the assembly operations consolidation resulted in a net elimination of approximately positions 
in addition  we consolidated photoetching operations into our hutchinson  minnesota site and trace operations into our eau claire  wisconsin site to achieve improvements in efficiency and facility utilization and to reduce operating costs 
we also reduced the workforce in our components operation in eau claire  wisconsin by approximately positions 
the second quarter workforce reductions resulted in a charge for severance and other expenses of during the third quarter of  we took additional actions to reduce costs and improve cash flow 
we further restructured the company to adjust to market conditions and the expected significant reduction of suspension assembly shipments to our customer  seagate 
the restructuring actions included eliminating approximately additional positions  bringing our overall employment to about  positions at the end of the third quarter of the third quarter workforce reductions resulted in a charge for severance and other expenses of during  we recorded a litigation charge of  related to the tentative settlement of a class action lawsuit 
the lawsuit challenged our pay practices pertaining to the time certain production employees spend gowning and ungowning at the beginning and end of their shifts and meal breaks 
the charge was comprised of settlement payments to these employees and payment of their attorney s fees and expenses 
during the first quarter of  we recorded non cash impairment charges of  for the impairment of long lived assets related to manufacturing equipment in our disk drive components division s assembly and component operations 
the impairment review was triggered by weakened demand for suspension assemblies and uncertain future market conditions 
in response to these conditions  we made structural changes to consolidate some of our component and assembly manufacturing among our sites 
during the second quarter of  in response to further weakened demand for suspension assemblies and as a result of the restructuring actions in the second quarter discussed above  we recorded additional non cash impairment charges of  for the impairment of long lived assets related to manufacturing equipment in our disk drive components division s assembly and component operations 
during the third quarter of  as a result of the expected significant reduction of suspension assembly shipments to our customer  seagate  and as a result of the restructuring actions in the third quarter discussed above  we recorded additional non cash impairment charges of  for the impairment of long lived assets primarily related to assembly manufacturing equipment in our disk drive components division 
loss from operations for included a  loss from operations for our biomeasurement division compared to a  loss for the increased loss from biomeasurement operations was due to higher allocated expenses from corporate departments as the business has grown and to severance expenses 
interest income for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower investment yields as a result of an overall lower interest rate environment 
interest expense for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in interest expense for was primarily due to lower capitalized interest expense resulting from reduced capital investments and reduced interest expense due to our debt repurchases during the fiscal year 
during  we recorded a gain of  related to the rights offering and increased value of our ars due to changes in the interest rate spread used in our discounted cash flow model  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of  related to an other than temporary impairment of our long term investments to reflect the reduction in carrying value of our ars from a par value of  to an estimated fair value of  in light of then current uncertain market and economic conditions  we concluded we may not hold our ars until final maturity up to years if the opportunity arises to sell these securities on reasonable terms 
during the first  third and fourth quarters of  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at varying discount to face value 
we have  par value of the notes outstanding 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
we have  par value of the notes outstanding 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
the income tax benefit of  was based on an estimated annual effective tax rate of the income tax benefit for is due primarily to certain provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of that permit certain tax credits to be converted into cash refunds in lieu of claiming bonus depreciation  which was partially reduced by foreign income tax expense 
the income tax provision for was  or an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 
the pretax loss for resulted in a statutory tax benefit of  the negative annual effective tax rate was caused by the full valuation allowance charge of  against our deferred tax assets 
the guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
under that standard  our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor 
this loss  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
accordingly  we concluded that a full valuation allowance is appropriate 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable  and our valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
operations to operations net sales for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  suspension assembly sales decreased  compared to  primarily as a result of a decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments and our average selling price decreasing from in the first half of to in the fourth quarter of due to competitive pressures  resulting in a lower average selling price year over year 
the decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments in was primarily due to share loss for our suspension assemblies used in inch ata disk drives  a customer s accelerated purchases late in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in lower demand from that customer in the first quarter of and our fiscal year calendar having weeks 
the year over year decline in average selling price resulted primarily from competitive pressures 
sales of suspension assembly components to other suspension assembly manufacturers were  a decrease of  suspension assembly component sales decreased as our customers programs utilizing our components reached the end of their market lives 
net sales in our biomeasurement division were  in and  in gross profit for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  gross profit as a percent of net sales was in  compared to in the lower gross profit in was primarily due to the lower suspension assembly and suspension assembly component sales discussed above and higher costs associated with the initiation of volume production of tsa suspension assemblies  which reduced gross profit by  our gross profit also remained under pressure from capacity utilization that was below an ideal operating level 
these negative impacts on gross profit were partially offset by decreases in manufacturing overhead expense 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease was primarily attributable to  of lower expenses related to the classification of the costs of running the tsa manufacturing lines as cost of sales beginning in the fourth quarter of and  of lower depreciation expenses related to customer tooling 
research and development expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in research and development expenses as a percent of net sales were in and in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the lower selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to  of lower travel and recruitment expenses   of lower labor expenses in the disk drive components division due to a decrease in the number of personnel and  of lower professional services expenses 
these were partially offset by a  increase in labor expenses for our biomeasurement division primarily due to added sales personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in during the third quarter of  we took actions to reduce operating costs  including eliminating approximately positions company wide 
the workforce reduction resulted in a charge for severance expenses of during  we recorded a litigation charge of  related to the tentative settlement of a class action lawsuit 
the lawsuit challenged our pay practices pertaining to the time certain production employees spend gowning and ungowning at the beginning and end of their shifts and meal breaks 
the charge was comprised of settlement payments to these employees and payment of their attorney s fees and expenses 
during the third quarter of  we recorded charges of  comprised of severance expenses for approximately positions eliminated during the quarter and the write off of design costs for a cancelled facility expansion 
the workforce reduction resulted in a charge for severance expenses of  the positions eliminated included manufacturing and manufacturing support  administrative and development positions at all plant sites 
the write off of design costs for the cancelled facility expansion amounted to  loss from operations for included a  loss from operations for our biomeasurement division compared to a  loss for other income  net of other expenses  for was  compared to  in  a decrease of  other income consists primarily of royalty income 
interest income for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower investment yields as a result of a change in our investment portfolio to united states treasury instruments  partially offset by interest related to an amended sales and use tax return and higher average cash balances 
interest expense for was  compared to  for  an increase of  the increase in interest expense for was primarily due to lower capitalized interest expense resulting from reduced capital investments 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of  related to an other than temporary impairment of our long term investments to reflect the reduction in carrying value of our ars from a par value of  to an estimated fair value of  in light of current uncertain market and economic conditions  we concluded we may not hold our ars until final maturity up to years if the opportunity arises to sell these securities on reasonable terms

the pretax loss for resulted in a statutory tax benefit of  the negative annual effective tax rate was caused by the full valuation allowance charge of  against our deferred tax assets 
the guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
under that standard  our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor 
this loss  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance was appropriate 
accordingly  we concluded that a full valuation allowance should now be established 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable  and our valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the income tax benefit for was  or an estimated annual effective tax rate of 
the pretax loss for resulted in a statutory tax benefit of  the income tax benefit was increased by the research and development tax credit and the foreign sales corporation fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of eie provisions related to the export of united states products 
the income tax benefit for includes reductions for discrete items  including a benefit of  for the completion of a research and development tax credit study which identified additional qualified research expenditures from prior years   due to a favorable internal revenue service private letter ruling resulting in the release of certain valuation allowances and a benefit from the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit retroactive to january  liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  cash flow from operations and additional financing capacity  if available given current credit market conditions and our operating performance 
our cash and cash equivalents increased from  at september   to  at september  our short and long term investments decreased from  to  during the same period 
in total  our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments decreased by  this decrease was primarily due to  used for repurchases of long term debt and  for capital expenditures 
these decreases were partially offset by  in net proceeds drawn from the ubs credit line discussed below   of cash generated from operations  and  in net proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment during the cash generated from operations is net of  of severance and other expenses paid in our ars portfolio had an aggregate par value of  at september  and  at september  the reduction in par value was due to sales and redemptions of portions of the ars that we held 
we determine the estimated fair value of our ars portfolio each quarter 
at september   we estimated the fair value of our ars portfolio to be  throughout  we sold and redeemed an aggregate of  of our ars for  in cash 
as of september   the estimated fair value of our ars portfolio was  the increase in fair value from september   includes  of realized and unrealized gains related to the rights offering discussed below and increased value of ars due to changes in the interest rate spread used in our discounted cash flow model 
our ars portfolio consists primarily of aaa aaa rated securities that are collateralized by student loans that are primarily guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
none of our ars portfolio consists of mortgage backed obligations 
prior to february  the ars market historically was highly liquid and our ars portfolio typically traded at auctions held every or days 
starting in february  most of the ars auctions in the marketplace have failed  including auctions for all of the ars we hold  meaning that there was not enough demand to sell the entire issue at auction 
the immediate effect of a failed auction is that the interest rate on the security generally resets to a contractual rate and holders cannot liquidate their holdings 
the contractual rate at the time of a failed auction for the majority of the ars we hold is based on a trailing twelve month ninety one day us treasury bill rate plus or a one month libor rate plus 
other contractual factors may result in rate restrictions based on the profitability of the issuer or may impose temporary rates that are significantly higher or lower 
we continue to earn and receive interest at these contractual rates on our ars portfolio 
our ars portfolio will continue to be offered for auction until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the security  the security matures after a term of up to years  the ars are repurchased pursuant to the rights offering or  in light of recent uncertainties in the global credit and financial markets  we may decide not to hold to final maturity if the opportunity arises to sell these securities on reasonable terms 
there is no assurance that future auctions of securities in our ars portfolio will be successful 
as a result  our ability to voluntarily liquidate and recover the carrying value of some or our entire ars portfolio may be limited for an indefinite period of time up to a maximum of each security s final maturity date 
this limitation could negatively affect our overall liquidity 
effective december   we entered into a settlement the ubs settlement with ubs ag  ubs financial services inc and ubs securities llc collectively  ubs to provide liquidity for our ars portfolio held with ubs and to resolve pending litigation we had filed against ubs 
the ubs settlement provides for certain arrangements  one of which is our acceptance of an offer by ubs to issue to us ars rights the rights offering  which allow us to require ubs to repurchase at par value all of the ars held by us in accounts with ubs at any time during the period from june   through july  if our ars have not previously been sold by us or by ubs on our behalf or redeemed by the respective issuers of those securities 
in addition  ubs has the right to sell the ars it holds on our behalf at any time on or before july   as long as we are paid the par value of the securities upon their disposition 
as part of the ubs settlement  we also entered into a loan agreement with ubs credit corp 
ubs credit  which provides us with a line of credit the ubs credit line secured only by the ars we hold in accounts with ubs 
the proceeds derived from any sales of the ars we hold in accounts with ubs will be applied to repayment of the ubs credit line 
as of september   we had drawn down  of the ubs credit line available to us 
ubs credit may demand payment of borrowings under the ubs credit line only if it provides a replacement credit facility on substantially the same terms to us that is fully advanced in the amount of the then outstanding principal of the ubs credit line  or if it repurchases all of the pledged ars at par 
our borrowing under the ubs credit line is treated as a no net cost loan  which means that the interest that we pay on the credit line will not exceed the interest that we receive on the ars pledged by us as security for the ubs credit line 
the rate for the majority of the ars we hold is based on a trailing twelve month ninety one day us treasury bill rate plus 
other contractual factors may result in rate restrictions based on the profitability of the issuer or may impose temporary rates that are significantly higher or lower 
ubs credit may demand payment of borrowings under the ubs credit line only if it provides a replacement credit facility on substantially the same terms to us that is fully advanced in the amount of the then outstanding principal of the ubs credit line  or if it repurchases all of the pledged ars at par 
we will continue to assess the impact that the current illiquidity of the ars we continue to hold will have on our ability to execute our current business plan 
our current business plan  however  is subject to change depending on  among other things  deterioration in our business  further disruption in the global credit and financial markets and related continuing adverse economic conditions 
our ability to execute our current business plan may in the future be impacted by the continued illiquidity of our ars investments 
in january  we issued  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of january  the indenture 
interest on the notes is payable on january and july of each year  which began on july  we have the right to redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes on or after january  at specified redemption prices  as provided in the indenture  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the applicable redemption date 
holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on january   january   and january   or in the event of a fundamental change  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the purchase date 
under certain circumstances  holders of the notes may convert their notes based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
upon conversion  in lieu of shares of our common stock  for each  principal amount of notes a holder will receive an amount in cash equal to the lesser of i  or ii the conversion value  determined in the manner set forth in the indenture  of the number of shares of our common stock equal to the conversion rate 
if the conversion value exceeds  we also will deliver  at our election  cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock with respect to the remaining common stock deliverable upon conversion 
if a holder elects to convert such holder s notes in connection with a fundamental change that occurs prior to january   we will pay  to the extent described in the indenture  a make whole premium by increasing the conversion rate applicable to such notes 
during the fourth quarter of  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
after the note repurchase  we have  par value of the notes outstanding 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
in february  we issued and sold  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually  which began on september  the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into our common stock at any time prior to their stated maturity  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion price of per share 
beginning march   the notes became redeemable  in whole or in part  at our option at of their principal amount  and thereafter at prices declining to on march  in addition  upon the occurrence of certain events  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof  together with accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any  for the period to  but excluding  the date of the repurchase 
during november  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of approximately  was included in our consolidated financial statements 
during june  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled

during august  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
after these repurchases  we have  par value of the notes outstanding 
we may from time to time seek to prepay or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
these transactions  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
on june   we terminated our credit facility the credit facility  which was subject to a second amended and restated loan agreement  dated as of december   by and among the company  our wholly owned subsidiary hutchinson technology asia  inc hta  and bank of america na bofa  as successor by merger to lasalle bank national association lasalle 
we had previously amended the terms of the credit facility on november  by the second amendment to second amended and restated loan agreement  by and among the company  hta and bofa 
we have cash management accounts at bofa 
the credit facility  as amended  had a maturity date of december  we terminated the credit facility because we did not intend to incur additional debt under it before its maturity date and we were uncertain as to our ability to comply with its financial covenants in future periods 
the termination of the credit facility included the termination of all liens provided for therein 
as of its termination  we had no outstanding loans under the credit facility 
we did not incur any penalties associated with the termination of the credit facility 
a further deterioration in our business or further disruption in the global credit and financial markets and related continuing adverse economic conditions would impact our ability to obtain new financing 
we may not be able to obtain new financing on terms acceptable to us  including covenants that we will be able to comply with in the short term 
if we are unable to obtain new financing  if and when necessary  our future financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
our suspension assembly business is capital intensive 
the disk drive industry experiences rapid technology changes that require us to make substantial ongoing capital expenditures in product and process improvements to maintain our competitiveness 
significant industry technology transitions often result in increasing our capital expenditures 
the disk drive industry also experiences periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction  which also results in fluctuations in our capital expenditures 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease from to was primarily due to the weakened demand for our suspension assemblies in and our actions to reduce our overall cost structure and increase our cash position 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately  in  primarily for establishing a thailand assembly operation  and tooling and manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements 
as the full transition to tsa suspensions takes place over the next three to five years  our capital expenditures could increase as we add capacity as needed 
financing of these capital expenditures will be principally from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments  our credit facility or additional financing  if available given current credit market conditions 
our capital expenditures for the disk drive components division are planned based on anticipated customer demand for our suspension assembly products  market demand for disk drives  process improvements to be incorporated in our manufacturing operations and the rate at which our customers adopt new generations of higher performance disk drives and next generation read write technology and head sizes  which may require new or improved process technologies  such as additive processing to produce flexures for our tsa suspensions 
capital spending is also based on our ability to fund capital expenditures  as needed  with cash generated from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  the credit facility or additional financing  if available given current capital market conditions 
we manage our capital spending to reflect the capacity that we expect will be needed to meet disk drive industry customer forecasts 
however  existing work in process with vendors and lengthy lead times sometimes prevent us from adjusting our capital expenditures to match near term demand 
this can result in underutilization of capacity  which could lower gross profit 
we will continue to spend significant amounts of money on medical device sales and marketing and research and development in our biomeasurement division  which will limit the division s profitability 
in  our biomeasurement division incurred an operating loss of  and we expect the division to continue to incur losses for these losses  along with growing working capital needs as the business grows  will negatively affect our ability to generate cash 
on may   we entered into an agreement to sell our real property in sioux falls  south dakota and certain related personal property for cash consideration of  the sale closed on july  the sale resulted in a gain of  which was recorded in our fourth quarter of we closed our sioux falls  south dakota facility at the end of june and consolidated the related suspension assembly operations into our eau claire  wisconsin and hutchinson  minnesota sites 
on february   we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to spend up to  to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
in  we spent  to repurchase million shares at an average price of 
the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the share repurchase plan is  all of our repurchases during were made on the open market 
there were no share repurchases in during and  we entered into contracts to hedge gold commodity price risks through february the fair value of these contracts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  was  included in other current assets 
the fair value of these contracts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  was  included in other current assets and  included in accrued expenses 
the effective portion is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amount is net of tax  with a full valuation allowance recorded against it 
the gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in cost of sales as the commodities are consumed 
ineffectiveness is calculated as the amount by which the change in fair value of the derivatives exceeds the change in fair value of the anticipated commodity purchases and is recorded in cost of sales 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative instruments 
in light of current uncertain market and economic conditions  we are aggressively managing our cost structure and cash position to ensure that we will meet our current debt obligations while preserving the ability to make investments that will enable us to respond to customer requirements and achieve long term profitable growth 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and additional financing  if needed and as available given current credit market conditions and our operating performance  will be sufficient to meet our forecasted operating expenses  obligations at maturity of our notes in march  other debt service requirements  debt and equity repurchases and capital expenditures through holders of our  par value of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash as early as january  our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results and general economic and capital market conditions 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all  if needed 
contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations at september  in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years debt interest expense operating leases total as of september   the fin liability balance for uncertain tax positions was  we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
during  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at varying discount to face value rates 
after the repurchase  we have  par value of the notes outstanding 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
also  during september  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
after the note repurchase  we have  par value of the notes outstanding 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs associated with products sold are classified as revenue 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
certain of our products are delivered on an fob destination basis 
we defer our revenue associated with these transactions until the product has been delivered to the customer s premises 
we also store disk drive components division inventory in vmi facilities  which are warehouses located close to the customer s manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from such facilities upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
we also enter into arrangements with customers that provide us with reimbursement for engineering services and specific program capacity to partially offset the costs of our investment 
we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated life of the program to which the services and capacity relate 
investments we account for securities available for sale in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance regarding accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which requires that available for sale and trading securities be carried at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses deemed to be temporary on available for sale securities are reported as other comprehensive income oci within shareholders investment 
realized gains and losses and decline in value deemed to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in gain loss on short and long term investments and other income on our consolidated statements of operations 
trading gains and losses also are included in gain loss on short and long term investments 
fair value of the securities is based upon quoted market prices in active markets or estimated fair value when quoted market prices are not available 
the cost basis for realized gains and losses on available for sale securities is determined on a specific identification basis 
we classify our securities available for sale as short or long term based upon management s intent and ability to hold these investments 
in addition  throughout  the fasb issued various authoritative guidance and enhanced disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities which helps in determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
our ars portfolio is classified as short and long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  we believe that long term classification is appropriate for part of our ars portfolio due to the uncertainty of when we will be able to sell some of these securities 
as of the date of this report  there was insufficient observable ars market information available to directly determine the fair value of our investments 
using the limited available market valuation information  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of the investments 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market by analyzing market conditions  current sales prices  inventory costs and inventory balances 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers and a limited number of product programs for each customer 
because our products are custom built  we typically cannot shift work in process or finished goods from customer to customer or from one program to another for a particular customer 
we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or market based on the analysis 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value would generally be determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized based on future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or a benefit within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances arise due to the uncertainty of realizing deferred tax assets 
at september   and september   we had valuation allowances of  and  respectively 
the fasb guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
under the guidance  our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor 
this loss  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance was appropriate 
accordingly  we concluded that a full valuation allowance is appropriate 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable  and our valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
other matters see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law on october  the ajca contains two provisions that affect us 
the first provision is the repeal of the eie provisions  which were phased out on a calendar year basis with the benefit ending december  the second provision of the ajca that affects us is the introduction of a deduction for a percentage of income from domestic production activities 
the deduction is limited in any fiscal year in which a taxpayer uses nol carryforwards 
for and  we did not realize any benefit from this deduction as we have unused nol carryforwards 
the deduction is phased in on a calendar year basis and will be fully phased in for our fiscal year ending september  inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial condition 
we cannot be sure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risk on our debt obligations that are subject to fixed interest rates 
interest rate changes  however  would affect the fair market value of this fixed rate debt 
at september   we had fixed rate debt of  with a fair market value of approximately  our investing activities are guided by an investment policy  which is reviewed at least annually by our board of directors  and whose objectives are preservation and safety of capital  maintenance of necessary liquidity and maximizing of the rate of return within the stated guidelines 
our policy provides guidelines as to the maturity  concentration limits and credit quality of our investments  as well as guidelines for communication  authorized securities and other policies and procedures in connection with our investing activities 
we are exposed to various market risks and potential loss arising from changes in interest rates in connection with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held in investment accounts 
our ars portfolio had an aggregate par value of  at september  and  at september  the reduction in par value was due to sales and redemptions of portions of the ars that we held 
we determine the estimated fair value of our ars portfolio each quarter 
at september   we estimated the fair value of our ars portfolio to be  throughout  we sold and redeemed an aggregate of  of our ars for  in cash 
as of september   the estimated fair value of our ars portfolio was  the increase in fair value from september   includes  of realized and unrealized gains related to the rights offering and increased value of ars due to changes in the interest rate spread used in our discounted cash flow model 
our ars portfolio consists primarily of aaa aaa rated securities that are collateralized by student loans that are primarily guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
none of our ars portfolio consists of mortgage backed obligations 
prior to february  the ars market historically was highly liquid and our ars portfolio typically traded at auctions held every or days 
starting in february  most of the ars auctions in the marketplace have failed  including auctions for all of the ars we hold  meaning that there was not enough demand to sell the entire issue at auction 
the immediate effect of a failed auction is that the interest rate on the security generally resets to a contractual rate and holders cannot liquidate their holdings 
the contractual rate at the time of a failed auction for the majority of the ars we hold is based on a trailing twelve month ninety one day us treasury bill rate plus or a one month libor rate plus 
other contractual factors may result in rate restrictions based on the profitability of the issuer or may impose temporary rates that are significantly higher or lower 
we continue to earn and receive interest at these contractual rates on our ars portfolio 
our ars portfolio will continue to be offered for auction until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the security  the security matures after a term of up to years  the ars are repurchased pursuant to the rights offering or  in light of recent uncertainties in the global credit and financial markets  we may decide not to hold to final maturity if the opportunity arises to sell these securities on reasonable terms 
there is no assurance that future auctions of securities in our ars portfolio will be successful 
as a result  our ability to voluntarily liquidate and recover the carrying value of some or our entire ars portfolio may be limited for an indefinite period of time up to a maximum of each security s final maturity date 
this limitation could negatively affect our overall liquidity 
effective december   we entered into the ubs settlement to provide liquidity for our ars portfolio held with ubs and to resolve pending litigation between the parties 
the ubs settlement provides for certain arrangements  one of which is our acceptance of an offer by ubs to issue to us ars rights pursuant to the rights offering  which allow us to require ubs to repurchase at par value all of the ars held by us in accounts with ubs at any time during the period from june   through july  if our ars have not previously been sold by us or by ubs on our behalf or redeemed by the respective issuers of those securities 
in addition  ubs has the right to sell the ars it holds on our behalf at any time on or before july   as long as we are paid the par value of the securities upon their disposition 
as part of the ubs settlement  we also entered into the ubs credit line  secured only by the ars we hold in accounts with ubs 
the proceeds derived from any sales of the ars we hold in accounts with ubs will be applied to repayment of the ubs credit line 
as of september   we currently have drawn down  of the ubs credit line available to us 
ubs credit may demand payment of borrowings under the ubs credit line only if it provides a replacement credit facility on substantially the same terms to us that is fully advanced in the amount of the then outstanding principal of the ubs credit line  or if it repurchases all of the pledged ars at par 
our borrowing under the ubs credit line is treated as a no net cost loan  which means that the interest that we pay on the credit line will not exceed the interest that we receive on the ars pledged by us as security for the ubs credit line 
the rate for the majority of the ars we hold is based on a trailing twelve month ninety one day us treasury bill rate plus 
other contractual factors may result in rate restrictions based on the profitability of the issuer or may impose temporary rates that are significantly higher or lower 
ubs credit may demand payment of borrowings under the ubs credit line only if it provides a replacement credit facility on substantially the same terms to us that is fully advanced in the amount of the then outstanding principal of the ubs credit line  or if it repurchases all of the pledged ars at par 
our ars portfolio and the rights offering are classified as short and long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of the ars portfolio was reclassified as short term due to the terms of the ubs settlement  which includes the rights offering 
the balance of the ars portfolio is classified as long term due to the uncertainty of when we will be able to sell these securities 
as of the date of this report  there was insufficient observable ars market information available to directly determine the fair value of our investments  including the rights offering 
using the limited available market valuation information  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of the investments and recorded an unrealized gain of  plus an other than temporary realized gain of  as of september  this overall increase in fair value was due to a favorable change in the interest rate spread used in our discounted cash flow model 
we elected the fair value option described in note below on september   and subsequently elected to treat the portion of our ars portfolio subject to the rights offering as trading securities valued under the fair value method 
accordingly  we recorded a benefit of  as of december   related to the rights offering in long term investments on our consolidated balance sheets and a corresponding gain in other income on our consolidated statements of operations 
as of september   we reduced the estimated fair value of the rights offering to  the valuation models we used to estimate the fair market values included numerous assumptions such as assessments of credit quality  contractual rate  expected cash flows  discount rates  expected term and overall ars market liquidity 
our valuations are sensitive to market conditions and management judgment and can change significantly based on the assumptions used 
if we are unable to sell our ars at auction or our assumptions differ from actual results  we may be required to record additional impairment charges on these investments 
we will continue to assess the impact that the current illiquidity of a portion of our ars will have on our ability to execute our current business plan 
our current business plan  however  is subject to change depending on  among other things  deterioration in our business  further disruption in the global credit and financial markets and related continuing adverse economic conditions 
our ability to execute our current business plan may in the future be impacted by the continued illiquidity of our ars investments 
all of our sales transactions in our disk drive components division are denominated in united states dollars and thus are not subject to risk due to currency exchange fluctuations 
certain sales transactions in our biomeasurement division are denominated in foreign currencies 
we have established policies governing our use of derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instruments or any instruments for which the fair market values are not available from independent third parties 
we manage counter party risk by entering into derivative contracts only with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and by limiting the amount of exposure to each financial institution 
the terms of certain derivative instruments contain a credit clause under which each party has a right to settle at market if the other party is downgraded below investment grade 
as of september   the fair market value of all derivative contracts on our consolidated balance sheet was a net asset of  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative instruments
