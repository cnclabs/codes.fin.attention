part i item business overview we are a global medical technology company that develops  manufactures and markets noninvasive patient monitoring products that improve patient care 
we were incorporated in california in may and reincorporated in delaware in may we invented masimo signal extraction technology  or masimo set  which provides the capabilities of measure through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry to address the primary limitations of conventional pulse oximetry 
pulse oximetry is the noninvasive measurement of the oxygen saturation level of arterial blood  or the blood that delivers oxygen to the body s tissues  and pulse rate 
our masimo set platform has addressed many of the previous technology limitations and has been referred to by several industry sources as the gold standard in pulse oximetry 
the benefits of masimo set have been validated in over independent clinical and laboratory studies 
during fiscal  we generated product revenue of million and we increased our revenue at a compound annual growth rate  or cagr  of approximately for the three years ended january  we develop  manufacture and market a family of noninvasive blood constituent patient monitoring solutions that consists of a monitor or circuit board and our proprietary single patient use and reusable sensors and cables 
in addition  we offer remote alarm monitoring solutions  such as the masimo patient safetynet 
our solutions and related products are based upon our proprietary masimo set algorithms 
this software based technology is incorporated into a variety of product platforms depending on our customers specifications 
we sell our products to end users through our direct sales force and certain distributors  and some of our products to our original equipment manufacturer  or oem  partners  for incorporation into their products 
we estimate that the worldwide installed base of our pulse oximeters and oem monitors that incorporate masimo set was approximately  units as of january  our installed base is the primary driver for the recurring sales of our sensors  most notably  single patient adhesive sensors 
based on industry reports  we estimate that the worldwide pulse oximetry market was over billion  as of january   the largest component of which was the sale of sensors 
our strategy is to utilize the reliability and accuracy of our masimo set platform  along with our patient safetynet solutions  to facilitate the expansion of our pulse oximetry products into areas beyond critical care settings  including the general care areas of the hospital 
additionally  we have developed products that noninvasively monitor parameters beyond arterial blood oxygen saturation level and pulse rate  which create new market opportunities in both the critical care and non critical care settings 
in  we launched our masimo rainbow set platform utilizing licensed rainbow technology  which we believe includes the first devices cleared by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to noninvasively measure select noninvasive blood parameters that previously required invasive procedures 
in  we launched carboxyhemoglobin  allowing measurement of carbon monoxide levels in the blood 
in  we launched methemoglobin  allowing for the measurement of a dangerous condition known as methemoglobinemia  which occurs as a reaction to some common drugs used in hospitals and in out patient procedures 
in  we launched plethysmographic variability index  or pvi 
independent clinical studies have demonstrated that pvi can predict fluid responsiveness in surgical and intensive care patients 
in may  we received fda approval for our most recent rainbow measurement  total hemoglobin 
total hemoglobin is defined as the oxygen carrying component of red blood cells  and is one of the 
table of contents most frequent invasive laboratory measurements in the world  often measured as part of a complete blood count 
we believe that the use of products incorporating rainbow technology will become widely adopted for the noninvasive monitoring of these parameters 
we also believe that we will develop and introduce additional parameters in the future based on our proprietary technology platforms 
our technology is supported by a substantial intellectual property portfolio that we have built through internal development and  to a lesser extent  acquisitions and license agreements 
as of january   we had issued and pending patents worldwide 
we have exclusively licensed from our development partner  masimo laboratories  inc  or masimo labs  the right to incorporate rainbow technology into our products intended to be used by professional caregivers  including  but not limited to  hospital caregivers and emergency medical services  or ems  facility caregivers 
on january   we settled a patent litigation dispute with nellcor puritan bennett  inc  a division of tyco healthcare currently covidien ltd under the terms of the settlement  nellcor has agreed to discontinue the sale of its products found to infringe our patents and will pay us royalties at least through march  on the us sales of its pulse oximetry products 
on august   we completed our initial public offering  or ipo  of common stock in which a total of  shares were sold  comprised of  shares sold by selling stockholders   shares sold by us at the initial closing and  shares sold by us pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option  at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from the ipo  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and estimated other offering costs of approximately million 
upon the closing of the ipo  all shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended december   including share and per share amounts  include the effects of the offering since it was completed prior to december  industry background pulse oximetry has gained widespread clinical acceptance as a standard patient vital sign measurement because it can give clinicians an early warning of low arterial blood oxygen saturation levels  known as hypoxemia 
early detection is critical because hypoxemia can lead to a lack of oxygen in the body s tissues  which can result in brain damage or death in a matter of minutes 
pulse oximeters are currently used primarily in critical care settings  including emergency departments  surgery  recovery rooms  intensive care units  or icus  and emergency medical services  or ems market 
in addition  clinicians use pulse oximeters to estimate whether there is too much oxygen in the blood  a condition called hyperoxemia 
in premature babies  hyperoxemia can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness 
by ensuring that oxygen saturation levels in babies remain under  clinicians believe they can lower the incidence of hyperoxemia 
hyperoxemia can also cause problems for adults  such as increased risk of postoperative infection and tissue damage 
in adults  to prevent hyperoxemia  clinicians use pulse oximeters to administer the minimum level of oxygen necessary to maintain normal saturation levels 
pulse oximeters use sensors attached to an extremity  typically the fingertip 
these sensors contain two light emitting diodes  or leds  that in a transmittance sensor transmit red and infrared light from one side of the extremity through the tissue to a photodetector on the other side of the extremity 
the photodetector in the sensor measures the amount of red and infrared light absorbed by the tissue 
a microprocessor then analyzes the changes in light absorption to provide a continuous  real time measurement of the amount of oxygen in the patient s arterial blood 
pulse oximeters typically give audio and visual alerts  or alarms  when the patient s arterial blood oxygen saturation level or pulse rate falls outside of a designated range 
as a result  clinicians are able to immediately initiate treatment to prevent the serious clinical consequences of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia 
limitations of conventional pulse oximetry conventional pulse oximetry is subject to technological limitations that reduce its effectiveness and the quality of patient care 
in particular  when using conventional pulse oximetry  arterial blood signal recognition can be distorted by motion artifact  or patient movement  and low perfusion  or low arterial blood flow 
motion artifact can cause conventional pulse oximeters to inaccurately measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation level due mainly to the movement and recognition of venous blood 
venous blood  which is partially depleted of oxygen  may cause falsely low oxygen saturation readings 
low perfusion can also cause the failure of the conventional pulse oximeter to obtain an accurate measurement 
conventional pulse oximeters cannot distinguish oxygenated hemoglobin  or the component of red blood cells that carries oxygen  from dyshemoglobin  which is hemoglobin that is incapable of carrying oxygen 
in addition  conventional pulse oximetry readings can also be impacted by bright light and electrical interference from the presence of electrical surgical equipment 
independent  published research shows that conventional pulse oximeters are subject to operating limitations  including inaccurate measurements  which can lead to the non detection of a hypoxemic event or improper and unnecessary treatment  
table of contents false alarms  which occur when the pulse oximeter falsely indicates a drop in the arterial blood oxygen saturation level which can lead to improper therapy  the inefficient use of clinical resources as clinicians respond to false alarms  or the non detection of a true alarm if clinicians become desensitized to frequently occurring false alarms  and signal drop outs  which is the loss of a real time signal as the monitor attempts to find or distinguish the pulse  which can lead to the non detection of hypoxemic events 
published independent research shows that over of the alarms were false outside the operating room using conventional pulse oximetry 
in addition  in the operating room  conventional pulse oximeters failed to give measurements at all due to weak physiological signals  or low perfusion  in approximately of all cases studied 
manufacturers of conventional pulse oximeters have attempted to address some of these limitations  with varying degrees of success 
some devices have attempted to minimize the effects of motion artifact by repeating the last measurement before motion artifact is detected  until a new  clean signal is detected and a new measurement can be displayed  known as freezing values 
other devices have averaged the signal over a longer period of time  known as long averaging  in an attempt to reduce the effect of brief periods of motion 
these solutions  commonly referred to as alarm management techniques  mask the limitations of conventional pulse oximetry 
several published studies have demonstrated that some of these alarm management techniques have actually contributed to increased occurrences of undetected true alarms  or events where hypoxemia occurs  but is not detected by the pulse oximeter 
conventional pulse oximetry technology also has several practical limitations 
because the technology cannot consistently measure oxygen saturation levels of arterial blood in the presence of motion artifact or low perfusion  the technology is not sufficiently robust to allow for its use in non critical care settings of the hospital  such as general care areas  where the hospital staff to patient ratio is significantly lower 
in order for pulse oximetry to become a standard patient monitor in these settings  these limitations must be overcome 
in addition  conventional pulse oximeters cannot distinguish oxygenated hemoglobin  or the component of red blood cells that carries oxygen  from dyshemoglobin  which is hemoglobin that is incapable of carrying oxygen 
the most prevalent forms of dyshemoglobins are carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin 
as a result of these dyshemoglobins  pulse oximeters will report falsely high oxygen levels when they are present in the blood 
although currently there are lab based tests that detect dyshemoglobins  they are invasive and do not provide immediate or continuous results 
pulse oximetry market opportunity the pulse oximetry market consists of pulse oximeters and consumables  including single patient use and reusable sensors  cables and other pulse oximetry accessories that are primarily sold to the hospital and ems markets 
according to a frost sullivan report dated march  it was estimated that us pulse oximetry sensor market would increase to million by according to a frost sullivan report dated december  it is estimated that the us pulse oximetry equipment market would increase to million by based on these estimates  the total us pulse oximetry market will be million in  with between and cagr 
frost sullivan expects the growth in the us pulse oximetry market to be driven by ongoing adoption of low perfusion  motion tolerant technology  aggressive awareness campaigns  rising patient acuity  or severity of illnesses  which increases the need for monitoring in the intermediate and sub acute settings  expansion of the market for pulse oximetry monitoring to the general surgical floor  greater efficiencies for the health care worker through increased reliability  improved detection algorithms and the ability to reject false alarms  and adoption of pulse oximetry outside the hospital and in the faster growing alternate care market 
based on this frost sullivan estimate for the us market and other available estimates for markets outside the us  we estimate that the worldwide pulse oximetry market will be more than billion in according to the december frost sullivan report  masimo and nellcor each comprised of the total us pulse oximetry monitoring equipment market in according to january market research report from idata  masimo and nellcor had and respectively of the us pulse oximetry monitoring equipment market 
we believe we will continue to grow our us market share amount as more hospitals convert to masimo technology 
new market opportunities for masimo set general floor monitoring expansion we believe there are opportunities to expand the market for pulse oximetry by applying masimo set s proven benefits from critical care settings to non critical care settings  as well as settings outside of the hospital 
it is currently estimated that over of all us 
table of contents hospital beds are located in non critical care areas  where continuous monitoring is not widely used 
a study published in july  by healthgrades showed that approximately  hospital deaths over a three year period were attributable to patient safety incidents  or generally preventable patient events in non critical care areas 
the study concluded that the failure to timely diagnose and treat patients accounted for over of those deaths  suggesting that improved patient monitoring in non critical care settings can alert clinicians of patient distress and help to improve patient care 
as presented at the society for technology in anesthesia in  a recent study by dartmouth hitchcock medical center demonstrated a measurable cost advantage with patient safetynet s ability to assist clinicians in the identification of the onset of patient distress earlier  contributing to decreases in patient costs on the general care floor 
the american hospital association estimated that there were approximately  staffed beds in all us registered hospitals in in  approximately of all hospital beds in the united states were located in non critical care settings according to a study published in the journal of critical care medicine  which suggests a non critical care market potential of approximately  beds in the us alone 
while some of these non critical care beds have some form of monitoring capabilities today  we believe that approximately of the  beds in the us alone could become continuous monitoring beds 
we believe that masimo set s ability to dramatically minimize false alarms due to patient motion while maximizing the sensitivity of pulse oximeters to report true alarms will allow hospitals to reliably and continuously monitor their patients in the general floors 
alternate care according to the june frost sullivan report  the fastest growing portion of the us pulse oximetry equipment market is in the alternate care market 
we believe that masimo set technology offers significant advantages in some segments of this market  including home care and sleep diagnostics 
the proven ability of masimo set to dramatically reduce false alarms and increase true event detection enables clinicians to make more reliable diagnoses of those who need oxygen therapy and continuous positive airway pressure  or cpap  and we plan to leverage the opportunity and expand our presence in this market 
new market opportunities for masimo rainbow set there are opportunities to expand the market for patient monitoring by enabling the measurement of additional blood constituents beyond arterial blood oxygen saturation level and pulse rate by measuring total hemoglobin  carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin 
total hemoglobin sphb in may  we received clearance from the fda for our total hemoglobin monitoring technology and in september  we began shipping  in a limited market release  these monitors and sensors 
hemoglobin is the part of a red blood cell that carries oxygen to the body and therefore a measurement of total hemoglobin is an indicator of the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood 
because of its clinical importance  hemoglobin is one of the most commonly ordered lab diagnostic tests in the hospital and physician office 
each year in the united states  over million invasive hemoglobin tests are performed  which require multiple steps including collecting the patient s blood sample  and most often transferring the sample to the lab  analyzing the sample and documenting the results and reporting the results to the ordering clinician 
according to a study published in surgery  unnecessary blood transfusions in a surgical setting account for between of all transfusion costs 
bleeding during surgery may require a blood transfusion  which increases the length of hospital stays and the associated healthcare costs 
the decision to transfuse often requires the physician to either make an educated guess or wait for lab results to confirm that it is necessary 
our rainbow set technology can provide noninvasive and continuous hemoglobin measurements to the clinician  typically within seconds after placing our rainbow sensor on a patient s finger 
we believe that the ability to measure total hemoglobin on a noninvasive  immediate and continuous basis will  enable clinicians in surgery  icu  emergency department  and other hospital settings to make earlier and better treatment decisions  including the detection of bleeding earlier and the decision of whether or not to transfuse  thus potentially decreasing costs 
because of the significant clinical and cost advantages of measuring total hemoglobin noninvasively and continuously  we believe that a large number of hospitals will adopt masimo rainbow set technology because of our total hemoglobin measurement 
a significant portion of invasive hemoglobin measurements are made outside of hospital settings  in the physician office to aid diagnosis and treatment  and in the blood donation market to qualify potential donors for eligibility to donate blood 
we believe that a significant number of the estimated  us physician offices and estimated million annual us blood donations would be aided by the noninvasive and immediate assessment of hemoglobin 
while we believe that these market opportunities will eventually become significant  we do not expect any expansion into these specific markets until carboxyhemoglobin spco carbon monoxide is a colorless  odorless and tasteless gas that is undetectable by humans and is often unknowingly inhaled from combustion fumes  or during fires by victims and first responders 
carbon monoxide poisoning is the leading cause of accidental 
table of contents poisoning death in the us  responsible for up to  emergency department visits and unintentional deaths annually 
carbon monoxide poisoning  which involves carbon monoxide binding with hemoglobin cells  thereby preventing them from carrying oxygen  can cause severe neurological damage  permanent heart damage or death in a matter of minutes 
quick diagnosis and treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning is critical in saving lives and preventing long term damage  but the condition is often misdiagnosed because symptoms are similar to the flu 
masimo s ability to noninvasively detect carbon monoxide has allowed clinicians and emergency professionals to identify carbon monoxide poisoning earlier  allowing faster triage and earlier intervention and treatment 
a recent study in the emergency department using masimo rainbow set carbon monoxide monitoring identified more carbon monoxide poisoning cases than the conventional approach  and estimated that as many as  carbon monoxide poisoning cases per year in the us were being missed with the conventional approach 
several leading emergency first responder associations  including the national association of emergency medical technicians  the national association of ems educators and the international association of fire fighters  have in the past months issued recommendations to noninvasively screen for carbon monoxide poisoning when exposure is suspected or when an individual presents with symptoms of such poisoning 
in addition the national fire protection association  or nfpa  included carbon monoxide screening by pulse co oximetry as part of a new national healthcare standard for firefighters potentially exposed to carbon monoxide poisoning 
nfpa s consensus codes and standards serve as the worldwide authoritative source on fire prevention and public safety 
in addition  the united kingdom house of commons all party parliamentary gas safety group  in a newly published report aimed at increasing the awareness of carbon monoxide poisoning among medical professionals  and recommends noninvasive carbon monoxide testing for emergency department and ems providers as a way to improve the country s rate of detection and diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning 
for the preparation of this report  the united kingdom group used masimo rainbow set rad devices for months and reported successful cases with the rad devices 
in the us  medicare recently approved a current procedural terminology  or cpt  code and pricing for carboxyhemoglobin  enabling hospitals that perform testing to recoup their costs  in addition to the clinical benefits they receive 
we believe that the first opportunity for noninvasive blood carbon monoxide monitoring is in the ems and emergency department settings 
in the us alone  there are approximately  fire departments ems locations and  hospitals that would benefit from noninvasive carbon monoxide testing 
we believe other opportunities exist for carboxyhemoglobin monitoring  including the pre operative setting 
methemoglobin spmet commonly prescribed drugs can introduce methemoglobin into the blood and cause methemoglobinemia 
some of the drugs that are known to cause methemoglobinemia are benzocaine  a local anesthetic  which is routinely used in procedures ranging from endoscopy to surgery  inhaled nitric oxide  routinely used in the neonatal intensive care unit  nitroglycerin used to treat cardiac patients and dapsone  used to treat infections for immune deficient patients  such as hiv patients 
methemoglobinemia reduces the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin for delivery to tissues and forces normal hemoglobin to bind more tightly to oxygen  releasing less oxygen to the tissues 
methemoglobinemia is often unrecognized or diagnosed late  increasing risk to the patient 
according to a study published by researchers at johns hopkins university in september  there were cases  or of all patients reviewed  of acquired methemoglobinemia  at two hospitals over a month period 
the methemoglobinemia resulted in one fatality and three near fatalities 
warnings  cautions and alerts regarding the clinical significance and prevalence of methemoglobinemia have been generated by the fda  veterans administration  institute for safe medication practices  and the national academy of clinical biochemistry 
the american academy of pediatrics recommends monitoring methemoglobin levels in infants who receive nitric oxide therapy 
in the us  medicare recently approved a cpt code and pricing for our methemoglobin monitoring  enabling hospitals who perform testing to recoup their costs  in addition to the clinical benefits they receive 
we believe the initial opportunity for methemoglobin monitoring is in outpatient procedure labs in hospitals  such as esophageal echocardiography and gastrointestinal labs where use of caines  such as benzocaine  is prevalent  monitoring hiv patients who receive dapsone  as well as monitoring neonates who receive inspired nitric oxide in the neonatal intensive care units 
plethysmograph variability index pvi plethysmograph variability index  or pvi  is a noninvasive measurement that quantifies changes in the plethysmographic waveform over the respiration cycle 
pvi may help optimize fluid status  a critical factor during surgery and in intensive care 
traditional methods such as invasive pressure monitoring often fail to predict fluid responsiveness  and newer methods are also invasive and costly 
pvi has been shown by one research group to predict fluid responsiveness in surgical and intensive care patients 
optimizing fluid status has been shown to improve patient outcomes in previously published studies  so we believe that pvi will be helpful in patient management as well 
we believe the primary opportunity for pvi monitoring is in surgery and intensive care in hospitals  but it is also possible that future studies may reveal application in identifying dehydration or in optimizing fluid in cardiac conditions such as heart failure 

table of contents future parameters we believe that our core signal processing and sensor technologies are widely applicable and expect to develop and launch future applications utilizing our proprietary technology platforms 
in the second half of  we expect to introduce  in limited market release  a noninvasive and continuous respiration rate parameter based on acoustic monitoring set 
respiration rate is defined as the number of breaths per minute  and changes in respiration rate provide an early warning sign of deterioration in patient condition 
current methods to monitor respiration rate include end tidal co monitoring  which requires a special tube inserted in the patient s nose  and impedance monitoring  which is considered cumbersome to the clinician and patient and unreliable 
masimo s noninvasive respiration rate parameter will be available in our masimo rainbow set platforms such as radical and rad bedside monitoring devices  with the launch of mx board  slated for release in the second half of fiscal these devices will be deployed through an acoustic respiration sensor on the patient s neck and connected to the bedside monitor with a special cable 
should the respiration rate change or stop  an alarm will be displayed on the device and in addition  can be sent to the masimo patent safetynet system  which can notify the attending clinician or nurse of the condition  directly on the monitor or remotely via a pager 
we believe this noninvasive measurement will become a key and important measurement in both critical care and general floor environments 
the masimo solution our innovative and proprietary technologies and products are designed to overcome the primary limitations of conventional pulse oximetry  which involve maintaining accuracy in the presence of motion artifact and weak signal to noise situations 
our masimo set platform  which became available to hospitals in the united states in  is the basis of our pulse oximetry products and we believe represented the first significant technological advancement in pulse oximetry since its introduction in the early s 
in addition  our products benefits have been validated in over independent clinical and laboratory studies 
masimo set utilizes five signal processing algorithms  four of which are proprietary  in parallel  to deliver high precision  sensitivity and specificity in the measurement of arterial blood oxygen saturation levels 
sensitivity is the ability to detect true events and specificity is the ability to reject false alarms 
one of our proprietary processing algorithms  discrete saturation transform  separates signal from noise in real time through the use of adaptive filtering  and an iterative sampling technique that tests each possible saturation value for validity 
masimo set signal processing can therefore identify the venous blood and other noise  isolate them  and extract the arterial signal 
to complement our masimo set platform  we have developed a wide range of proprietary single patient use and reusable sensors  cables and other accessories designed specifically to work with masimo set software and hardware 
although our technology platforms operate solely with our proprietary sensor lines  our sensors have the capability to work with certain competitive pulse oximetry monitors through the use of adapter cables 
our neonatal adhesive sensors have been clinically proven to exhibit greater durability compared to competitive sensors 
in  we introduced our masimo rainbow set platform  leveraging our masimo set technology and incorporating licensed rainbow technology to enable reliable  real time monitoring of additional parameters beyond arterial blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate 
the masimo rainbow set platform has the unique ability to distinguish oxygenated hemoglobins from certain dyshemoglobins  hemoglobin incapable of transporting oxygen  and allows for the rapid  noninvasive monitoring of total hemoglobin  carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin and pvi  which we refer to as pulse co oximetry 
along with the release of our rainbow set pulse co oximetry products  we have developed multi wavelength sensors that have the ability to monitor multiple parameters with a single sensor 
we believe that the use of masimo rainbow set pulse co oximetry products will become widely adopted for the noninvasive monitoring of these parameters 
additionally  we market our patient safetynet and radnet remote alarm and monitoring systems for use with our masimo set pulse oximeters and rainbow set pulse co oximeters 
these systems currently allow wireless and remote monitoring of the oxygen saturation and pulse rate of up to patients simultaneously  and may facilitate the expansion of our products into areas beyond the critical care settings  such as the general care areas 
we believe that the superior performance of the masimo set platform coupled with reliable  cost effective  and easy to use wireless remote monitoring will allow hospitals to create continuous surveillance solutions on general care floors where patients are at risk of avoidable adverse events and where direct patient observation by skilled clinicians is cost prohibitive 
benefits of our products and technology we believe that our technology and products offer several key benefits  including accurate  real time measurement 
we believe that the masimo set platform has the ability to provide more accurate measurements with fewer missed events and false alarms than other pulse oximeters in the market place 
many of the top hospitals in the united states  including four of the top five  according to us news and world reports honor roll for 
table of contents  made masimo set their primary pulse oximetry platform 
we believe masimo rainbow set will allow noninvasive measurement of previously invasive parameters  such as total hemoglobin 
increased quality of patient care 
we believe that the proven accuracy and reliability of masimo set pulse oximetry allows for better clinical decisions  leading to fewer medical errors and better patient care 
we believe that the noninvasive monitoring of carboxyhemoglobin will improve the quality of care based on the number of emergency room visits reported for carbon monoxide poisoning 
we believe the noninvasive monitoring of methemoglobin will also improve patient care based on reported drug interactions that increase methemoglobin levels in the blood 
we believe wireless remote alarm and monitoring on the general care floor will reduce avoidable adverse events through earlier detection and intervention 
we believe masimo rainbow set will allow earlier and better clinical decisions in a variety of care areas 
reduced cost of care 
several independent studies have shown that hospitals can reduce their costs as a result of using masimo set products 
we believe that factors contributing to lower costs include a reduction in sensor usage as a result of more durable sensors  fewer invasive arterial blood gas procedures needed  less oxygen administration and a reduction in length of stay as the result of weaning patients off of ventilators more quickly 
in addition  we expect that the noninvasive monitoring of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin will help reduce the cost of care by reducing the need for invasive blood tests and limiting the costs from complications caused by incorrect diagnoses 
we believe early detection of avoidable adverse events will contribute to lower length of stay because such events will be treated earlier before patients decompensate to critical levels 
we believe earlier and better clinical decisions from masimo rainbow set will allow for more cost effective care and in some cases reimbursable procedures for hospitals and non hospital providers 
masimo set platform allows for expansion into non critical care settings 
we believe the ability of masimo set products to provide reliable monitoring with fewer false alarms has expanded and will continue to expand the use of pulse oximetry into other settings where patient motion and false alarms have historically prevented its use 
since the introduction of masimo set  we believe that pulse oximetry has become a standard of care in the ems market 
in addition  hospitals and other care centers can reduce their costs by moving less critically ill patients from the icu to the general care areas where these patients can be continuously and accurately monitored in a more cost effective manner 
many patients in the general care areas are at risk of dying due to inadequate oxygenation 
to mitigate this risk  patients in the general care areas need to be continuously monitored 
our patient safetynet and radnet systems enable the masimo set and rainbow set platforms to wirelessly and remotely monitor patients in the general care areas of the hospital that are not under the constant supervision of clinicians 
upgradeable rainbow platform for the monitoring of additional parameters 
products with our new mx circuit board contain our masimo set pulse oximetry technology as well as circuitry to support rainbow parameters 
at the time of purchase  or at any time in the future  our customers and our oems customers will have the option of purchasing a software parameter  which will allow the customer to expand their patient monitoring systems to monitor additional parameters with a cost effective solution 
our strategy since inception  our mission has been to develop noninvasive blood constituent patient monitoring solutions that improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of patient care 
we intend to continue to grow our business and to improve our market position by pursuing the following strategies continue to expand our market share in pulse oximetry 
we grew our product revenue from million in to million in  representing a three year cagr of approximately 
this growth can be attributed to the increased access to pulse oximetry customers through our agreements with group purchasing organizations  or gpos  and our increased relationships with oem partners  the expansion of our direct sales force  and strong  independent clinical evidence that demonstrates the benefits of our technology 
we supplement our direct sales with sales through our distributors 
direct and distributor sales increased to approximately million  or  of product revenue in  from million  or  of product revenue in expand the pulse oximetry market to other patient care settings 
we believe the ability to continuously and accurately monitor patients outside of critical care settings  including the general care areas of the hospital  are currently unmet medical needs and have the potential to significantly improve patient care and increase the size of the pulse oximetry market 
we believe the ability of masimo set to accurately monitor and address the limitations of conventional pulse oximetry has enabled  and will continue to enable  us to expand into non critical care settings and thus significantly expand the market for our products 
to further support our expansion into the general care areas  we market two wireless floor monitoring solutions  patient safetynet and radnet  that currently enable continuous monitoring of up to patients oxygen saturation and pulse rate with one system  utilizing our masimo set or masimo rainbow set platform 

table of contents expand the use of rainbow set pulse co oximetry in the hospital setting 
we believe the noninvasive measurement of total hemoglobin  carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin  pvi  and future parameters will provide an excellent opportunity to leverage existing customer relationships into new streams of revenue  directly and through a greater ability to convert non masimo hospitals to masimo hospitals due to our expanded measurement capabilities 
expand the use of rainbow set in the non hospital setting 
we believe the noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin creates a significant opportunity in markets such as the physician office and blood donation centers  and noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin in the fire ems market 
by  we expect to introduce a new handheld product called the pronto into the physician office 
the pronto will allow non hospital users to simply and quickly measure hemoglobin  one of the most common invasive laboratory measurements 
we believe that the ability to noninvasively measure total hemoglobin will greatly facilitate the efficiency with which physicians will be able to quickly determine total hemoglobin levels of their patients  by reducing invasive blood draws  labeling  sending to the lab  waiting for the lab results  and communicating these results to the patient usually the next day 
utilize our customer base and oem relationships to market our masimo rainbow set pulse co oximetry products incorporating licensed rainbow technology 
we sold our first masimo rainbow set pulse co oximetry products in september we are currently selling our rainbow set products through our direct sales force and distributors 
in addition  we plan to sell our mx circuit boards in our own pulse oximeters and to our oem partners  equipped with circuitry to support rainbow set pulse co oximetry parameters which can be activated at time of sale or through a subsequent software upgrade 
we believe that the clinical need of these measurements along with our installed customer base will help drive the adoption of our rainbow set pulse co oximetry products 
continue to innovate and maintain our technology leadership position 
we invented and pioneered what we believe is the first pulse oximeter to accurately measure arterial blood oxygen saturation level and pulse rate in the presence of motion artifact and low perfusion 
in addition  through our license of rainbow technology from masimo labs  we launched our rainbow set pulse co oximetry platform that enabled what we believe are the first fda cleared noninvasive monitoring of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin in the blood 
we also developed pvi 
we plan to continue to innovate and develop new technologies and products internally and through our collaboration with masimo labs  for the noninvasive monitoring of other parameters 
our future growth strategy is also closely tied to our focus on international expansion opportunities 
historically  we have generated between to of our revenues in the united states 
since  we have been aggressively expanding our sales and marketing presence in europe  japan  canada  latin america and the rest of asia 
we have accomplished this through both additional staffing and by adding or expanding sales offices in many of these territories 
during the fourth quarter of  we established a new international business structure designed to better serve and support our growing international business 
by centralizing our international operations  including sales management  marketing  customer support  planning  logistics and administrative functions  we believe it will be able to develop a more efficient and scalable international organization capable of being even more responsive to the business needs of its international customers all under one centralized management structure 
as a result of these investments and focus on our international operations  we believe that our international product revenues  as a percent of total product revenues  will continue to increase 
our products we develop  manufacture and market a patient monitoring solution that incorporates a monitor or circuit board and sensors including both proprietary single patient use and reusable sensors and cables 
in addition  we offer remote alarm monitoring solutions and software

our masimo set ms circuit boards perform all signal processing and other pulse oximetry functions incorporating the masimo set platform 
our ms circuit boards are included in our proprietary monitors for direct sale or sold to our oem partners for incorporation into their monitors 
once incorporated into a pulse oximeter  the ms circuit boards perform all data acquisition processing and report the pulse oximetry levels to the host monitor 
the circuit boards and related software interface directly with our proprietary sensors to calculate arterial blood oxygen saturation level and pulse rate 
our latest generation boards include the ms  ms and ms our older generation boards  including the ms  ms  ms  ms  ms and ms circuit boards  which all vary in size and power consumption  have been made obsolete and are being transitioned out of our ms oem board family 
masimo rainbow set mx circuit boards 
our next generation circuit board is the foundation for our masimo rainbow set pulse co oximetry platform  utilizing technology licensed from masimo labs 
the mx circuit boards measure arterial blood oxygen saturation levels and pulse rate  and have the circuitry to enable the measurement of total hemoglobin  oxygen content  carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin  pvi and potentially other parameters 
customers can choose to buy additional parameters beyond arterial blood oxygen saturation levels and pulse rate at the time of sale or at any time in the future through a field installed software upgrade 
as additional parameters are developed  each new parameter may be available as a software upgrade to the existing system 
pulse co oximeters monitors and pulse oximeters radical we believe that the radical pulse co oximeter is the most advanced and versatile oximetry monitor available 
the radical incorporates the mx circuit board  which enables all rainbow set parameters  and offers three in one capability to be used as a standalone device for bedside monitoring  a detachable  battery operated handheld unit for easy portable monitoring  and a monitor interface via satshare  proprietary technology allowing our products to work with certain competitor products  to upgrade existing conventional multi parameter patient monitors to masimo set while displaying rainbow parameters on the radical itself 
radical is a fully equipped standalone pulse co oximeter with a detachable module  which functions as a battery operated  handheld monitor 
the handheld module can be connected with any other radical base station  which allows radical to stay with the patient  enabling continuous and reliable arterial blood oxygen saturation and blood constituent monitoring such as total hemoglobin as patients are transported within the hospital 
for example  radical can continuously monitor a patient from the ambulatory environment  to the emergency room  to the operating room  to the general floor  and on until the patient is discharged 
radical delivers the accuracy and reliability of masimo rainbow set with multi functionality  ease of use and a convenient upgrade path for existing monitors 
our satshare technology enables a conventional monitor to upgrade to masimo set through a simple cable connection from the back of radical to the sensor input port of the conventional monitor 
no software upgrades or new modules are necessary for the upgrade  
table of contents which can be completed in minutes 
satshare allows hospitals to standardize the technology and sensors used throughout the hospital while allowing them to gain more accurate monitoring capabilities and additional multi functionality in a cost effective manner 
this has facilitated many hospital wide conversions of previously installed competitor monitors to masimo set 
in addition  masimo rainbow set parameters such as total hemoglobin are available to clinicians on the radical itself while the device is being used in satshare mode 
rad the rad  which also contains masimo rainbow set technology  is a compact  lightweight and easy to use device designed specifically for use in less acute settings than the radical the rad is available with a built in bi directional wireless radio for use as part of the masimo patient safetynet remote monitoring and clinician notification system 
we began shipping the rad in july pronto 
the pronto is a handheld spot check device  using masimo rainbow set technology  specifically designed to noninvasively provide total hemoglobin levels in a physician office  clinic  or blood donation setting 
additionally  the device provides arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate readings 
the pronto does not provide continuous monitoring 
we received fda clearance for the pronto in december and expect to begin shipping the product  under a limited market release program  in the first half of rad the rad is a bedside pulse oximeter featuring masimo set but without rainbow capability with a low cost design and streamlined feature set  allowing it to be offered at a lower price point than the radical or rad rad in addition to the bedside monitors  we have developed handheld pulse oximeters using masimo set 
our rad and rad v handheld oximeters were the first dedicated handhelds with masimo set 
rad the rad is a fully featured handheld pulse co oximeter that provides continuous  noninvasive measurement of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin in addition to oxygen saturation  pulse rate  perfusion and index 
its rugged and lightweight design makes it applicable for use in hospital and field settings  specifically for fire departments and ems units 
sensors sensors and cables 
we have developed one of the broadest lines of single patient use and reusable sensors and cables 
masimo set sensors are uniquely designed to reduce interference from physiological and non physiological noise 
our proprietary technology platforms operate only with our proprietary sensor lines 
however  through the use of adapter cables  we can connect our sensors to certain competitive pulse oximetry monitors 
we sell our sensors and cables to end users through our direct sales force and our distributors and oem partners 
our single patient use sensors offer several advantages over reusable sensors  including improved performance  cleanliness  increased comfort and greater reliability 
in addition  our lnop single patient use sensors offer several advantages over competitive disposable sensors  including a more durable tape material that is less likely to tear and an adhesive that can be easily rejuvenated with an alcohol swab 
as a result  the sensor can be moved and reapplied multiple times during a patient s stay 
our lnop single patient neonatal adhesive sensors have been shown in independent  published studies to last approximately twice as long as the market leading disposable sensor 
our reusable sensors  which include ear and forehead sensors  are primarily used for short term hospital stays and spot checks 
we currently sell over different sensors for adults  children  infants and pre term infants 
softouch sensors 
we have developed softouch sensors  designed with less adhesive or no adhesive at all for compromised skin conditions 
these include single patient sensors for babies and multi site reusable sensors for pediatrics and adults 
trauma and newborn sensors 
we believe we were the first to develop two specialty sensor lines  specifically designed for trauma and resuscitation situations  as well as for newborns 
these sensors contain an identifier which automatically sets the oximeter to monitor with maximum sensitivity and the shortest averaging mode and allows for quick application  even in wet and slippery environments 
blue sensors 
in  we introduced what we believe to be the first fda cleared sensor to accurately monitor arterial blood oxygen saturation levels in cyanotic infants and children with abnormally low oxygen saturation levels 
masimo rainbow set sensors 
we believe we were the first to develop proprietary  multi wavelength sensors for use with our rainbow set pulse co oximetry products 
as opposed to traditional sensors that only have the capability to monitor arterial blood oxygen saturation levels and pulse rate  our rainbow sensors can also monitor carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin and total hemoglobin 
our licensed rainbow set sensors are the only sensors that are compatible with our licensed rainbow set products 
remote alarm and monitoring solutions patient safetynet 
patient safetynet is a remote monitoring and clinician notification system 
it instantly routes bedside generated alarms through a server to a qualified clinician s handheld paging device in real time 
each system can support up to bedside monitors and can either be integrated into a hospital s existing it infrastructure or operate as a stand alone wireless network 

table of contents radnet 
radnet enables masimo set and rainbow set monitors with a wired or wireless monitoring system to provide continuous  centralized monitoring of remotely located patients  with the ability to monitor up to patients per system 
ppo 
ppo  or personal pulse oximeter  is a patient wearable pulse oximeter and electrocardiogram  or ecg  monitor that can wirelessly transmit patients arterial blood oxygen saturation level  pulse rate and ecg to the radnet 
ppo is ideally suited for monitoring ambulatory patients in the general care areas  emergency department  emergency department waiting room and any other area where the patient is ambulatory 
both radnet and ppo are oem products from welch allyn 
software 
all of our monitors  including radical and certain future oem products  which incorporate the mx board  will allow purchases of software for rainbow parameters as well as other future parameters or features that can be field installed 
geographic information we are a global company with a geographically diverse market presence 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial information relating to the geographic areas in which we currently engage in business 
sales and marketing as of january   we had employees in sales and marketing in the united states and abroad  including sales representatives 
we expect to continue to increase our worldwide sales and sales support organizations as we continue to expand our presence throughout both the united states and throughout the world including europe  the middle east  japan  asia  latin america  canada and australia 
we currently sell all of our products both directly to hospitals and the ems market via our sales force  and certain distributors 
our direct and distributor revenue accounted for approximately of our total product revenue in the primary focus of our sales representatives is to facilitate the conversion of competitor accounts to our masimo set pulse oximetry products 
in addition to sales representatives  we employ clinical specialists to work with our sales representatives to educate end users on the benefits of masimo set and assist with the introduction and implementation of our technology and products to their sites 
our sales and marketing strategy for pulse oximetry has been and will continue to be focused on building end user awareness of the clinical and cost saving benefits of our masimo set platform 
more recently  we have expanded this communication and educational role to include our masimo rainbow set pulse co oximetry products  including total hemoglobin  carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin and pvi 
for the year ended january   owens minor  one of our distributors  represented of our total revenue and was the only customer that represented or more of our revenue for the year ended january  importantly  distributors such as owens minor take and fulfill orders from our direct customers  many of whom have signed long term sensor agreements with us 
as a result  in the event a specific distributor is unable to fulfill these orders  the orders will be redirected to other distributors or fulfilled directly by us 
additionally  we sell certain of our products through our oem partners who both incorporate our boards into their monitors and resell our sensors to their customers installed base of masimo set products 
our oem agreements allow us to expand the availability of masimo set through the sales and distribution channels of each oem partner 
to facilitate clinician awareness of masimo set installations  all of our oem partners have agreed to place the masimo set logo prominently on their instruments 
as of january   we had agreements with oem partners whom we believe accounted for over of worldwide shipments of pulse oximeters incorporated into multi parameter monitors 
as of january   our oem partners had collectively launched a total of approximately patient monitoring products worldwide incorporating masimo set 
in order to facilitate our direct sales to hospitals  we have signed contracts with companies that we believe to be the six largest gpos  based on the total volume of negotiated purchases 
in return for the gpos to put our products on contract  we have agreed to pay the gpos a percentage of our revenue from their member hospitals 
in and  revenue from the sale of our pulse oximetry products to hospitals that are associated with gpos amounted to million and million  respectively 
our marketing efforts are designed to build end user awareness through advertising  direct mail and trade shows 
in addition  we distribute published clinical studies  sponsor accredited educational seminars for doctors  nurses  biomedical engineers  and respiratory therapists and conduct clinical evaluations 
we expect to increase the size of our sales and marketing force worldwide during  as we continue to establish and expand our sales channels on a global basis 

table of contents competition the medical device industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
while we regard any company that sells pulse oximeters as a potential customer  we also recognize that the companies selling pulse oximeters on an oem basis and or pulse oximetry sensors are also potential competitors 
our primary competitor  covidien ltd 
formerly tyco healthcare and its subsidiary nellcor puritan bennett  inc  currently hold a substantial share of the pulse oximetry market 
covidien sells its own brand of nellcor pulse oximeters to end users  sells pulse oximetry modules to other monitoring companies on an oem basis and licenses  to certain oems  the right to make their pulse oximetry platforms compatible with nellcor sensors 
although nellcor is still a competitor of ours  in we settled a patent infringement case against them following an appellate ruling which found that nellcor had infringed three of our patents 
see nellcor patent litigation settlement in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we face substantial competition from larger medical device companies  including companies that develop products that compete with our proprietary masimo set 
we believe that a number of companies have announced products which claim to offer measure through motion accuracy 
based on those announcements and our investigations  we further believe that many of these products include technology that infringes our intellectual property rights 
we have settled claims against some of these companies and intend to vigorously enforce and protect our proprietary rights with respect to the others whom we believe are infringing our technology 
on february   we filed a patent infringement suit against phillips electronics north america corporation and philips medizin systeme b blingen gmbh  which are affiliates of philips medical systems  one of our oem partners 
some of the remaining companies  including ge medical systems and mindray medical international ltd  are also currently oem partners of ours 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market for pulse oximetry products include accurate monitoring during both patient motion and low perfusion  ability to introduce other clinically beneficial parameters related to oxygenation and respiration  such as carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin  competitive pricing  sales and marketing capability  access to hospitals which are members of gpos  access to oem partners  and patent protection

these licenses are exclusive until the later of years from the grant of the applicable license or the expiration of the last patent included in the rainbow technology related to the applicable parameter 
the masimo market is defined as those product markets where the product is intended to be used by a professional medical caregiver  including hospital caregivers  surgicenter caregivers  paramedic vehicle caregivers  doctor s offices caregivers  ems facility caregivers and vehicles where emergency medical services are provided 
our license to rainbow technology for these parameters in these markets is exclusive on the condition that we continue to pay masimo labs royalties on our products incorporating rainbow technology  subject to certain minimum unit and aggregate royalty thresholds  and that we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or market products incorporating the licensed rainbow technology 
the royalty is up to of the rainbow royalty base  which includes handhelds  tabletop and multi parameter devices 
handheld products incorporating rainbow technology will carry a royalty rate 
for other products  only the proportional amount attributable for that portion of our products used to measure non vital signs parameters  sensors and accessories  rather than for measuring vital signs parameters  will be included in the rainbow royalty base 
for multi parameter devices  the rainbow royalty base will include the percentage of the revenue based on the number of rainbow enabled parameters 
beginning in  for hospital contracts where we place equipment and enter into a sensor contract  we will pay a royalty to masimo labs on the total sensor contract revenue based on the ratio of rainbow enabled devices to total devices 
we are also subject to certain specific annual minimum aggregate royalty payments 
the minimum aggregate royalty payment is million for the fiscal year and million per year thereafter 
from its inception in through january   we have agreed to pay masimo labs million for both exclusive options and minimum royalty payments 
we have days after proof of feasibility to exercise the above referenced option to obtain a license to the remaining non vital signs parameters  including carbon monoxide  methemoglobin  total hemoglobin and bilirubin  for an additional  each  and blood glucose  for an additional million

any new non vital signs monitoring technology utilizing masimo set that we develop will be owned by masimo labs and will be subject to the same license and option fees as if it had been developed by masimo labs 
also  we will not be reimbursed by masimo labs for our expenses relating to the development of any such technology 
masimo labs services agreement 
we have also entered into a services agreement  or the services agreement  with masimo labs 
under this services agreement  we provide masimo labs with engineering services and accordingly charge masimo labs for these direct salary and payroll related expenses 
in addition  at the end of each quarter  we charge masimo labs for its share of accounting  human resources  legal  facility and equipment costs  which we collectively refer to as indirect expenses 
from its inception in through january   masimo labs has incurred approximately million in both direct and indirect expenses 
we expect masimo labs to continue to engage us for these services 
however  pursuant to the services agreement  masimo labs may terminate the agreement by providing us days notice  while we may terminate with days notice to masimo labs 
research and product development we believe that ongoing research and development efforts are essential to our success 
as of january   including masimo labs  we employed engineers and engineering support staff 
we expect to increase the size of our research and development staff during our research and development efforts focus primarily on continuing to enhance our technical expertise in pulse oximetry  enabling the noninvasive monitoring of other parameters and developing remote alarm and monitoring solutions 
although we and masimo labs each have separate research and development projects  we collaborate with masimo labs on multiple research and development activities related to rainbow technology and other technologies 
under the cross licensing agreement  the parties have agreed to allocate proprietary ownership of technology developed by either party based on the functionality of the technology 
we will have proprietary rights to all technology related to the noninvasive measurement of vital signs parameters  and masimo labs will have proprietary ownership of all technology related to the noninvasive measurement of non vital signs parameters 
in addition  under our services agreement with masimo labs  we provide masimo labs with professional and management support services  including human resources  legal and accounting services 
in january  masimo labs realigned its development efforts and  as of january   it had nine full time engineers supporting its development efforts 
our total research and development expenditures for were million  which included million related to expenses incurred by masimo labs pursuant to the cross licensing agreement

in  our total research and development expenditures were million  which included million of share based payment expense  and million related to expenses incurred by masimo labs pursuant to the cross licensing agreement 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in and beyond as we expand our research and development force  enhance our existing products and technologies and develop new ones 
intellectual property we believe that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace  we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property 
we have developed a patent portfolio internally  and to a lesser extent through acquisitions and licensing  that covers many aspects of our product offerings 
as of january   we had issued patents and pending applications in the united states  europe  japan  australia  canada and other countries throughout the world 
in addition  as of january   technology we licensed from our development partner  masimo labs  was supported by issued patents and pending applications in the united states and internationally 
some of our earliest patents begin to expire in some of masimo labs earliest patents begin to expire in additionally  as of january   we owned us registered trademarks and foreign registered trademarks  as well as trade names that we use in conjunction with the sale of our products 
under the cross licensing agreement  we and masimo labs have agreed to allocate proprietary ownership of technology developed based on the functionality of the technology 
we will have proprietary ownership  including ownership of all patents  copyrights and trade secrets  of all technology related to the noninvasive measurement of vital signs parameters  and masimo labs will have proprietary ownership of all technology related to the noninvasive measurement of non vital signs parameters 
we also rely upon trade secrets  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how  in part  with confidentiality agreements with consultants  vendors and employees  although we cannot be certain that the agreements will not be breached  or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach 

table of contents there are risks related to our intellectual property rights 
for further detail on these risks  see item a risk factors 
government regulation fda s premarket clearance and approval requirements unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the united states must first receive either k clearance  by filing a k pre market notification  or pma approval  by filing a pma application  from the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months  but it can take longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
it generally takes from one to three years or even longer 
we cannot be sure that k clearance or pma approval will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market 
the fda decides whether a device must undergo either the k clearance or pma approval process based upon statutory criteria 
these criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed 
devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either class i or ii  which requires the manufacturer to submit a pre market notification requesting k clearance  unless an exemption applies 
class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fda s general regulatory controls for medical devices  which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  facility registration and product listing  reporting of adverse medical events  and appropriate  truthful and non misleading labeling  advertising  and promotional materials general controls 
some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the k premarket notification process 
class ii devices are subject to the fda s general controls  and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device 
premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the k premarket notification procedure 
all of our current devices are class ii devices 
class iii devices are those devices which have a new intended use  or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device 
the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above 
these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below 
premarket approval applications and supplemental premarket approval applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under medical device user fee and modernization act of  or mdufma  than are k premarket notifications 
to obtain k clearance  a company must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in technological and performance characteristics to a legally marketed predicate device that is either in class i  class ii  or is a class iii device that was in commercial distribution before may   for which the fda has not yet called for submission of a pma application 
pursuant to the mdufma and the mdufma ii provisions of the food and drug amendments act of  unless a specific exemption applies  k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees 
after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or could require a pma approval 
the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any decision 
if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer s decision not to seek a new k clearance  the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek k clearance or pma approval 
the fda also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until k clearance or pma approval is obtained 
we have modified some of our k cleared devices  including our masimo set software and radical  but have determined that  in our view  based on fda guidance as to when to submit a k notification for changes to a cleared device  new k clearances or pma approvals are not required 
we cannot assure you that the fda would agree with any of our decisions not to seek k clearance or pma approval 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or pma approval for any modification  we also may be required to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until we obtain a new k clearance or pma approval 
devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk  such as life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  or deemed not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device  are placed in class iii 
these devices are required to undergo the pma approval process in which the manufacturer must establish the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda s satisfaction 
a pma application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data and also information about the device and its components regarding  among other things  device design  manufacturing and labeling 
also during the review period  an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device 
in addition  the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the qsr 
new premarket approval  or pma  applications or pma application supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device  including  for example  certain types of modifications to the device s indication for use  manufacturing process  labeling and design 
pma supplements often require submission of the same type of 
table of contents information as a pma application  except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application  and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 
none of our products are currently approved under a pma 
a clinical trial may be required in support of a k submission and generally is required for a pma application 
these trials generally require an investigational device exemption  or ide  application approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients  unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device eligible for more abbreviated ide requirements 
the ide application must be supported by appropriate data  such as animal and laboratory testing results 
clinical trials may begin if the ide application is approved by the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites 
even if a trial is completed  the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain fda approval to market the product in the us we believe that our oem partners may be required to obtain k premarket clearance from the fda for products that incorporate masimo set or masimo rainbow set circuit boards and sensors 
in order to facilitate our oem partners in obtaining k clearance for their products that incorporate masimo set or masimo rainbow set boards and sensors  we have submitted and received fda clearance for k notices covering our masimo set circuit boards  sensors  cables and notification systems 
in the future  we may be required to submit additional k clearance to address new claims  uses or products 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not deem one or more of our future products or those of our oem partners to be a class iii device subject to the more burdensome pma approval process 
the fda also may not approve or clear these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization 
indeed  the fda may refuse our requests for k clearance or pma of new products  new intended uses or modifications to existing products 
pervasive and continuing fda regulation after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply 
those regulatory requirements include product listing and establishment registration  which helps facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory action  qsr  which require manufacturers  including third party manufacturers  to follow stringent design  testing  control  documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process  labeling regulations and fda prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared  unapproved or off label use or indication  clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices  approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our approved devices  medical device reporting  or mdr  regulations  which require that manufacturers comply with fda requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur  post approval restrictions or conditions  including post approval study commitments  post market surveillance regulations  which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device  the fda s recall authority  whereby it can ask  or under certain conditions order  device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations  regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls  and notices of corrections or removals 
we must also register with the fda as a medical device manufacturer and must obtain all necessary state permits or licenses to operate our business 
as a manufacturer  we are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with fda s qsr and other regulations 
our oem partners also are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that our oem partners or we have failed to comply  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines and civil penalties  unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions  
table of contents delays in clearing or approving  or refusal to clear or approve  our products  withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third party suppliers by the fda or other regulatory bodies  product recall or seizure  interruption of production  operating restrictions  injunctions  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us 
our failure or the failure of our oem partners to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other us regulation we and our oem partners also must comply with numerous federal  state and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and hazardous substance disposal 
we cannot be sure that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future or that these laws or regulations will not hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental our manufacturing processes involve the use  generation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  including silicone adhesives  solder and solder paste  sealants  epoxies and various solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone  acetone and isopropyl alcohol 
as such  we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the use  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes 
future environmental laws may require us to alter our manufacturing processes  thereby increasing our manufacturing costs 
we believe that our products and manufacturing processes at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws  however  the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated 
health care fraud and abuse in the united states  there are federal and state anti kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks  bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health related business 
for example  the federal health care programs anti kickback law usc a b b prohibits anyone from  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting or receiving any bribe  kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the referral of patients for  or the purchase  order or recommendation of  health care products and services reimbursed by a federal health care program including medicare and medicaid 
recognizing that the federal anti kickback law is broad and potentially applicable to many commonplace arrangements  the office of inspector general within the department of health and human services  or oig  has issued regulations  known as the safe harbors  which identify permissible practices 
if all of the requirements of an applicable safe harbor are met  an arrangement will not be prosecuted under this law 
safe harbors exist for a number of arrangements relevant to our business  including  among other things  payments to bona fide employees  certain discount and rebate arrangements  and certain payment arrangements involving gpos 
the failure of an arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal 
however  conduct that does not fully satisfy each requirement of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities  such as the oig or the department of justice 
violations of this federal law can result in significant penalties  including imprisonment  monetary fines and assessments  and exclusion from medicare  medicaid and other federal health care programs 
exclusion of a manufacturer  like us  would preclude any federal health care program from paying for its products 
in addition to the federal anti kickback law  many states have their own kickback laws 
often  these state laws closely follow the language of the federal law 
some state anti kickback laws apply regardless of whether federal health care program payment is involved 
federal and state anti kickback laws may affect our sales  marketing and promotional activities  educational programs  pricing and discount practices and policies  and relationships with health care providers by limiting the kinds of arrangements we may have with hospitals  ems providers  gpos  physicians and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products 
federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment to third party payers that are false or fraudulent 
for example  the federal civil false claims act usc et seq 
imposes liability on any person or entity who  among other things  knowingly and willfully presents  or causes to be presented  a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program including medicaid and medicare 
manufacturers  like us  can be held liable under false 
table of contents claims laws  even if they do not submit claims to the government  where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by  among other things  providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims  or by engaging in kickback arrangements with customers that file claims 
a number of states also have false claims laws  and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under medicaid and or commercial insurance 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer s products from reimbursement under government programs  and imprisonment 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  created two new federal crimes health care fraud and false statements related to healthcare matters 
the health care fraud statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private payers 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines  imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs 
the false statements statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items or services 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and imprisonment 
the fcpa and similar worldwide anti bribery laws in non us jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
due to the breadth of some of these laws  it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 
evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulations could adversely affect many of the arrangements we have with customers and physicians 
our risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that some of these laws are broad and open to interpretation 
if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws  we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties  which could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
privacy and security of health information numerous federal  state and international laws and regulations govern the collection  use  and disclosure of patient identifiable health information  including hipaa 
hipaa applies to covered entities  which include most healthcare facilities that purchase and use our products 
the hipaa privacy rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information  and requires covered entities to safeguard that information and to provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information 
the hipaa security rule establishes elaborate requirements for safeguarding patient information transmitted or stored electronically 
we are not a covered entity and our business is not directly subject to hipaa 
in certain circumstances the hipaa rules require covered entities to contractually bind us  as a business associate  to protect the privacy and security of health information we may encounter during activities like training customers on the use of our products or investigating product performance 
the hipaa standards also apply to the use and disclosure of health information for research  and require the covered entity performing the research to obtain the written authorization of the research subject or an appropriate waiver before providing that subject s health information to sponsors like us for purposes related to the research 
these covered entities also typically impose contractual limitations on our use and disclosure of the health information they disclose to us 
we may be required to make costly system modifications to comply with the privacy and security requirements that will be imposed on us contractually by covered entities  and our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business 
numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of patient information  including state medical privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws 
these various laws in many cases are not preempted by the hipaa rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government agencies  creating complex compliance issues for us and our customers and potentially exposing us to additional expense  adverse publicity and liability 
other countries also have  or are developing  laws governing the collection  use and transmission of personal or patient information and these laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business 
new health information standards  whether implemented pursuant to hipaa  congressional action or otherwise  could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle health care related data  and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant 
if we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions 
foreign regulation many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the fda 
international sales are subject to foreign government regulation  the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval and the requirements may differ 
companies are now required to obtain the ce mark prior to sale of some medical devices within the 
table of contents european union 
during this process  the sponsor must demonstrate compliance with the international organization for standardization s manufacturing and quality requirements 
we do have ce marking on all our products that require such markings 
we cannot assure you that we or our oem partners will be able to obtain necessary foreign government approvals or successfully comply with foreign regulations 
our failure to do so could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
third party reimbursement health care providers  including hospitals  that purchase our products generally rely on third party payers  including the medicare and medicaid programs and private payers  such as indemnity insurers and managed care plans  to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the products and the procedures in which they are used 
as a result  demand for our products is dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payers 
no uniform coverage or reimbursement policy for medical technology exists among all third party payers  as coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer 
centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  the federal agency responsible for administering the medicare program  along with its contractors  establish coverage and reimbursement policies for the medicare program 
because a large percentage of the hospitals using our products treat elderly or disabled individuals who are medicare beneficiaries  medicare s coverage and reimbursement policies are particularly significant to our business 
in addition  private payers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of medicare 
we cannot assure you that government or private third party payers will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate 
in general  medicare will cover a medical product or procedure when the product or procedure is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury  or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part 
even if the medical product or procedure is considered medically necessary and coverage is available  medicare may place restrictions on the circumstances where it provides coverage 
for example  several medicare local contractors have issued policies that restrict coverage for pulse oximetry in the hospital inpatient and outpatient settings to a limited number of conditions  including limiting coverage to patients who i exhibit signs of acute respiratory dysfunction  ii have chronic lung disease  severe cardiopulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease involving the muscles of respiration  iii are under treatment with a medication with known pulmonary toxicity  or iv have sustained multiple trauma or complaints of acute chest pain 
reimbursement for our products may vary not only by the type of payer involved but also based upon the setting in which the product is furnished and utilized 
for example  medicare payment may be made  in appropriate cases  for patient stays in the hospital inpatient and outpatient settings involving the use of our products 
medicare generally reimburses hospitals based upon prospectively determined amounts 
for hospital inpatient stays  the prospective payment generally is determined by the patient s condition and other patient data and procedures performed during the inpatient stay  using a classification system known as diagnosis related groups  or drgs 
prospective rates are adjusted for  among other things  regional differences  co morbidity  and complications 
hospitals generally do not receive separate medicare reimbursement for the specific costs of purchasing our products for use in the inpatient setting 
rather  medicare reimbursement for these costs is deemed to be included within the prospective payments made to hospitals for the inpatient services in which the products are utilized 
in contrast  some differences may be seen in the reimbursement for use of our products in hospital outpatient departments 
in this setting  medicare payments also are generally made under a prospective payment system based on the ambulatory payment classifications  or apcs  under which individual items and procedures are categorized 
hospitals receive the applicable apc payment rate for the procedure regardless of the actual cost for such treatment 
some outpatient services such as oximetry services do not receive separate reimbursement 
rather  their reimbursement is deemed packaged into the apc for an associated procedure 
effective january   however  reimbursement for certain pulse oximetry monitoring services  including those using our products  will no longer be packaged  but rather may receive a separate payment under apc overnight pulse oximetry when no other separately payable services are provided 
this could result in an increase in medicare payments to our customers for the use of our products in the hospital outpatient setting 
because pps payments in both the hospital inpatient and outpatient settings are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a hospital s actual costs in furnishing care  hospitals have incentives to lower their operating costs by utilizing products that will reduce the length of inpatient stays  decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs 
we cannot be certain that a hospital will purchase our products  despite the clinical benefits and opportunity for cost savings that we believe can be derived from their use 
if hospitals cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products  or the procedures in which they are used  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our success with rainbow set technologies in us care areas with reimbursable test procedures  such as hospital emergency department  hospital procedure labs  and the physician office will largely depend on the ability of providers to receive reimbursement for such testing procedures 
as of january  masimo received medicare coding and pricing for noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin  with a reimbursable amount of per day 
while private insurance payers generally follow medicare coding and pricing  we cannot be certain of this and in many cases  cannot control the coverage or payment rates that private insurance payers 
table of contents put in place 
we applied for a cpt code for total hemoglobin and believe we will receive coding and pricing by the end of  but we cannot be certain that we will receive such coding or a price that will favorable to providers wishing to include noninvasive total hemoglobin in their practice 
our success in non us markets depends largely upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from the third party payers through which health care providers are paid in those markets 
health care payment systems in non us markets vary significantly by country  and include single payer  government managed systems as well as systems in which private payers and government managed systems exist side by side 
our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets we enter will be dependent in large part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using our products under health care payment systems in such markets 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement for our products  or the procedures in which our products are used  will be obtained or that such reimbursement will be adequate 
manufacturing our strategy is to manufacture products in house when it is efficient and cost effective for us to do so 
we currently manufacture internally our bedside and handheld pulse oximeters  our full line of disposable and reusable sensors and most of our patient cables 
as of january   we had  employees and contract employees in manufacturing and quality worldwide 
we maintain a  square foot international organization for standardization certified manufacturing area in our facility in irvine  california  and a  square foot facility in mexicali  mexico 
we will continue to utilize third party contract manufacturers for products and subassemblies that can be more efficiently manufactured by these parties  such as our circuit boards 
we monitor our third party manufacturers and perform inspections and product tests at various steps in the manufacturing cycle to ensure compliance with our specifications 
we also do full functional testing of our circuit boards 
for raw materials  we and our contract manufacturers rely on sole source suppliers for some components  including digital signal processor chips and analog to digital converter chips 
we and our contract manufacturers have taken steps to minimize the impact of a shortage or stoppage of shipments of digital signal processor chips or analog to digital converter chips  including maintaining excess inventory and designing software that may be easily ported to another digital signal processor chip 
we believe that our sources of supply for components and raw materials are adequate 
in the event of a delay or disruption in the supply of sole source components  we believe that we and our contract manufacturers will be able to locate additional sources of these sole source components on commercially reasonable terms and without experiencing material disruption in our business or operations 
we have four major suppliers  and our agreements with each provide for varying terms with respect to term  termination and pricing 
the initial terms of each of these agreements have expired  however  in each case the parties have either continued to perform under the agreement or the agreement provides for automatic renewal 
while one such agreement does not provide for express termination rights  the remaining three agreements allow for termination upon specified notice  ranging from days to six months  to the non terminating party 
each of these agreements allow for pricing adjustments all four involve annual pricing negotiation  and one also assures us of the most favorable pricing offered to any other customer 
operating segment and geographic information we operate in one business segment  using one measurement of profitability to manage our business 
sales and other financial information by geographic area is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements that are included in this form k 
employees as of january   including masimo labs  we had approximately  full time employees and contract employees worldwide  of which were engaged in research and development   of which were engaged in manufacturing and quality assurance  of which were engaged in sales and marketing and of which were engaged in general and administrative functions

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks come to fruition  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in these circumstances  the market price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we currently derive substantially all of our revenue from our masimo set platform and related products 
if this technology and the related products do not continue to achieve market acceptance  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

table of contents we are dependent upon the success and market acceptance of our proprietary masimo set 
currently  our primary product offerings are based on the masimo set platform 
continued market acceptance of products incorporating masimo set will depend upon our ability to continue to provide evidence to the medical community that our products are cost effective and provide significantly improved performance compared to conventional pulse oximeters 
health care providers that currently have significant investments in competitive pulse oximetry products may be reluctant to purchase our products 
if hospitals and other health care providers do not believe our masimo set platform is cost effective  more accurate or reliable  they may not buy our products in sufficient quantities to enable us to be profitable 
if we are unable to achieve additional market acceptance of our core technology or products incorporating masimo set  we will not generate significant revenue growth from the sale of our products 
if the patents we own or license  or our other intellectual property rights  do not adequately protect our products  we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products  including masimo set and licensed rainbow technology 
we rely on patent protection  trade secrets  as well as a combination of copyright and trademark laws and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
in addition  we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent to us 
the united states patent and trademark office  or pto  may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications  and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications  if any  may not provide us with significant commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous to us 
we could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the pto 
these proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the claims included in our patents 
our issued and licensed patents and those that may be issued or licensed in the future may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products 
additionally  upon expiration of our issued or licensed patents  we may lose some of our rights to exclude others from making  using  selling or importing products using the technology based on the expired patents 
we also must rely on contractual rights with the third parties that license technology to us to protect our rights in the technology licensed to us 
there is no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around our patents 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you that we can meaningfully protect all our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology 
we seek to protect our know how and other unpatented proprietary technology with confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees  our oem partners  independent distributors and consultants 
however  such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information 
in addition  we rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of our products 
our common law trademarks provide less protection than our registered trademarks 
loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
if we fail to apply for intellectual property protection or if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries  our competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us  which could adversely affect our competitive position  as well as our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products 
companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
whether a technology or product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues and is often difficult to determine 
we face the risk of claims that we have infringed on third parties intellectual property rights 
searching for existing intellectual property rights may not reveal important intellectual property and our competitors may also have filed for patent protection  which is not publicly available information  or claimed trademark rights that have not been revealed through our availability searches 
our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third parties intellectual property rights may not always be successful 
any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us  even those without merit  could increase the cost of our products  be expensive and time consuming to defend  result in us being required to pay significant damages to third parties  force us to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  require us to redesign  reengineer or rebrand our products  product candidates and technologies  
table of contents require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party s intellectual property on terms that may not be favorable or acceptable to us  require us to indemnify third parties pursuant to contracts in which we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement claims  divert the attention of our management and other key employees  result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products impacted by the claims until the claims are resolved  and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  new patents obtained by our competitors could threaten the continued commercialization of our products in the market even after they have already been introduced 
we believe competitors may currently be violating and may in the future violate our intellectual property rights  and we may bring additional litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  which may result in substantial expense and may divert our attention from implementing our business strategy 
we believe that the success of our business depends  in significant part  on obtaining patent protection for our products and technologies  defending our patents and preserving our trade secrets 
we were previously involved in significant litigation to protect our patent position and may be required to engage in further litigation 
in  we settled a costly  six year lawsuit against mallinckrodt  inc  part of tyco healthcare currently covidien ltd  and one of its subsidiaries  nellcor puritan bennett  inc  in which we claimed that nellcor was infringing some of our pulse oximetry signal processing patents 
we believe that other competitors of ours  including some of our oem partners  may be infringing at least one of our patents 
our failure to pursue any potential claim could result in the loss of our proprietary rights and harm our position in the marketplace 
therefore  we may be forced to pursue litigation to enforce our rights 
on february   we filed a patent infringement suit against philips electronics north america corporation and philips medizin systeme b blingen gmbh related to philips fast pulse oximetry technology and certain philips patient monitors 
both philips electronics north america corporation and philips medizin systeme b blingen gmbh are associated with philips medical systems  an oem partner of ours 
we cannot be certain that we will have the required financial resources to pursue this and other litigation or otherwise to protect these rights in the future 
in addition  any future litigation could result in significant additional costs and further divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and the implementation of our business strategy and may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property rights 
some of our products  including those based on licensed rainbow technology  are in development or have been recently introduced into the market and may not achieve market acceptance  which could limit our growth and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products that have been recently introduced into the market  including  but not limited to those based on rainbow technology  a technology that we license  may not be accepted in the market 
our first product incorporating licensed rainbow technology was made commercially available in september given that all rainbow technologies are new to the marketplace  we do not know to what degree the market will accept these products  if at all 
even if our customers recognize the benefits of our products  we cannot assure you that our customers will purchase them in quantities sufficient for us to be profitable or successful 
we will need to invest in significant sales and marketing resources to achieve market acceptance of these products with no assurance of success 
the degree of market acceptance of these products will depend on a number of factors  including perceived effectiveness of our products  cost of our products  perceived advantages of our products over competing products  introduction and acceptance of competing products or technologies  and obtaining the required domestic and international regulatory approvals for our product candidates under development 
in march  we introduced our most recent rainbow parameter  total hemoglobin 
in may  we received fda clearance to begin to market this new parameter 
in september  we began our limited market release of the product and focused on obtaining data and clinical feedback on the performance of the product in the hospital 
since september  we have continued to gather data and input on the device  and expect to continue this activity through the first quarter of in the first or second quarter of  we intend to commercially launch our total hemoglobin product for continuous monitoring in the hospital 
while we are enthusiastic about the products long term market potential  we cannot determine how quickly or successfully the product will be received within its initial targeted market 
as with any new technology  there are significant barriers to market adoption and we cannot be assured that the marketplace will respond favorably to this new technology and product 

table of contents in the second half of  we intend to release our latest parameter  acoustic respiration monitoring  or arm 
as with our total hemoglobin release  we will initially provide this new measurement to the market in a limited market release which will allow us to evaluate the product s performance in the field 
while we believe that we should be able to achieve this market timing  there can be no assurances of this timing and or the regulatory approvals still required 
also  while we expect this product will have an important role within the hospital general floor environment  there can be no assurance that this product will receive be successful within this initial target market 
as with any new technology  there are significant barriers to market adoption and we cannot be assured that the marketplace will respond favorably to this new technology and product 
in order for any of our products to be accepted in the marketplace  we must demonstrate that they are effective and commercially beneficial 
even if customers accept these products  this acceptance may not result in sales if our competitors develop similar products that our customers prefer 
if our products do not gain market acceptance or if our customers prefer our competitors products  our potential growth would be limited  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury  we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations  which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions 
under the fda medical device reporting  or mdr  regulations  we are required to report to the fda any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and  if the malfunction were to recur  would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury 
in addition  all manufacturers placing medical devices in european union markets are legally bound to report to the relevant authority in whose jurisdiction any serious or potentially serious incidents occurred involving devices produced or sold by the manufacturer 
we may experience events that may require reporting to the fda pursuant to the mdr regulations 
any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions  including recalls or customer notifications  or agency action  including inspection  mandatory recall or other enforcement action 
any corrective action  whether voluntary or involuntary  as well as any litigation resulting from any adverse event  would require the dedication of our time and capital  distract management from operating our business and could harm our reputation  business operations and financial results 
our products have been  and may in the future be  subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation  business operations and financial results 
after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements apply  including mdr regulations  that require us to report to the fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
the fda and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects  in for example  design  labeling or manufacture 
in the case of the fda  the authority to require a recall generally must be based on an fda finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death 
in addition  foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
manufacturers may  under their own initiative  recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found 
a government mandated or voluntary recall by us or by one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors  design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues 
recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may initiate certain voluntary recalls involving our products in the future 
companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls  even if they are not reportable to the fda 
if we determine that a recall does not require notification of the fda  the fda may disagree with our determination and require us to report the recall to the fda 
from our inception through january   we initiated four voluntary recalls of our products  none of which was material 
each of these recalls was reported to the fda within the appropriate regulatory timeframes 
because of our dependence upon patient and physician perceptions  any negative publicity associated with these voluntary recalls could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects 
recent deterioration in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  they may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations if our customers ability to borrow money from their existing lenders  or to obtain credit from other sources to purchase our products under long term sensor agreements  were to be impaired 
this credit market deterioration could affect our ability to acquire new customers for our products 
in addition  the recent economic crisis could also adversely impact our suppliers ability to provide us with materials and components  either of which may negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and such losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past  especially given the recent deterioration of the credit markets of the worldwide economy 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required 
these additional allowances could materially affect our financial results 
our ability to commercialize new products  new or improved technologies and additional applications for masimo set and our right to use rainbow technology are each limited to certain markets by our cross licensing agreement with masimo labs  which may impair our growth and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in may  we created a newly formed entity  masimo laboratories  inc  or masimo labs  and provided it rights to use masimo set to commercialize non vital signs monitoring applications while we retained the rights to masimo set to commercialize vital signs monitoring applications 
on may   we entered into a cross licensing agreement with masimo labs  which has been amended several times  most recently in an amended and restated cross licensing agreement  effective january   or the cross licensing agreement 
under the cross licensing agreement  we granted masimo labs an exclusive  perpetual and worldwide license  with sublicense rights  to use all masimo set owned by us  including all improvements on this technology  for the measurement of non vital signs measurements and to develop and sell devices incorporating masimo set for monitoring non vital signs measurements in any product market in which a product is intended to be used by a patient or pharmacist rather than by a professional medical caregiver  which we refer to as the labs market  and a non exclusive  perpetual and worldwide license  with sublicense rights  to use all masimo set for measurement of vital signs in the labs market 
non vital signs measurements consist of body fluid constituents other than vital signs measurements  including but not limited to carbon monoxide  methemoglobin  blood glucose  total hemoglobin and bilirubin 
under the cross licensing agreement  we are only permitted to sell devices utilizing masimo set for the measurement of non vital signs measurements in markets where the product is intended to be used by a professional medical caregiver  including but not limited to hospital caregivers and emergency medical services  or ems  facility caregivers  rather than by a patient or pharmacist  which we refer to as the masimo market 
accordingly  our ability to commercialize new products  new or improved technologies and additional applications for masimo set is limited 
in particular  our inability to expand beyond the masimo market may impair our growth and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
pursuant to the cross licensing agreement  we have licensed from masimo labs the right to make and distribute products in the masimo market that utilize rainbow technology for the measurement of only carbon monoxide  methemoglobin  fractional arterial oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin  which includes hematocrit 
as a result  the opportunity to expand the market for our products incorporating rainbow technology is limited  which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and impair our growth 
we will be required to pay masimo labs for the right to use certain improvements to masimo set that we develop 
under the cross licensing agreement  if we develop improvements to masimo set for the noninvasive measurement of non vital signs measurements  we would be required to assign these developments to masimo labs and then license the technology back from masimo labs in consideration for a license fee and royalty obligations to masimo labs 
therefore  any improvement to this technology would be treated as if it had been developed exclusively by masimo labs 
in addition  we will not be reimbursed by masimo labs for our expenses relating to the development of any such technology 
as a result of these terms  we may not generate any revenue from the further development of masimo set for the measurement of non vital signs measurements  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that the cross licensing agreement is terminated for any reason  or masimo labs grants a license to rainbow technology to a third party  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
masimo labs owns all of the proprietary rights to rainbow technology developed with our proprietary masimo set for products intended to be used in the labs market  and all rights for any non vital signs measurement for which we do not exercise an option pursuant to the cross licensing agreement 
in addition  masimo labs has the right to terminate the cross licensing agreement or grant licenses covering rainbow technology to third parties if we breach certain terms of the agreement  including any failure to meet our minimum royalty payment obligations or failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or market products incorporating licensed rainbow technology 
if we lose our exclusive license to rainbow technology  we may not be able to develop comparable technology or license similar technology on commercially favorable terms or at all  and we would lose the ability to prevent others from making  using  selling or importing products using rainbow technology in our market 
as a result  we would likely be subject to increased competition within our market  and masimo labs or competitors who obtain a license to rainbow technology from masimo labs would be able to offer related products 

table of contents we are required to pay royalties to masimo labs for all products sold that contain rainbow technology  including certain annual minimum royalty payments  and this may impact our gross margins  if we discontinue consolidating masimo labs within our financial statements 
the cross licensing agreement requires us to pay masimo labs a royalty for all products that we sell which include their proprietary rainbow technology 
this includes handheld  table top and multi measurement products that incorporate licensed rainbow technology 
beginning in  for hospital contracts where we place equipment and enter into a sensor contract  we will pay a royalty to masimo labs on the total sensor contract revenue based on the ratio of rainbow enabled devices to total devices 
the agreement also requires that we provide to masimo labs  at its request  up to of our annual board and sensor production volume at our total manufactured cost 
in addition to these specific royalty and product obligations  our cross licensing agreement requires that we pay masimo labs specific annual minimum royalty payments 
currrently  in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 or fin r  we are currently required to consolidate masimo labs within our financial statements 
accordingly  the royalties that we owe to masimo labs are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements presented within this form k 
as a result  the gross profit margins reported in our consolidated financial results do not include the royalty expense that we pay to masimo labs 
also in accordance with fin r  we are obligated to include masimo labs engineering and administrative expenses in our reported engineering and administrative expenses 
as a result  our reported engineering and administrative expenses include masimo labs s engineering and administrative expenses 
if our financial statements were not consolidated with masimo labs  our reported cost of goods sold would increase and our reported engineering and administrative expenses would decrease 
as a result of this requirement to consolidate  we report within our public filings  both our reported gross profit  engineering expense and administrative expenses as if we were not required to consolidate 
to date  the amount of royalty expense has approximated the amount of engineering and administrative expense and therefore  the net impact to our consolidated financial statements has not been significant 
however  in the future  depending upon the success of rainbow products and the royalties earned by labs on those revenues  it is possible that the royalty expense will grow at a rate higher than the growth of engineering and administrative expenses 
in the event the net impact on our consolidated results is material  we will reflect the amount of labs income through our profit and loss statement as an element of minority interest income 
as a result  despite the current requirement to consolidate  any profit in our consolidated financial results that is attributable to masimo labs will be separately identified 
despite describing and reflecting this masimo labs consolidation requirement within our financial statements  it is possible that  if the reader of our financial statements do not understand or appreciate the significant of our consolidation of masimo labs financial statements in our fin r  they may draw inaccurate perspectives and conclusions regarding our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to commercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow technology cost effectively or successfully 
it is more expensive for us to make products that incorporate rainbow technology than products that do not due to increased production costs and the royalties that we must pay to masimo labs 
in order to successfully commercialize products incorporating rainbow technology  we must be able to pass these higher costs on to the market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell products incorporating rainbow technology at a price the market is willing to accept 
if we cannot commercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow technology successfully  we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue from these products to be profitable  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rights provided to masimo labs in the cross licensing agreement may impede a change in control of our company 
in the event we undergo a change in control  we are required to immediately pay a million fee to exercise an option to license technology developed by masimo labs for use in blood glucose monitoring 
under the cross licensing agreement  a change in control includes  but is not limited to  the resignation or termination of joe e 
kiani from his position of chief executive officer of either masimo or masimo labs 
additionally  our per product royalties payable to masimo labs will become subject to specified minimums  and the minimum aggregate annual royalties for all licensed rainbow measurements payable to masimo labs will increase to up to million for carbon monoxide  methemoglobin  fractional arterial oxygen saturation  total hemoglobin and blood glucose  plus up to million per other rainbow measurements 
also  if the surviving or acquiring entity ceases to use masimo as a company name and trademark following a change in control  all rights to the masimo trademark will automatically be assigned to masimo labs 
this could delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over our then current trading price 
in addition  our requirement to assign all future improvements for non vital signs to masimo labs could impede a change in control 
masimo labs has conducted most of the research and development of rainbow technology and we are dependent upon masimo labs to develop improvements to rainbow technology 
masimo labs has conducted the research and development of rainbow technology 
although we expect masimo labs to continue its research and development activities related to rainbow technology and specific noninvasive monitoring measurements  including 
table of contents blood glucose and total hemoglobin  no assurance can be given that it will do so 
in the event masimo labs does not continue to develop and improve rainbow technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we will experience conflicts of interest with masimo labs with respect to business opportunities and other matters 
prior to our initial public offering in august  our stockholders owned approximately of the outstanding shares of capital stock of masimo labs and we believe that as of january   a number of stockholders of masimo labs  including some of our executive officers and directors  continued to own shares of our common stock 
in addition  joe e 
kiani and jack lasersohn  members of our board of directors  are also members of the board of directors of masimo labs 
joe e 
kiani  our chairman and chief executive officer  is also the chairman and chief executive officer of masimo labs 
due to the interrelated nature of masimo labs with us  conflicts of interest will arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between us and masimo labs  potential acquisitions of businesses or products  development of products and technology  the sale of products  markets and other matters in which our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders may conflict with the best interests of the stockholders of masimo labs 
we cannot assure you that any conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor  or that with respect to our transactions with masimo labs we will negotiate terms that are as favorable to us as if such transactions were with an unaffiliated third party 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results and we may not maintain our recent profitability in the future 
we incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders in each year from our inception through our net losses attributable to common stockholders were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect our expenses to increase as we continue to expand our research and development and sales and marketing activities 
as a result  if we are unable to maintain or increase our revenue  we may incur net losses in the future 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
we may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations as a result of delays or interruptions in manufacturing and shipping of our products  varying demand for and market acceptance of our technologies and products  the effect of competing technological and market developments resulting in lower selling prices or significant promotional costs  changes in the timing of product orders and the volume of sales to our oem partners  actions taken by group purchasing organizations  or gpos  delays in hospital conversions to our products  declines in hospital patient census  our legal expenses  particularly those related to litigation matters  changes in our product or customer mix  unanticipated delays or problems in the introduction of new products  including delays in obtaining clearance or approval from the fda  product recalls  and high levels of returns and repairs 
these factors  some of which are not within our control  may cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially 
to respond to these and other factors  we may need to make business decisions that could result in our failure to meet financial expectations 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly 
most of our expenses  including our employee compensation  inventory and debt repayment obligations  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if our revenue for a particular period were below our expectations  we would not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that period 
any revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our operating results for the period 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
in future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
we depend on our oem partners for a portion of our revenue 
if they do not devote sufficient resources to the promotion of products that use masimo set and licensed rainbow technology  our business would be harmed 
we are  and will continue to be  dependent upon our oem partners for a portion of our revenue through their marketing  selling and distribution of certain of their products that incorporate masimo set and licensed rainbow technology 
although we expect that our oem partners will accept and actively market  sell and distribute products that incorporate licensed rainbow technology  they may 
table of contents elect not  and they have no contractual obligation  to do so in the near future or at all 
the failure of our oem partners to successfully market  sell or distribute products incorporating these technologies  the termination of oem agreements  the loss of oem partners or the inability to enter into future oem partnership agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success will depend in part upon whether our oem partners devote sufficient resources to the promotion of products that incorporate these technologies 
these products may represent a relatively small percentage of business for some of our oem partners and therefore they may have less incentive to promote these products rather than other products that do not incorporate these technologies  the desire and ability of our oems to commit these resources could be negatively impacted by the current turbulent and volatile economic turmoil 
in addition  some of our oem partners offer products that compete with ours 
therefore  we cannot guarantee that our oem partners will vigorously promote products incorporating masimo set and licensed rainbow technology  or at all 
if any of our oem partners were to be acquired  we cannot assure you that an acquiring company would devote sufficient resources to promote products that incorporate technology we own or license 
the loss of any large customer or any cancellation or delay of a significant purchase by a large customer could reduce our net sales and harm our operating results 
we also have a concentration of oem  distribution and direct customers 
if for any reason we were to lose our ability to sell to a specific group or class of customers  we would experience a significant reduction in revenue  which would adversely impact our operating results 
also  we cannot assure you that we will retain our current customers or groups of customers or that we will be able to attract and retain additional customers in the future 
for the years ended january  and december   one of our distributors represented and  respectively  of our total revenue 
no distributors represented over of our total revenue for the year ended december  our royalty agreement with covidien provides for a royalty rate schedule that could decline over the term of the settlement agreement which could significantly harm our total sales and operating results 
in fiscal  our royalties from the covidien settlement totaled million 
because these royalty payments do not carry any significant cost  they result in significant improvements to our reported gross profit and operating income levels 
as a result  any decline in royalties that we earn under the settlement agreement in the future will have a significant impact on our revenue  gross margins and operating income 
under the agreement  we earn royalties on covidien s total us based pulse oximetry sales 
the royalty rate in was nearly if averaged over the entire year 
the royalty rate for fiscal declined to 
in and through the term of the royalty agreement  at least through march   the royalty rate is  but may decline to  subject to covidien s ability to develop new products that avoid some of our current patent coverage as negotiated in the settlement agreement 
as a result  there is a significant financial risk to our operating income if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue and gross margins to offset the impact of declining royalty rates on sales of covidien s pulse oximetry products in the united states 
if we fail to maintain relationships with gpos  sales of our products would decline 
our ability to sell our products to us hospitals depends in part on our relationships with gpos 
many existing and potential customers for our products become members of gpos 
gpos negotiate beneficial pricing arrangements and contracts  which are sometimes exclusive  with medical supply manufacturers and distributors 
these negotiated prices are made available to a gpo s affiliated hospitals and other members 
if we are not one of the providers selected by a gpo  the gpo s affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely or unlikely to purchase our products 
if a gpo has negotiated a strict sole source  market share compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer s products  we may be prohibited from making sales to members of the gpo for the duration of the contractual arrangement 
in the fiscal years ended january   december  and december   shipments of our pulse oximetry products related to gpos were million  million and million  respectively 
our failure to renew our contracts with gpos may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our sales  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we are unable to develop new relationships with gpos  our competitive position would likely suffer and our business would be harmed 
if we do not successfully develop and commercialize enhanced or new products that remain competitive with new products or alternative techniques developed by others  we could lose revenue opportunities and customers  and our ability to grow our business would be impaired 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances  which places our products at risk of obsolescence 
our long term success depends upon the development and successful commercialization of new products  new or improved technologies and additional applications for masimo set and licensed rainbow technology 
the research and development process is time consuming and costly and may not result in products or applications that we can successfully commercialize 
in particular  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products for applications other than arterial blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate monitoring  including carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin monitoring 
if we do not successfully adapt our products and applications both within and outside these measurements  we could lose revenue opportunities and customers 
in addition  we may not be able to improve our products or develop new products or technologies quickly enough to maintain a competitive position in our 
table of contents markets and continue to grow our business 
furthermore  one or more of our competitors may develop products that are substantially equivalent to our fda cleared products  or those of our oem partners  whereby they may be able to use our products or those of our oem partners  as predicate devices to more quickly obtain fda clearance of their competing products 
we face competition from other companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to develop products perceived as more effective or easier to use than ours or are more readily accepted  or offer their products at lower prices than we can  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face substantial competition from companies developing products that compete with our masimo set platform for use with third party monitoring systems 
we also face competition from companies currently marketing pulse oximetry monitors 
one company  covidien  currently holds a substantial share of the pulse oximetry market 
our revenue and profit are significantly smaller than our primary competitors 
a number of the companies in the pulse oximetry market have substantially greater capital resources  larger customer bases  larger sales forces  greater marketing and management resources  larger research and development staffs and larger facilities than ours  and have established stronger reputations with our target customers and built relationships with gpos and worldwide distribution channels that are more effective than ours 
competition could result in reductions in the price of our products  fewer orders for our products  a reduction of our gross margins and a loss of our market share 
reliance on clinical studies is an important means of demonstrating the effectiveness of products in our industry 
if clinical studies supporting our competitors products are perceived to be accurate and reliable  market acceptance and sales of our products could be adversely impacted and we could lose market share to our competitors 
our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of materials and components or materials and components of adequate quality 
we depend on sole or limited source suppliers for key materials and components of our noninvasive blood constituent patient monitoring solutions  and if we are unable to obtain these components on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our noninvasive blood constituent patient monitoring solutions to customers 
also  we cannot guarantee that any of the materials or components that we purchase  if available at all  will be of adequate quality or that the prices we pay for these materials or components will not increase 
from time to time  there are industry wide shortages of several electronic components that we use in our noninvasive blood constituent patient monitoring solutions 
we may experience delays in production of our products if we fail to identify alternate vendors for materials and components  or any parts supply is interrupted or reduced or there is a significant increase in production costs  each of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers 
many of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies 
we may be subject to claims that our employees have disclosed  or that we have used  trade secrets or other proprietary information of our employees former employers 
defending against these claims could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management 
if we fail in defending such claims  in addition to paying monetary damages  we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel 
a loss of key research and development or sales personnel could limit our ability to sell our existing products and develop new products and technologies  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if product liability claims are brought against us  we could face substantial liability and costs 
the manufacture and sale of products using masimo set and licensed rainbow technology expose us to product liability claims and product recalls  including those that may arise from misuse  including but not limited to unauthorized off label use  which is use of a device in a manner outside the measurement or measurements cleared by the fda  or malfunction of  or design flaws or manufacturing defects in  our products or the use of our products with incompatible components or systems 
any losses that we may suffer from future liability claims  and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability of our technology and products  together with the corresponding diversion of the attention of our key employees  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any product liability claims could require significant cost and management resources and may subject us to significant damages 
we currently have product liability insurance that we believe to be adequate  but we cannot be certain that it will be sufficient to cover any or all damages or claims 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts to protect us against any product liability claims 
our failure to obtain and maintain fda clearances or approvals on a timely basis  or at all  would prevent us from commercializing our current or upgraded products in the united states  which could severely harm our business 
each medical device that we wish to market in the united states generally must first receive either k clearance from the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act by filing a k pre market notification  or pre market approval  or pma  through submitting a pma application 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed 
we cannot assure you that the fda will grant k clearance on a 
table of contents timely basis  if at all  for new products or uses that we propose for masimo set or licensed rainbow technology 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to six months  although it can take longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain and generally takes from one to three years or even longer 
to date  the fda has regulated pulse oximeters incorporating masimo set and licensed rainbow technology  and our sensors  cables and other products incorporating masimo set and licensed rainbow technology for pulse oximetry under the k process 
although k clearances have been obtained for all of our current products  these clearances may be revoked by the fda at any time if safety or effectiveness problems develop with our devices 
furthermore  our new products or significantly modified marketed products could be denied k clearance and be required to undergo the more burdensome pma process 
in that case  our ability to upgrade our products in a timely fashion could be limited 
the withdrawal of existing k clearances or the inability to obtain new ones on a timely basis  or at all  could severely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the failure of our oem partners to obtain required fda clearances or approvals for products that incorporate our products or technologies could have a negative impact on our revenue 
our oem partners will be required to obtain their own fda clearances for products incorporating masimo set and licensed rainbow technology to market these products in the united states 
we cannot assure you that the fda clearances we have obtained will make it easier for our oem partners to obtain clearances of products incorporating these technologies  or that the fda will ever grant clearances on a timely basis  if at all  for any future product incorporating masimo set and licensed rainbow technology that our oem partners propose to market 
if we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements  or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products  these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market 
our products  along with the manufacturing processes and promotional activities for such products  are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory bodies 
in particular  we and our suppliers are required to comply with the qsr which covers the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  component suppliers control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging  storage and shipping of our products 
the fda enforces the qsr through unannounced inspections 
we are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses 
failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with statutes and regulations administered by the fda and other regulatory bodies  discovery of previously unknown problems with our products including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  manufacturing problems  or failure to comply with regulatory requirements  or failure to adequately respond to any fda observations concerning these issues  could result in  among other things  any of the following actions warning letters or untitled letters issued by the fda  fines and civil penalties  unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions  delays in clearing or approving  or refusal to clear or approve  our products  withdrawal or suspension of clearance or approval of our products or those of our third party suppliers by the fda or other regulatory bodies  product recall or seizure  orders for physician notification or device repair  replacement or refund  interruption of production  operating restrictions  injunctions  and criminal prosecution 
if any of these actions were to occur  it would harm our reputation and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  our key component suppliers may not currently be  or may not continue to be  in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products abroad 
we currently market and intend to continue to market our products internationally 
outside the united states  we can market a product only if we receive a marketing authorization and  in some cases  pricing approval  from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the approval procedure varies among international jurisdictions and may require additional testing 
the time required to obtain approval internationally may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval in addition to other risks 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely 
table of contents basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the fda 
if we fail to receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis  or at all  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
modifications to our marketed devices may require new regulatory clearances or premarket approvals  or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified devices until clearances or approvals are obtained 
any modifications to an fda cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new k clearance or possibly a pma approval 
we may not be able to obtain such clearances or approvals in a timely fashion  or at all 
delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have made modifications to our devices in the past and we may make additional modifications in the future  some of which we may believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals 
if the fda disagrees with our conclusion and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications  we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
off label promotion of our products or promotional claims deemed false or misleading could subject us to substantial penalties 
obtaining k clearance only permits us to promote our products for the uses specifically cleared by the fda 
use of a device outside its cleared or approved indications is known as off label use 
physicians may use our products off label because the fda does not restrict or regulate a physician s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine 
although we may request additional cleared indications for our current products  the fda may deny those requests  require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared product as a condition of clearance 
we must have adequate substantiation for our product performance claims 
if the fda determines that we or our oem partners have promoted our products for off label use or have made false or misleading or inadequately substantiated promotional claims  it could request that we or our oem partners modify those promotional materials or take regulatory or enforcement actions  including the issuance of an untitled letter  a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and criminal penalties 
it is also possible that other federal  state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities  such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement 
in that event  our reputation could be damaged and adoption of our products would be impaired 
although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off label promotion of our products  the fda or another regulatory agency could conclude that we have engaged in off label promotion 
in addition  the off label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients  and  in turn  the risk of product liability claims 
product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us 
federal regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
from time to time  legislation is drafted and introduced in congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval  manufacture and marketing of medical devices 
in addition  fda regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the fda in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products 
it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or fda regulations  guidance or interpretations changed  and what the impact of such changes  if any  may be 
however  any changes could make it more difficult for us to maintain or attain approval to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates 
the food and drug administration amendments act of  or the amendments  requires  among other things  that the fda propose and ultimately implement regulations that will require manufacturers to label medical devices with unique identifiers unless a waiver is received from the fda 
once implemented  compliance with those regulations may require us to take additional steps in the manufacture of our products and labeling 
these steps may require additional resources and could be costly 
in addition  the amendments will require us to  among other things  pay annual establishment registration fees to the fda for each of our fda registered facilities 
if we are unable to increase our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities or maintain or establish arrangements with third parties to sell  market  manufacture and distribute our pulse oximetry and rainbow technology products  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have limited sales and marketing experience both in the united states and internationally and may not be successful in developing and implementing our business strategy 
in addition  we currently have a small sales organization compared to many of our competitors 
to increase our commercial capabilities  we need to increase our sales and marketing forces  
table of contents continue to maintain domestic and international oem partners  ensure that distributors and oem partners provide the technical and educational support customers need to use products incorporating masimo set and rainbow technology successfully  promote monitoring systems using masimo set and rainbow technology so that sales of those systems and our sensors increase  and be prepared to provide services  as necessary  to geographically dispersed users of monitoring systems using masimo set and rainbow technology 
failure to accomplish any of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently plan to increase the size of our direct sales force to further market our products in the united states and internationally 
our sales force will be competing with the experienced and well funded sales and marketing operations of our competitors 
increasing our direct sales capabilities will be expensive and time consuming 
we may not be able to further develop this capacity on a timely basis or at all 
if we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities  we will need to continue to contract with third parties to market and sell our approved products in the united states and internationally 
to the extent that we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales  marketing and distribution services  our product revenue could be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products 
furthermore  to the extent that we enter into co promotion or other sales and marketing arrangements with other companies  any revenue received will depend on the skills and efforts of others  and we do not know whether these efforts will be successful 
if we are unable to maintain adequate sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution capabilities  independently or with others  we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue to be profitable 
if we are unable to manufacture an adequate supply of our products  we could lose customers and our revenue and growth could be limited 
our anticipated growth may strain our ability to manufacture an increasingly large supply of our products 
manufacturing facilities often experience difficulties in scaling up production  including problems with production yields and quality control and assurance 
if we cannot scale our manufacturing operations appropriately  maintain control over expenses or otherwise adapt to anticipated growth  or if we have underestimated our future growth  we may not have the capability to satisfy market demand  which would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we anticipate and plan for significant growth  which we may not be able to effectively manage 
both domestically and internationally  we expect to rapidly expand our operations and our research and development  product development  sales  marketing and administrative organizations 
this growth and activity will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management and place a significant strain upon our operating and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate our expected growth and compete effectively  we will be required to improve our current infrastructure  including information systems  as well as create additional processes  procedures and controls and expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
we also may need to expand our manufacturing resources 
we cannot be certain that our personnel  infrastructure  financial systems  processes  procedures  asset management  facilities and controls will be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to effectively manage our growth could impede our ability to successfully develop  market and sell our products and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we manufacture our products at two locations 
any disruption in these manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  we have relied on our manufacturing facilities in irvine  california and mexicali  mexico 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
earthquakes are of particular significance since our irvine  california facility is located in an earthquake prone area 
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  including power loss  attacks from extremist organizations  fire  floods and similar events 
in the event that one of our facilities was affected by a natural or man made disaster  we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers if we could not shift production to our other manufacturing facility 
although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties  such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are forced to seek alternative facilities  we may incur additional costs and we may experience a disruption in the supply of our products until those facilities are available 
any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to produce sufficient inventory of our products or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory  and  therefore  may adversely affect our revenue  gross margins and results of operations 
any disruption or delay at our manufacturing facilities could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and 
table of contents our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the future  we may choose to add new manufacturing capabilities in either our existing facilities or in new facilities throughout the world 
if we expand our worldwide manufacturing locations  there can be no assurance that this expansion will occur without implementation difficulties  or at all  or that such expansion will ultimately lower our overall cost of production 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  or if we are unable to attract and retain other key personnel  we may not be able to manage our operations or meet our growth objectives 
we are highly dependent on our senior management  especially joe e 
kiani  our chief executive officer  and other key officers 
we are also heavily dependent on our engineers and field sales team  including sales representatives and clinical specialists 
our success will depend on our ability to retain our current management  engineers and field sales team  and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future  including scientists  clinicians  engineers and other highly skilled personnel 
competition for senior management  engineers and field sales personnel is intense and we may not be able to retain our personnel 
the loss of the services of members of our key personnel could prevent the implementation and completion of our objectives  including the development and introduction of our products 
in general  our officers may terminate their employment at any time without notice for any reason 
in some specific situations  officers who signed a severance agreement  have agreed to provide the company up to six months of notice in the event they elect to terminate their employment for any reason 
we carry key person life insurance on only mr 
kiani  who is also the chief executive officer of masimo labs 
mr 
kiani devotes most of his time to us 
existing or future acquisitions of businesses could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses successfully into our existing operations or if we discover previously undisclosed liabilities 
in order to expand our products and technology platform  we have acquired four businesses since our inception and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
successful acquisitions depend upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing 
even if we complete acquisitions  we may experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions 
in addition  an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize acquisition expenses and acquired assets 
we may also discover deficiencies in internal controls  data adequacy and integrity  product quality  regulatory compliance and product liabilities that we did not uncover prior to our acquisition of such businesses  which could result in us becoming subject to penalties or other liabilities 
any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected penalties or liabilities in connection with such businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state health care laws  including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws  and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with these laws 
although we do not provide health care services or receive payments directly from medicare  medicaid or other third party payers for our products or the procedures in which our products are used  health care regulation by federal and state governments will impact our business 
health care fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws potentially applicable to our operations include  but are not limited to the federal health care programs anti kickback law  which prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase  order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal health care program such as the medicare or medicaid programs  federal false claims laws which prohibit  among other things  knowingly and willfully presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment from medicare  medicaid  or other third party payers that are false or fraudulent  the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  and its implementing regulations  which established federal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits  items or 
table of contents services  as well as imposed certain requirements relating to the privacy  security and transmission of individually identifiable health information  and state laws analogous to each of the above federal laws  such as anti kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by non governmental third party payers  including commercial insurers  and state laws governing the privacy of certain health information 
we have certain arrangements with hospitals that may be affected by these laws 
for instance  under our standard customer arrangements  we provide hospitals with free pulse oximetry monitoring devices in exchange for their agreement to purchase future pulse oximetry sensor requirements from us 
in addition  we occasionally provide our customers with rebates in connection with their annual purchases 
while we believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable federal and state health care laws  one or more of these arrangements may not meet the federal anti kickback law s safe harbor requirements  which may result in increased scrutiny by government authorities that are responsible for enforcing these laws 
there can be no assurance that we will not be found to be in violation of any of such laws or other similar governmental regulations to which we are directly or indirectly subject  and as a result we may be subject to penalties  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion of our products from reimbursement under medicare  medicaid and other federal health care programs  and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations 
any penalties could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
any action against us for violation of these laws  even if we successfully defend against them  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business 
we face environmental and personal injury liabilities related to certain hazardous materials used in our operations 
our manufacturing processes involve the use  generation and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes  including silicone adhesives  solder and solder paste  sealants  epoxies and various solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone  acetone and isopropyl alcohol 
as a result  we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the use  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes 
we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations 
future environmental laws may significantly affect our operations because  for instance  our manufacturing processes may be required to be altered  which may increase our manufacturing costs 
in our research and manufacturing activities  we use  and our employees  may be exposed to  materials that are hazardous to human health  safety or the environment 
these materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our facility pending ultimate use and disposal 
the risk of accidental injury  including to our employees  or contamination from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any such liability could exceed our reserves 
although we maintain general liability insurance  we do not specifically insure against environmental liabilities 
if an enforcement action were to occur  our reputation and our business and financial condition may be harmed  even if we were to prevail or settle the action on terms favorable to us 
the risks inherent in operating internationally and the risks of selling and shipping our products and of purchasing our components and products internationally may adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we derive a portion of our net sales from international operations 
in fiscal  and   and  respectively  of our product revenue was derived from our international operations 
in addition  we purchase a portion of our raw materials and components on the international market 
the sale and shipping of our products across international borders  as well as the purchase of materials and components from international sources  subject us to extensive us and foreign governmental trade regulations 
compliance with such regulations is costly and we would be exposed to potentially significant penalties for non compliance 
any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties  including imprisonment of individuals  fines and penalties  denial of export privileges  seizure of shipments  restrictions on certain business activities  and exclusion or debarment from government contracting 
also  the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping and sales activities 
in addition  our international sales operations expose us and our representatives  agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions 
these risks include  but are not limited to the imposition of additional us and foreign governmental controls or regulations  the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements  a shortage of high quality sales people and distributors  loss of any key personnel that possess proprietary knowledge  or who are otherwise important to our success in certain international markets  changes in duties and tariffs  license obligations and other non tariff barriers to trade  the imposition of new trade restrictions  the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents  representatives and distributors  
table of contents scrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines  penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us  pricing pressure that we may experience internationally  laws and business practices favoring local companies  possible failure to comply with anti bribery laws such as the fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions  political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts  longer payment cycles  and difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not harm our business 
any material decrease in our international sales would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our new international business structure may not result in expected operational benefits 
in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a new international business structure designed to better serve and support our growing international business 
by centralizing our international operations  including sales management  marketing  customer support  planning  logistics and administrative functions  we believe we will be able to develop a more efficient and scalable international organization capable of being even more responsive to the business needs of our international customers all under one centralized management structure 
we commenced the implementation of an international business structure to align our operations with the business needs of our non us customers and we believe that we may  in the long run  also benefit from certain operational benefits as well as a lower overall tax rate 
however  there can be no assurance that our efforts will produce any anticipated operational benefits or provide an overall lower tax rate 
realization of the expected benefits will depend on a number of factors  including our future business results and profitability  the effectiveness and timing of our implementation of our international business structure  changes in tax law and the geographic composition of pre tax income 
our operations may be adversely impacted by our exposure to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates 
we market our products in certain foreign markets through our subsidiaries and other international distributors 
the related sales agreements may provide for payments in a foreign currency 
accordingly  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
when the united states dollar weakens against these currencies  the dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense increases  and when the dollar strengthens against these currencies  the dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense decreases 
changes in exchange rates  and in particular a weakening of the united states dollar  may adversely affect our results of operations 
our primary foreign currency exchange rate exposures are with the euro  the japanese yen  the canadian dollar and the australian dollar against the us dollar 
we currently do not hedge against our foreign currency exchange rate risks and therefore believe our exposure to these risks may be higher than if we entered into hedging transactions  including forward exchange contracts or similar instruments 
if we decide in the future to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to attempt to reduce the risk related to foreign currency exchange rates  these contracts may not mitigate the potential adverse impact on our financial results due to the variability of timing and amount of payments under these contracts 
in addition  these types of contracts may themselves cause financial harm to us and have inherent levels of counterparty risk over which we would have no control 
our international operations could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws in non us jurisdictions 
the fcpa and similar worldwide anti bribery laws in non us jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
because of the predominance of government sponsored healthcare systems around the world  many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti bribery laws 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
despite our training and compliance programs  our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents 
violations of these laws  or allegations of such violations  could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of business  financial condition and results of operations 
inadequate levels of coverage or reimbursement from governmental or other third party payers for our products  or for procedures using our products  may cause our revenue to decline 
sales of our products depend in part on the reimbursement and coverage policies of governmental and private health care payers 
the ability of our health care provider customers  including hospitals  to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products  or for the procedures in which our products are used  may impact our customers purchasing decisions 
therefore  our customers inability to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products would have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents third party payers have adopted  and are continuing to adopt  health care policies intended to curb rising health care costs 
these policies include  among others controls on reimbursement for health care services and price controls on medical products and services  limitations on coverage and reimbursement for new medical technologies and procedures  and the introduction of managed care and prospective payment systems in which health care providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed reimbursement amount per person or per procedure 
these trends could lead to pressure to reduce prices for our current products and product candidates and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
legislative and regulatory changes in the health care industry could have a negative impact on our financial performance 
changes in the health care industry in the united states and elsewhere could adversely affect the demand for our products as well as the way in which we conduct our business 
significantly  the new administration and congressional and state leaders have expressed a strong desire to reform the us health care system 
included in this reform could be laws that narrow medicare coverage or reduce reimbursement levels for healthcare services or items provided by physicians and hospitals 
furthermore  many private payors look to medicare s coverage and reimbursement policies in setting their coverage policies and reimbursement amounts such that federal reforms could influence the private sector as well 
finally  many states also may attempt to reform their medicaid programs such that either coverage for certain items or services may be narrowed or reimbursement for them could be reduced 
these healthcare reforms may adversely affect our business 
consistent with or in addition to congressional or state reforms  the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  the federal agency that administers the medicare and medicaid programs could change its current policies that affect reimbursement for our products 
cms determined in that certain uses of pulse oximetry monitoring are eligible for separate medicare payment in the hospital outpatient setting when no separately payable hospital outpatient services are reported on the same date of service 
each year  however  cms re examines the reimbursement rates for hospital inpatient and outpatient and physician office settings and could either increase or decrease the reimbursement rate for procedures utilizing our products overall  we are unable to predict when legislation or regulation that affects our business may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect any such legislation or regulation would have on our business 
any such legislation  regulation or policies that affect the coverage and reimbursement of our current or future products  or the procedures utilizing our current or future products  could cause our sales to decrease and  as a result  our revenue to decline 
in addition  the requirements or restrictions imposed on us or our products may change  either as a result of administratively adopted policies or regulations or as a result of the enactment of new laws 
such changes are particular possibilities in light of the elections in the united states 
there may be heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators and legislators of the fda s device approval process  the agency s efforts to assure the safety of marketed devices  and physician payments and promotional activities by manufacturers 
any new regulations or statutory provisions could result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development  clinical trials  and regulatory review and approval  as well as increased costs to assure compliance 
further  our success in international markets also depends upon the eligibility of reimbursement for our products through government sponsored health care payment systems and other third party payers 
outside of the united states  reimbursement systems vary by country 
these systems are often subject to the same pressures to curb rising health care costs and control health care expenditures as those in the united states 
in addition  as economies of emerging markets develop  these countries may implement changes in their health care delivery and payment systems 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payers outside of the united states are not obtained  sales of our products outside of the united states may be adversely affected 
our ongoing antitrust litigation against tyco healthcare currently covidien could result in significant additional costs and further divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
in may  we filed a lawsuit against tyco healthcare  parent company of nellcor  in the united states district court for the central district of california  alleging damage to our business as a result of the anti competitive business practices of tyco healthcare in connection with its nellcor pulse oximetry brand in violation of federal antitrust laws 
specifically  we alleged that we had incurred damages as a result of a series of illegal exclusionary and anti competitive acts by tyco healthcare that were designed to maintain its monopoly in the pulse oximetry market 
in march  a jury found that tyco healthcare s use of sole source contracts  product bundling and market share based compliance pricing contracts  among other conduct violated the federal antitrust laws and awarded damages on that basis 
tyco healthcare filed post trial motions requesting that the district court either override the jury decision or grant a new trial 
in march  the district court upheld a portion of the jury verdict and vacated the remaining verdict 
in addition  the district court vacated the jury s damages award and granted tyco healthcare a new trial on damages 
after a retrial of damages  on july   the district court entered its final judgment  awarding us damages which were trebled as is mandatory under federal antitrust law to million and denying our 
table of contents request for a permanent injunction with respect to the tyco healthcare business practices found to be anti competitive 
we and tyco healthcare each filed a notice of appeal from the judgment 
we filed our opening brief on december  with the united states court of appeals for the th circuit 
on december   the consumer federation of america and the medical device manufacturers association filed an amicus brief supporting us 
tyco filed its opposition and appeal brief on march  a group of law professors filed an amicus brief supporting tyco on march  we filed our response and reply brief on may  the consumer federation of america and the medical device manufacturers association filed an additional amicus brief in support of us on may  tyco filed its second appeal brief on july  we are seeking reinstatement of the jury s verdict on bundling and an affirmance of the liability findings concerning sole source and market share based compliance contracts 
we are also asking the appellate court to increase the amount of damages awarded by the trial court 
oral argument took place on december  even if we are ultimately awarded damages in this litigation  the amount will be subject to a legal fee contingency agreement  in which case we would receive of the net of costs proceeds from any award 
we believe that covidien continues to enter into sole source contracts  product bundling agreements and market share based agreements 
in bundling agreements  the customer is able to obtain discounts on unrelated products when they purchase covidien pulse oximeters for most of their pulse oximetry needs 
co marketing agreements also provide significant impediments to competition in that covidien pays large patient monitoring companies to integrate covidien pulse oximetry products into their products 
continued litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that would harm our business 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive any cash award or any equitable relief from the litigation 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to raise capital  we may issue additional securities  including shares  debt or equity linked debt  which may dilute our existing stockholders and depress our stock price 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to meet our requirements and cover any losses  we will need to raise additional funds through financings or borrowings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets 
any issuance of equity securities or convertible debt or other equity linked securities to raise financing could cause substantial dilution of the percentage ownership of our security holders at the time of the issuance  cause substantial dilution of our earnings per share  subject us to the risks associated with increased leverage  including a reduction in our ability to obtain financing or an increase in the cost of any financing we obtain  subject us to restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities  and adversely affect the prevailing market price for our outstanding securities 
securities issued in future financings may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock 
these rights  preferences and privileges may include  among others  dividend rights  conversion rights  voting rights and liquidation rights 
as a result  the rights of holders of our common stock will be subject to  and could be adversely affected by  the rights of holders of any preferred stock or other senior securities that may be issued in the future 
we do not intend to seek stockholder approval for any such security issuance unless required by applicable law or regulation or the terms of existing securities 
in addition  any financing may not be on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
if our need for capital arises because of significant losses  the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  or if the funds are not available to us  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products or technologies  take advantage of future opportunities  grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
if we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the securities exchange act of and section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting  our business  results of operations and financial condition and investors confidence in us could be materially and adversely affected 
as a public company  we are required to comply with the periodic reporting obligations of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  including preparing annual reports  quarterly reports and current reports 
our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner and meet our reporting obligations in their entirety could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of the nasdaq stock market  llc  or nasdaq  expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or the sarbanes oxley act  we are required to evaluate and provide a management report of our systems of internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to  our internal control over financial reporting 
we have dedicated  and we expect to continue to dedicate  significant management  financial and other resources in connection with maintaining compliance with section based on the standards adopted by the public company accounting oversight board 
these efforts include reviewing our existing internal control structure and performing system and process evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation 
as a result of these 
table of contents ongoing activities  we may either hire or outsource additional personnel to expand and strengthen our finance function 
in addition  during the course of the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting  we may identify areas requiring improvement and may be required to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review 
this could result in significant delays and costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources  including management time from other activities 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain the certification requirements of section or that our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to provide the attestation report required under the regulations 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the sarbanes oxley act 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud 
our failure to maintain the requirements of section may subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities  including the sec or nasdaq  and sanctions 
as a result  our failure to maintain the requirements of section on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which in turn could harm our business  negatively impact the trading price of our common stock  and adversely affect investors confidence in our company and our ability to access capital markets for financing 
changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may affect how we conduct our business and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices  or the interpretation of them by the sec or other regulatory bodies  can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the adoption of new rules may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
risks related to our common stock our stock price may be volatile  and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities  which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities 
these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
from december  to january   our closing stock price ranged from to 
you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects and other factors 
some specific factors  in addition to the other risk factors identified above  that may have a significant effect on our common stock market price  many of which we cannot control  include but are not limited to actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects  our announcements or our competitors announcements of new products  the public s reaction to our press releases  our other public announcements and our filings with the sec  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  changes in our growth rates or our competitors growth rates  developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors  our inability to raise additional capital as needed  concern as to the efficacy of our products  changes in financial markets or general economic conditions  sales of common stock by us or members of our management team or our board of directors  and changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our common stock  other comparable companies or our industry generally 
in particular  the current decline of the financial markets and related factors beyond our control  including the credit and mortgage crisis in both the us and worldwide  may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly 
concentration of ownership among our existing directors  executive officers and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 

table of contents as of january   our current directors and executive officers and their affiliates  in the aggregate  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other stockholders under delaware law  the stockholders may be able to exercise a significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  and will have some control over our management and policies 
some of these persons or entities may have interests that are different from yours 
for example  these stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree or which are not in your best interests 
the concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of us or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock 
in addition  these stockholders  some of whom have representatives sitting on our board of directors  could use their voting influence to maintain our existing management and directors in office  delay or prevent changes in control of us  or support or reject other management and board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval  such as amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant financing transactions 
you could experience substantial dilution of your investment as a result of subsequent exercises of our outstanding options or the grant of future equity awards by us 
as of january   an aggregate of  shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance under our three equity incentive plans   of which were subject to options outstanding as of that date at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
to the extent outstanding options are exercised  our existing stockholders may incur dilution 
we rely heavily on equity awards to motivate current employees and to attract new employees 
the grant of future equity awards by us to our employees and other service providers may further dilute our stockholders 
future resales of our common stock  including those by our insiders  may cause our stock price to decline 
as of january   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding  including  shares sold by us and  shares sold by our selling stockholders in our initial public offering  or ipo  in august a significant portion of our shares of common stock outstanding prior to our ipo that were not sold by selling stockholders became eligible for sale in the public market on february  upon expiration of lock up agreements entered into in connection with our ipo  although as of january    of these shares were held by directors  executive officers and other affiliates and subject to volume limitations under rule promulgated by the sec under the securities act of  as amended  or rule  as of that date 
a large portion of our outstanding shares are held by a small number of persons and investment funds 
resale by these stockholders of a substantial number of shares  announcements of the proposed resale of substantial amounts of our common stock or the perception that substantial resale may be made  could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock 
moreover  the holders of  shares of common stock at january  have rights  subject to some conditions  to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders from time to time 
certain of our directors and executive officers have entered into rule b trading plans pursuant to which they have sold and will continue to sell shares of our common stock 
generally  these sales require public filings 
actual or potential sales by these insiders  including those under a pre arranged rule b trading plan  could be viewed negatively by the market and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in december  we registered an aggregate of  shares reserved under our equity plans under a registration statement on form s and we anticipate filing one or more additional registration statements on form s to register additional shares reserved under our equity plans 
all shares issued pursuant to a registration statement on form s can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance  subject to restrictions on our affiliates under rule if a large number of these shares are sold in the public market  the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company  prevent attempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable 
for example  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of blank check preferred stock 
as a result  without further stockholder approval  the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights  including voting and dividend rights  to this preferred stock 
with these rights  preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors  whereby directors serve for three year terms  with one third of the directors coming up for reelection each year 
a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest  which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors 
we are also subject to the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law 
under these provisions  if anyone becomes an interested stockholder  we may not enter into a business combination with that person for three years without special approval  which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of us 
an 
table of contents interested stockholder means  generally  someone owning or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years  subject to certain exceptions as described in the delaware general corporation law 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under the stockholder rights plan if any person becomes the beneficial owner of or more of the outstanding shares of common stock  subject to a number of exceptions set forth in the plan  all of our stockholders other than the acquiring person will receive a right to purchase shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
our stockholder rights plan could discourage a takeover attempt and make an unsolicited takeover of our company more difficult 
as a result  without the approval of our board of directors  you may not have the opportunity to sell your shares to a potential acquirer of us at a premium over prevailing market prices 
this could reduce the market price of our common stock 
we will incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company  and our management and key employees will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives 
prior to august  we operated as a private concern 
as a public company  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company 
in addition  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanes oxley act 
these requirements may place a strain on our people  systems and resources 
the exchange act requires that we file annual  quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition 
the sarbanes oxley act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  significant resources and management oversight will be required 
in addition  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including regulations implemented by the sec and nasdaq are creating uncertainty for public companies  increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming 
this may divert management s attention from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our stock  and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock 
we currently intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
any payment of cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  business prospects  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
securities analysts may not cover our common stock or may issue negative reports  which may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock 
if securities analysts do not cover our common stock  the lack of research coverage may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about our business or the pulse oximetry market 
if one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock  our stock price could decline rapidly 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us  we could lose visibility in the market  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  recently adopted rules mandated by the sarbanes oxley act  and a global settlement reached in between the sec  other regulatory agencies and a number of investment banks  has led to a number of fundamental changes in how analysts are reviewed and compensated 
in particular  many investment banking firms are required to contract with independent financial analysts for their stock research 
as long as we have a smaller market capitalization  it may be difficult for us to attract independent financial analysts who will cover our common stock  which could have a negative effect on the market price of our stock

item legal proceedings in may  we filed a lawsuit against tyco healthcare  parent company of nellcor  in the united states district court for the central district of california  alleging damage to our business as a result of the anti competitive business practices of tyco healthcare 
specifically  we alleged that we had incurred damages as a result of a series of illegal exclusionary and anti competitive acts by tyco healthcare that were designed to maintain its monopoly in the pulse oximetry market in violation of federal antitrust laws 
in march  a jury found that tyco healthcare s use of sole source contracts  product bundling and market share based compliance pricing contracts  among other conduct  violated the federal antitrust laws and awarded damages on that basis 
tyco healthcare filed post trial motions requesting that the district court either override the jury decision or grant a new trial 
in march  the district court upheld a portion of the jury verdict and vacated the remaining verdict 
in addition  the district court vacated the jury s damages award and granted tyco healthcare a new trial on damages 
after a retrial of damages  on july   the district court entered its final judgment awarding us damages which were trebled as is mandatory under federal antitrust law to million and denying our request for a permanent injunction with respect to tyco healthcare s business practices found to be anti competitive 
we and tyco healthcare each filed a notice of appeal from the judgment 
we filed our opening brief on december  with the united states court of appeals for the th circuit 
on december   the consumer federation of america and the medical device manufacturers association filed an amicus brief supporting masimo 
tyco filed its opposition and appeal brief on march  and a group of law professors filed an amicus brief supporting tyco on march  we filed our response and reply brief on may  the consumer federation of america and the medical device manufacturers association filed an additional amicus brief in support of us on may  tyco filed its second appeal brief on july  we are seeking reinstatement of the jury s verdict on bundling and an affirmance of the liability findings concerning sole source and market share based compliance contracts 
we are also asking the appellate court to increase the amount of damages awarded by the trial court 
oral argument took place on december  even if we are ultimately awarded damages in this litigation  the amount will be subject to a legal fee contingency agreement  in which case we would receive of the net of costs proceeds from the award 
even though most of the legal expenses to date have been on a contingency basis  we expect to incur expenses related to the appellate work  which will be treated as operating expense  as incurred 
we believe the jury verdict we received in the tyco healthcare antitrust litigation has been important in our efforts to increase our market share among certain large hospital systems and gpos that were formerly closed as a result of tyco healthcare s anti competitive conduct 
however  the lawsuit has been and will continue to be a diversion of management s attention from the implementation of our business strategy

overview we are a global medical technology company that develops  manufactures and markets noninvasive patient monitoring products that improve patient care 
we invented masimo signal extraction technology  or masimo set  which provides the capabilities of measure through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry to address the primary limitations of conventional pulse oximetry 
pulse oximetry is the noninvasive measurement of the oxygen saturation level of arterial blood  or the blood that delivers oxygen to the body s tissues  and pulse rate 
conventional pulse oximetry is subject to technological limitations that reduce its effectiveness and the quality of patient care 
in particular  when using conventional pulse oximetry  arterial blood signal recognition can be distorted by motion artifact  or patient movement  and low perfusion  or low arterial blood flow 
low perfusion can also cause the failure of the conventional pulse oximeter to obtain an accurate measurement 
conventional pulse oximetry readings can also be impacted by bright light and electrical interference from the presence of electrical surgical equipment 
published independent research shows that over of the alarms were false outside the operating room using conventional pulse oximetry 
our masimo set platform has addressed many of the previous technology limitations 
the benefits of masimo set have been validated in over independent clinical and laboratory studies 
during  we generated product revenue of million  representing a compound annual growth rate  or cagr  of for the three years ended january  we develop  manufacture and market a family of noninvasive blood constituent patient monitoring solutions that consists of a monitor or circuit board and our proprietary single patient use and reusable sensors and cables 
in addition  we offer a remote alarm monitoring solution  such as the masimo patient safetynet 
although our masimo set platform is only operable with our proprietary sensors  our sensors have the capability to work with certain competitor pulse oximeters through the use of our adapter cables 
in  we launched our masimo rainbow set pulse co oximetry platform utilizing licensed rainbow technology from masimo labs  which enables the noninvasive measurement of not only arterial blood oxygen saturation level and pulse rate  but also carboxyhemoglobin  or carbon monoxide levels in the blood  methemoglobin saturation levels in the blood and total hemoglobin  or 
table of contents the oxygen carrying component of red blood cells 
also  in we launched plethysmographic variability index  or pvi  which is a measurement that quantifies changes in the plethysmographic waveform over the respiration cycle 
along with the release of our masimo rainbow set pulse co oximetry products  we have developed multi wavelength sensors that have the ability to monitor multiple parameters with a single sensor 
we have focused on building our us and international sales and marketing infrastructure to market our products to end users  such as hospitals  and oem partners for incorporation into their patient monitoring products 
we market our pulse oximetry products to hospitals and the ems market through our direct sales force  and market our circuit boards to our oem partners 
today  the primary focus of our hospital sales force is to facilitate the conversion of hospitals to our masimo set or masimo rainbow set products 
in the united states  we typically enter into long term sales contracts with hospitals  pursuant to which we ship and install our pulse oximeters at no cost to the hospital in exchange for a commitment to purchase a minimum number of sensors from us over a specified period of time 
with the introduction of masimo rainbow set pulse co oximetry  we have established a small sales force to concentrate on the ems market 
over the past year  we have expanded our sales and marketing staffing levels to as of january   from as of december  we supplement our direct sales with sales through our distributors 
during this period  direct and distributor sales have increased to million  or  of product revenue for  from million  or  of product revenue for we expect the percentage of our revenue from direct sales to continue to increase as we expand our worldwide direct sales force 
the building of our installed base of pulse oximeters and pulse oximeter circuit boards generates recurring sales of our sensors  primarily single patient use sensors 
a user of one of our pulse oximeters or our oems pulse oximeters can obtain the benefit of the masimo set or masimo rainbow set only by using our proprietary sensors that are designed for our system 
we currently estimate that our worldwide installed base was approximately  units as of january   up from  units as of december  we estimate our installed base to be the number of pulse oximeters and pulse oximeter circuit boards that we have shipped in the past seven years 
in the event we increase this assessment period beyond seven years in the future  our estimated installed base may increase materially 
we expect our worldwide installed base to continue to increase as we expand our market share and expand the pulse oximetry market to other patient care settings 
on august   we completed our initial public offering  or ipo  of common stock in which a total of  shares were sold  comprised of  shares sold by selling stockholders   shares sold by us at the initial closing and  shares sold by us pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option  at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from the ipo  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and estimated other offering costs of approximately million 
upon the closing of the ipo  all shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended january   including share and per share amounts  include the effects of the offering since it was completed prior to january  masimo laboratories  inc masimo laboratories  inc  or masimo labs  is an independent entity spun off from us to our stockholders in joe e 
kiani and jack lasersohn  members of our board of directors  are also members of the board of directors of masimo labs 
joe e 
kiani  our chairman and chief executive officer  is also the chairman and chief executive officer of masimo labs 
we are a party to a cross licensing agreement with masimo labs  which was amended and restated effective january   or the cross licensing agreement  that governs each party s rights to certain of the intellectual property held by the two companies 
under the cross licensing agreement  we granted masimo labs an exclusive  perpetual and worldwide license  with sublicense rights to use all masimo set owned by us  including all improvements on this technology  for the measurement of non vital signs parameters and to develop and sell devices incorporating masimo set for monitoring non vital signs parameters in any product market in which a product is intended to be used by a patient or pharmacist rather than a professional medical caregiver  which we refer to as the labs market 
we also granted masimo labs a non exclusive  perpetual and worldwide license  with sublicense rights to use all masimo set for the measurement of vital signs in the labs market 
from may through december  masimo labs contracted the services of our employees for the development of rainbow technology 
we paid masimo labs for the option to market and develop products based on masimo labs technology in defined markets 
through december  we had paid masimo labs million in option fees and nearly all these option fees were used by masimo labs to repay us for the services that we had provided to masimo labs 
in addition  through december  we exercised two licenses  for million each  for the right to market products based on the new carbon monoxide and methemoglobin parameter technologies developed by masimo labs 
as of january   the entire million in fees had been used by masimo labs to repay us for the shared engineering and other services that we provided to masimo labs 
we also entered into a services agreement with masimo labs to govern the services we will provide to masimo labs going forward  effective as of january  as part of the cross licensing agreement  we exercised an additional license for total hemoglobin for a fee of million  on january  
table of contents the cross licensing agreement requires us to pay certain royalties on products incorporating the licensed rainbow technology 
the royalty is up to of the rainbow royalty base  which will include handhelds  tabletop and multi parameter devices 
handheld products incorporating rainbow technology will carry a royalty rate 
for other products  only the proportional amount attributable for that portion of our products used to measure non vital sign parameters  sensors and accessories  rather than for measuring vital sign parameters  will be included in the rainbow royalty base 
for multi parameter devices  the rainbow royalty base will include the percentage of the revenues based on the number of rainbow enabled parameters 
beginning in  for hospital contracts where we place equipment and enter into a sensor contract  we will pay a royalty to masimo labs on the total sensor contract revenues based on the ratio of rainbow enabled devices to total devices 
we are also subject to certain specific annual minimum aggregate royalty payments 
these minimum aggregate royalty payments were  for  million for  and million for in and each year thereafter  the minimum aggregate royalty payments are million and million  respectively 
in addition  in connection with a change in control  as defined in the cross licensing agreement  the minimum aggregate annual royalties for all licensed rainbow parameters payable to masimo labs will increase to million and million in and  respectively  and million per year thereafter  and up to million per year for each additional rainbow parameter 
pursuant to fin r  masimo labs is consolidated within our financial statements for all periods presented 
accordingly  all royalties  option and license fees and other charges between us and masimo labs have been eliminated in the consolidation 
also in accordance with fin r  all direct engineering expenses that have been incurred by us and charged to masimo labs have not been eliminated and are included as research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
for additional discussion of masimo labs  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
nellcor patent litigation settlement in october  we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the central district of california against mallinckrodt  inc  now part of covidien formerly tyco healthcare  and one of its subsidiaries  nellcor puritan bennett  inc  collectively referred to as nellcor 
nellcor is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of pulse oximetry products in the world 
the lawsuit was filed for infringement of our pulse oximetry signal processing patents 
nellcor denied our claims and made counterclaims alleging infringement of its patents by us 
this lawsuit resulted in a jury verdict that nellcor had infringed several of our patents  including one of our measure through motion pulse oximeter patents 
in september  the us federal court of appeals ruled that nellcor infringed several masimo patents and ordered the lower court to enjoin nellcor s infringing products 
prior to the issuance of a permanent injunction  nellcor entered into a settlement agreement with us on january   under which we agreed to settle all pending patent litigation with nellcor 
in return  nellcor agreed to pay us million for damages incurred through january we granted nellcor a covenant not to sue on certain new products and nellcor agreed to pay us royalties on its total us pulse oximetry revenue at least through march  in addition  in january  nellcor made an advance royalty payment to us of million for estimated sales of its products in the united states during the remainder of calendar throughout  we received a total of million in cash from nellcor pursuant to the settlement agreement 
we recorded the million lump sum payment as patent litigation proceeds in january and we recognized approximately million of royalty revenue in based on nellcor s total us pulse oximetry revenue as report to us 
we recognize royalty revenue based on the royalty rate per the settlement agreement multiplied by our estimate of nellcor s sales for each quarter 
this estimate is adjusted prospectively when we receive the nellcor royalty report  approximately days after the end of each quarter 
per our settlement agreement  the royalty rate declined significantly from the rates and declined again in however  the rates will remain consistent through march   the remainder of the settlement agreement period  unless nellcor is able to develop new products that avoid some of our current patent coverage as negotiated in the settlement agreement 
cash dividends and special bonus payments in march  we paid a cash dividend of per share  in the aggregate amount of approximately million  to holders of our common and preferred stock  assuming the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into an aggregate of  shares of common stock

in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf   the million in cash dividends have been classified as compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  under cost of goods sold  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in february  we paid additional cash dividends of per share and per share  in the aggregate amount of approximately million  to holders of our common and preferred stock assuming conversion into common stock 
in march and march  we also made special bonus payments in the aggregate amount of approximately million and million  respectively  to our employees and directors who held vested stock options as of march  these cash dividends and special bonus payments were made from the after tax proceeds that we received from our patent infringement lawsuit against nellcor and interest earned thereon 
we do not intend to distribute any future royalties received from nellcor under the settlement agreement to our stockholders or our option holders

total revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended december  product revenue increased million  or  to million in the year ended january   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in our installed base of pulse oximeter circuit boards and pulse oximeters to  units at january   from  units at december  product revenue generated by our direct and distribution sales channels increased million  or  to million from million  while revenues from our oem channel increased million  or  to million from million 
contributing to the year over year increase in product revenues were increased sales of our rainbow products which rose by to million in from in our royalty and license fee revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily due to the expected decline in the royalty rate from to under the terms of our settlement agreement with nellcor 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased million  or to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended december  our gross margin decreased to for the year ended january   from for the year ended december  this decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the expected million decrease in nellcor royalty revenue 
excluding royalties and license fees  product gross profit margins increased by to for the year 
table of contents ended january  from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the impact of increased rainbow products revenues and lower manufacturing costs resulting from the efficiencies derived from higher production levels 
we incurred million and million in masimo lab s royalty expenses for the years ended january  and december   respectively  which  in accordance with fin r  have been eliminated in our consolidated financial results for the periods presented 
had these royalty expenses not been eliminated  our reported product gross profit margin would have been and for the years ended january  and december   respectively 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended december  this increase was mainly due to million of increased payroll and payroll related costs associated with increased research and development staffing levels as total employees rose to at january  from at december  this increase in payroll and payroll related costs were partially offset by a reduction in software costs capitalized of  net of amortization 
share based compensation expense related to sfas r  which is included in payroll and payroll related costs  was million and  for the years ended january  and december   respectively

non operating income 
non operating income declined to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended december  this decline in income was due to the increase in other expense of million for the year ended january   which resulted primarily from million change in foreign currency transaction gain loss 
the foreign currency loss was  during the year ended january   as compared to million of currency gain during the year ended december   resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar as compared to the euro  british pound and australian dollar for most of this increase in other expense was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of million  as a result of the payoff of million in debt during the year ended january  provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million for the year ended january   compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate increased to in from in this increase in tax provision and effective tax rate was due primarily to the implementation of a new international business structure  designed to ultimately align our operations  in a cost efficient manner  with the business needs of our non us customers 
the tax charges related to expenses for sharing in the costs of our ongoing research and development efforts as well as the prepayment of licensing commercial rights to utilize pre existing intangibles 
absent this implementation  our effective tax rate would have been for  that rate being reduced as compared to due primarily to increased research and development related tax credits 
our future effective income tax rate will depend on various factors  including profits losses before taxes  changes to tax law  and the geographic composition of pre tax income

cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased million  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  our gross margin decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this decrease in gross margin was due to the expected decrease in nellcor royalty revenue of million  although partially offset by million of special bonus payments in notwithstanding the nellcor royalty and special bonus payments  the gross margin would have increased by 
during  our product gross margins increased to from in  after adjusting for the special bonus payments 
this increase was primarily due to the impact of increased sales of our rainbow products and lower manufacturing costs resulting from the efficiencies derived from higher production levels 
we incurred million and  in masimo lab s royalty expenses for the years ended december  and december   respectively  which  in accordance with fin r  have been eliminated in our consolidated financial results for the periods presented 
had these royalty expenses not been eliminated  our reported product gross profit margin would have been and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the amount included a charge of million in special bonus payments 
notwithstanding that charge  research and development expenses increased million  mainly due to million of increased payroll and payroll related costs associated with increased research and development staffing levels

selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the amount included a charge of million in special bonus payments 
notwithstanding that charge  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses of million  increased marketing and related expenses of million  increased professional fees of million and million of other expense 
the primary reason for the increased payroll and related expenses was an increase in selling  general and administrative staffing to at december  from at december  increased marketing and related expenses resulted from additional trade show expense of million  higher promotional and sample materials of million  increased customer training activities of million and increased group purchasing organization fees of million

share based compensation expense related to sfas r which is included in payroll and payroll related costs  was million and  for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
non operating income 
non operating income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this change was primarily due to the decrease in interest income of million resulting from lower overall cash levels as compared to average cash levels throughout were higher than due to the investment of patent litigation settlement proceeds and prepaid royalties received in january in addition  other income was million for the year ended december   resulting primarily from foreign currency transaction gains relating to the impact of the strength in the euro and british pound as compared to the us dollar for most of provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decline in provision for income taxes was due primarily to the decline in our taxable income as a result of the one time gain from our patent litigation settlement in our effective tax rate declined to in from in this decline in rate was due to the non deductibility of dividends classified as compensation expense in  which we did not incur in  a reduction of foreign losses not benefited in the us and a reduction in state tax obligations 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
through january   we raised million through seven preferred stock private equity financings  approximately million from our august initial public offering and million from the exercise of stock options  of which million was from exercises after our initial public offering 

table of contents as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  of which million was invested in us treasury bills  million was in money market accounts with major financial institutions and million was in checking accounts and certificates of deposit 
these us treasury bills are classified as cash equivalents since they are highly liquid investments  with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase 
we carry cash equivalents at cost which approximates fair value 
under the terms of our patent litigation settlement with nellcor  nellcor paid us million for damages incurred through january and made an advance royalty payment to us of million related to sales of nellcor s products for the remainder of in total  we have received million in cash from nellcor through december in march and february  we declared dividends in the aggregate amount of approximately million to holders of our common and preferred stock 
in addition  in march and march  we made special bonus payments in the aggregate amount of approximately million to our employees and directors who held vested stock options as of march  the majority of these cash dividends and special bonus payments were made from the after tax proceeds that we received from our settlement with nellcor and interest earned thereon 
in the future  we do not intend to distribute any royalties received from nellcor under the settlement agreement to our stockholders or our option holders 
additionally  in and  we received million and million  respectively  in cash receipts from nellcor for royalties pursuant to our settlement agreement 
the increase in cash received was due to the prepayment of a portion of the royalties actually earned in for further details on the litigation settlement  see business nellcor patent litigation settlement 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in this consists primarily of our net income of million  resulting from continued growth and profitability of our business 
income tax benefit from the exercise of stock options was million  resulting from significant stock option exercises during income taxes payable increased by million as the result of increased operating income and a higher effective tax rate in primarily due to the implementation of a new international business structure 
additionally  share based compensation was million and depreciation and amortization was million in also  other liabilities increased million due to increased unrecognized tax liability 
these increases to cash flow from operating activities were offset by an increase of million in accounts receivable due to business growth which was partially offset by continued improvement in the timing of cash receipts and a million increase in inventory pursuant to our policy of having sufficient inventory to meet customer demand 
cash provided by operating activities was million in this consisted primarily of our net income of million  resulting from overall growth and profitability of our business 
in addition  depreciation and amortization increased to million in due to the purchase of additional fixed assets and deferred revenue increased million in due to continued growth of our business 
these increases to cash flow from operating activities were offset by an increase in royalties receivable of million  related to the timing of nellcor royalty payments which had been prepaid in  but beginning in are paid approximately days after the end of each quarter 
additional offsets included a million increase in inventory pursuant to our policy of having sufficient inventory to meet customer demand  a million increase in deferred cost of goods consistent with the increase in equipment placed at hospitals under long term sensor purchase agreements  and a million increase in accounts receivable due to business growth 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities for was million primarily consisting of million in purchases of property and equipment and for the increase in intangible assets relating primarily to capitalized legal expenses associated with our patent related activities 
the property and equipment purchases included manufacturing equipment and tools of million  leasehold improvements of million and million for additional construction in process  all in order to support the growth of the business 
cash used in investing activities for was million primarily consisting of million in purchases of property and equipment and for the increase in intangible assets relating primarily to capitalized legal expenses associated with patent related activities 
the property and equipment purchases included manufacturing equipment of million and computer hardware and software of million  both in order to support the growth of the business 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash used by financing activities in was million 
this primarily consists of debt repayments of million throughout  including million  or the entire then outstanding balance on one financing arrangement 
this was partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of million and million of excess tax benefit from share based payment arrangements  due to exercises of stock options in unless we obtain additional third party financing  we anticipate that our current debt payments will be minimal in the future 
cash provided by financing activities in was million 
this primarily consists of net proceeds from the initial public offering of million and million in proceeds from long term debt borrowings resulting from financing equipment placed at hospitals under long term sensor purchase agreements 
these sources of funds were partially offset by million of dividends paid and debt repayments throughout of million 
future liquidity needs 
in the future  in addition to funding our working capital requirements  we anticipate our primary use of cash to be the equipment that we provide to hospitals under our long term sensor purchase agreements 
we anticipate additional capital 
table of contents purchases related to expanding our worldwide international operations including manufacturing  sales  marketing and other areas of necessary infrastructure growth 
we also expect to continue to invest in productivity enhancing tools  primarily within our manufacturing and information technology organizations 
our focus on international expansion will also require both continuing and incremental investments in facilities and infrastructure in the americas  europe and asia 
the amount and timing of our actual investing activities will vary significantly depending on numerous factors  such as the progress of our product development efforts  our timetable for international sales operations and manufacturing expansion and both domestic and international regulatory requirements 
despite these capital investment requirements  we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and operations for at least the next months 
current financing arrangements 
as of december   we had two long term borrowings that allowed for the financing of the equipment placed with hospitals in connection with the related long term sensor purchase agreements 
in march  we repaid million  or the entire then outstanding balance  on one of the arrangements 
this is a non recurring event and is not expected to occur in the future 
in addition  we paid  in prepayment fees which are included in other non operating income expense 
therefore  as of january   we had only one remaining financing arrangement with an outstanding balance of  as of january   the total monthly principal and interest payment under this remaining financing agreement was  based on an average interest rate of 
there are no additional amounts available for future borrowing  under this remaining arrangement 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of january   and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our cash liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase commitments capital leases including interest interpretation obligations including interest and penalties total contractual obligations principal and interest payments owed on our equipment financing arrangements 
facility  equipment and automobile leases 
certain inventory items under non cancellable purchase orders to secure better pricing and ensure we will have materials on hand 
leased office equipment 
fin obligations shown in the table above represent uncertain tax positions related to temporary differences 
the years for which the temporary differences related to the uncertain tax positions will reverse have been estimated in scheduling the obligations within the table 
in addition to the interpretation obligations in the table above  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with interpretation  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above  we have also recorded a liability for potential interest of  in addition to these contractual obligations  we have the following annual minimum royalty commitments to masimo labs  as of january  payments due by period less than year years years more than years in thousands minimum royalty commitment to masimo labs subsequent to  the royalty agreement requires a million minimum annual royalty payment unless the agreement is amended  restated or terminated 
pursuant to fin r  masimo labs is consolidated within our financial statements for all periods presented 
accordingly  all inter company royalties  option and license fees and other charges between us and masimo labs have been eliminated in the consolidation 
also in accordance with fin r  all direct engineering expenses that have been incurred by us and charged to masimo labs have not been eliminated and are included as research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
for additional discussion of masimo labs  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents for the foreseeable future  we anticipate that we will continue to be required by fin r to consolidate masimo labs  however  in the event that masimo labs secures additional external financing and or expands its customer base or is no longer financially dependent upon us and we are no longer the primary beneficiary of masimo labs activities  we may be able to discontinue consolidating masimo labs 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses for each reporting period 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and form the basis for making management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventory reserves for excess or obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a standard cost method  which approximates fifo first in  first out 
inventory valuation allowances are recorded for materials that have become obsolete or are no longer used in current production and for inventory that has a market value less than the carrying value in inventory 
we generally purchase raw materials in quantities that we anticipate will be fully used within one year 
however  changes in operating strategy and customer demand  and frequent unpredictable fluctuations in market values for such materials can limit our ability to effectively utilize all of the raw materials purchased and sold through resulting finished goods to customers for a profit 
we regularly monitor potential inventory excess  obsolescence and lower market values compared to standard costs and  when necessary  reduce the carrying amount of our inventory to its market value 
specific reserves are maintained to reduce the carrying value of inventory items on hand that we know may not be used in finished goods 
a general inventory reserve is also maintained based on our estimate of future limitations on our ability to utilize the inventory on hand 
our inventory reserves were million and million at january  and december   respectively 
if our estimates for potential inventory losses are low  our earnings will be affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net estimated realizable value 
we rely on prior experience to estimate the amount that we expect to collect on the gross receivables outstanding  which cannot be known with exact certainty as of the time of issuance of this report 
we maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to customer liquidity issues 
we also maintain a general allowance for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate an inability  but may be unable  to pay 
although such losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past  especially given the recent deterioration of the credit markets of the worldwide economy 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable balance  including those from related parties was million and million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million at january  and december   respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts declined due to an improvement in the aging of customer receivables at the end of as compared to the end of share based payment we have historically issued stock options to reward our employees and directors 
prior to december   we accounted for these option grants under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and applied the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
this accounting treatment resulted in a pro forma stock option expense that was estimated and reported in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for those years 

table of contents for option grants made on or prior to december   we recorded stock based compensation  typically associated with options granted to non employees or directors based upon the difference  if any  between the estimated fair value of common stock underlying the options on the date of grant and the option exercise price 
the fair value of the common stock for options granted prior to december  was originally estimated solely by our board of directors  with input from management 
we believe the members of our board of directors have extensive experience in the medical device market and many of our directors were accredited venture capital investors 
for grants made prior to december   we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist 
since there was no public market for our shares  our board of directors exercised judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several objective and subjective factors  including our operating and financial performance  corporate milestones  product development and market acceptance  the superior rights and preferences of our convertible preferred stock and the risk and non liquid nature of our common stock 
for grants made after december  and prior to our initial public offering  our board of directors also relied on valuations performed by an unrelated valuation specialist 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment using the prospective method  which requires us to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  relating to sfas no 
r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in the adoption of sfas no 
r for and in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  relating to sfas no 
r 
beginning in january  we applied the provisions of sab effective january   the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants year ended january  year ended december  year ended december  risk free interest rate to to to expected term years to years years years estimated volatility to to to expected dividends the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  including fair value  expected term  expected volatility  expected dividends  risk free interest rate  and expected pre vesting forfeiture rate to calculate the fair value of share based payment awards 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of our stock options 
the estimated pre vesting forfeiture rate is based on our historical experience and the composition of option plan participants  among other factors  and reduces the compensation expense recognized 
if the actual forfeitures differ from the estimates  adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
during the year ended december  and the nine months ended september   we did not have sufficient information available which was indicative of future exercise and post vesting behavior to estimate the expected term 
as a result  we adopted the simplified method of estimating the expected term of a stock option  as permitted by sab under this method  the expected term is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the contractual end of the term 
the use of the simplified method requires our option plan to be consistent with a plain vanilla plan 
subsequent to september   we had sufficient company specific and available external information to estimate our expected term and therefore we did not rely on the simplified method 
as we obtain more historical data as a publicly traded company  we expect to rely increasingly on company specific information for our estimate of expected term 
additionally  during the year ended december  and the nine months ended september   we did not have sufficient information available regarding the historic volatility for our shares 
as a result  we estimated volatility based on a peer group of companies  which collectively provides a reasonable basis for estimating volatility 
subsequent to september  and after we had been publicly traded for more than one year  we were able to use company specific as well as peer group information to estimate the volatility of our shares 
as we obtain more historical data as a publicly traded company  we expect to rely increasingly on company specific information for our estimate of volatility 
we do not expect to declare dividends in the future 
as part of a one time patent settlement  our board of directors declared a dividend in march and declared two dividends in december these dividends were declared only due to the receipt of settlement proceeds in connection with patent infringement litigation with nellcor 
absent this settlement and the corresponding receipt of settlement proceeds  we would not have declared and paid any of these dividends 

table of contents share based payment expense related to the adoption of sfas r amounted to million for the year ended january  and million for the year ended december  we expect share based payment expense to increase significantly in future years as we intend to continue to grant stock options to both new and existing employees and directors consistent with our stock option policy 
the fair market value of our common stock may also increase the cost of future stock option grants in the future 
to the extent that the fair market value of our common stock increases  the overall cost of granting these options will also increase 
for further details regarding our share based compensation see note of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our combined consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
at january   we have million of net operating loss carryforwards from our foreign jurisdictions which begin to expire in and million of net operating losses from various states  which begin to expire in we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to foreign and state net operating losses will not be realized 
a valuation allowance has been provided on such loss carryforwards 
under fin r  our consolidated income tax provision or benefit and the net deferred tax assets include masimo labs income taxes provision or benefit and deferred tax assets 
for income tax purposes  masimo labs is not a member of our consolidated group and files its separate federal and california income tax returns 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which became effective on january  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the adoption of fin resulted in a reduction of our beginning retained earnings as of january  of  as of january  and december   the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits was million and million  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks that may arise from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange fluctuations and inflation 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to our various outstanding debt instruments 
our risk associated with fluctuation to interest expense is limited to our outstanding financing arrangements  which have fixed interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point drop in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at january  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income and expense while increases in interest rates will increase our interest income and expense 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a majority of our assets and liabilities are maintained in the united states in us dollars and a majority of our sales and expenditures are transacted in us dollars 
however  certain of our foreign subsidiaries transact in their respective country s local currency  which is also their functional currency 
as a result  revenues and expenses of these foreign subsidiaries when converted into us dollars can vary depending on average monthly exchange rates during a respective period 
intercompany transactions of certain of our foreign subsidiaries with masimo corporation are denominated in us dollars and are considered foreign currency denominated transactions by the subsidiary 
in addition  any other transactions between masimo corporation or its subsidiaries and a third party  denominated in a currency different from the functional currency  is a foreign currency transaction 
realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses on these transactions are included in our statements of income as incurred and are converted to us dollars at average exchange rates for a respective period 
the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the statements of income and cash flows are translated into us dollars using the average monthly exchange rate during the period 
any foreign exchange gain or loss as a result of translating the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our primary foreign currency exchange rate exposures are with the euro  the japanese yen  the canadian dollar and the australian dollar against the us dollar 
we currently do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material effect on our future operating results or cash flows  depending on which foreign currency exchange rates change and depending on the directional change either a strengthening or weakening against the us dollar 
as our foreign operations continue to grow  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may become more significant 

table of contents inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations during the periods presented  and we do not anticipate that it will have a material adverse effect in the future
