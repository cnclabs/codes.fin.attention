the company adjusts the nareit definition to add back minority interests in the operating partnership 
ffom adds back to traditionally defined ffo non cash amortization of non real estate related intangible assets associated with purchase accounting 
the company presents ffo and ffom because it considers them important supplemental measures of operational performance 
the company believes ffo is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo and ffom do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo and ffom should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance  nor are they indicative of funds available to fund its cash needs  including its ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents the reconciliation of ffo and ffom to net income loss  which is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo and ffom in thousands company predecessor for the year ended for the year ended for the year ended november  january  for the year ended december  december  december  december  october  december  funds from operations net income loss minority interests in operating partnership real estate related depreciation and amortization gain on sale of real estate properties funds from operations amortization of intangibles related to purchase accounting  net of income tax benefit funds from operations modified real estate depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization from wholly owned real estate properties and the company s share of real estate depreciation and amortization from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships

overview the company is a fully integrated  self administered  and self managed reit that invests in specialty office buildings for the medical profession  including medical offices and ambulatory surgery and diagnostic centers 
the company focuses on the ownership  development  redevelopment  acquisition  and management of strategically located medical office buildings and other healthcare related facilities in the united states of america 
the company provides services from strategic planning to long term property ownership and management 
integrated delivery service offerings include architecture  engineering  construction and capital project development 
the company has been built around understanding and addressing the specialized real estate needs of the healthcare industry 
on march   the company acquired erdman 
erdman is a leading design builder of healthcare facilities with specialized expertise and concentration in high growth healthcare market segments and facility types 
erdman has successfully cultivated a client mix that is diversified in both geography and market focus and includes physician group practices and healthcare systems 
erdman was ranked as the number one healthcare design build firm for by modern healthcare s construction and design survey 
as of december   the company has completed the integration process with erdman 
the combination is transformative for the company creating a national  fully integrated healthcare facilities company 
the million erdman transaction was financed through million of assumed cash  a million term loan  a million  inclusive of escrow amount  rollover of equity held by erdman shareholders and members of its management team  and million  inclusive of escrow amount in cash  from the company s million secured credit facility 
in addition to the erdman equity rollover  the company completed two offerings of common stock during the first  a private placement completed in january  raised million  after costs  and the second  a public offering completed in september  raised million  after costs 
the net proceeds from these offerings were used to reduce outstanding principal on the credit facility and for working capital purposes 
the company acquired two off market properties in  totaling million  which were the result of strong relationships with existing clients 
the company completed one development project during  with a total investment of approximately million  and has three projects under construction with an expected total investment of approximately million 
one of the projects under construction is the woodlands center for specialized medicine 
this project  located in pensacola  florida  is the first project utilizing the company s integrated delivery model 
the company s strategic planning team worked with the client to develop a comprehensive strategy to meet the client s healthcare delivery needs 
the company s capital team worked with the client to determine the optimum ownership and financing strategy to meet their needs 
upon completion  the company will be the consolidating joint venture partner and the building s physician tenants will be the limited partners 
erdman is providing project delivery services  including development  design  and construction 
cogdell spencer advisors  a subsidiary of the operating partnership  is the property manager for the building 
during  the company formed a joint venture with northwestern mutual 
the joint venture  cogdell spencer medical partners llc  may acquire up to approximately million of medical office buildings and other healthcare facilities nationwide  predominantly associated with not for profit healthcare systems and large physician owned clinics 
the joint venture will be the company s exclusive vehicle for cash acquisitions 
when the joint venture closes on a specific acquisition  the company will contribute of the equity capital to fund the acquisition 
the company expects the joint venture will obtain mortgage financing on market terms for its acquisitions  which mortgage financing may come from the joint venture partner 
as of december   the joint venture did not have any acquisitions under contract that the company expects to go forward 
the company derives a majority of its revenues from two sources rents received from tenants under existing leases in mobs and other healthcare related facilities  and from design build services for healthcare customers 
the company expects that rental revenue will remain stable due to multi year  non cancellable leases with annual rental increases based on cpi 
the company s design build revenue is derived from its erdman subsidiary 
the demand for erdman s services has been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature 
in periods of adverse economic conditions  erdman s customers may be unwilling or unable to make capital expenditures  and they may be unable to obtain debt or equity financings for projects 
as a result  customers may defer projects to a later date  which could reduce erdman s revenues 
due to the current economic environment and the volatility in the credit markets  erdman is experiencing delays in client project starts and cancellations 
as a result  the company expects its design build revenue in to be less than revenue 
as a result  the company implemented a cost reduction program and in december  erdman effected a reduction in force in order to right size the organization for contracted revenues and eliminated approximately jobs 
generally  the company s property operating revenues and expenses have remained consistent over time except for growth due to property and business acquisitions 
erdman s financial results can be affected by the amount and timing of capital spending by healthcare systems and providers  the demand for erdman s services in the healthcare facilities market  the availability of construction level financing  and weather at the construction sites 
deterioration of market or economic conditions and volatility in the financial market can influence future revenues  interest and other costs  and could result in future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
as of december   the company owned and or managed medical office buildings and healthcare related facilities  totaling million net rentable square feet and serving hospital systems in states 
the company s portfolio consists of properties  comprised of million net rentable square feet  each of which the company wholly owns or is a consolidated real estate partnership  three properties  comprised of million net rentable square feet  in which the company owns a minority interest  and properties  comprised of million net rentable square feet  that the company manages for third parties 
as of december   of the company s wholly owned properties  were located on hospital campuses and an additional were located off campus  but were hospital anchored 
the company believes that its on campus and hospital anchored assets occupy a premier franchise location in relation to local hospitals  providing the company s properties with a distinct competitive advantage over alternative medical office space in an area 
as of december   the company s in service  consolidated wholly owned and joint venture properties were approximately occupied  with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately years 
one property was in lease up at december  critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with gaap 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation and combination 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
the company s actual results may differ from these estimates 
management has provided a summary of the company s significant accounting policies in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies are those judged to involve accounting estimates or assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters or susceptibility of such matters to change 
other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of the company s results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
acquisition of real estate the price that the company pays to acquire a property is impacted by many factors  including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  above or below market ground leases and numerous other factors 
accordingly  the company is required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the company s estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to the company 
each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
the company s calculation methodology is summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on the company s results of operations because if the company were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if the company were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of value or negative value assigned to above or below market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in the company s consolidated and combined statements of operations 
acquisition of business the price that the company pays to acquire a business is impacted by many factors  including projected future cash flows  customer lists  contracts and proposals  trade names and trademarks  condition of property  plant  and equipment  and numerous other factors 
accordingly  the company is required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in business among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the company s estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of contacts  proposals  customer lists  workforce  trade names and trademarks  receivables  accruals and reserves  and property  plant  and equipment 
each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
the company s calculation methodology is summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on the company s results of operations because if the company were to allocate more value to goodwill or a non amortizing intangible asset there would be no amortization with respect to such amount or if the company were to allocate more value to a longer lived asset as opposed to allocating to shorter lived asset  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a longer period of time 
useful lives of assets the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the company s properties and intangible assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation and amortization to record on an annual basis with respect to the company s assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income loss because if the company were to shorten the expected useful lives  then the company would depreciate or amortize such assets over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation or amortization expense on an annual basis 
asset impairment valuation the company reviews the carrying value of its properties and amortizing intangible assets when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate a potential impairment may exist 
the company bases its review on an estimate of the future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate or business investment s use and eventual disposition 
the company considers factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if the company s evaluation indicates that it may be unable to recover the carrying value of an investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
these losses have a direct impact on the company s net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to operating results 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future sales  backlog  occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
because cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  the company s strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss for properties 
if the company s strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if the company determines that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
the company estimates the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 
the company reviews the value of goodwill assets using an income approach and market approach on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist 
no impairment losses have been recognized to date 
the company s methodology to review goodwill impairment  which includes a significant amount of judgment and estimates  provides a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment has occurred 
however  many of the factors employed in determining whether or not goodwill is impaired are outside of the company s control and it is likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments 
the goodwill impairment review involved a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
fair value was estimated by using two approaches  an income approach and a market approach 
each approach was weighted in the company s analysis 
the income approach uses the reporting unit s projected operating results and discounted cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the cash flow projections use estimates of economic and market information over the projection period  including growth rates in revenues and costs and estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures  and changes in future working capital requirements 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and profitability characteristics 
additionally  the company reconciles the total of the estimated fair values of all its reporting units to its market capitalization to determine if the sum of the individual fair values is reasonable compared to the external market indicators 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  then an indication of impairment may exist and a second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill calculated in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  then an impairment charge for the difference would be recorded 
for non amortizing intangible assets  the company estimates fair value by applying an estimated market royalty rate to projected revenues and discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate and cause declines in the company s stock price  increases the estimated weighted average cost of capital  changes in cash flow multiples or projections  or changes in other inputs to goodwill assessment estimates  then a goodwill impairment review may be required prior to the company s next annual test 
it is reasonably possible that changes in the numerous variables associated with the judgments  assumptions  and estimates could cause the goodwill or non amortizing intangible assets to become impaired 
if goodwill or non amortizing intangible assets are impaired  the company would be required to record a non cash charge that could have a material adverse affect on its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental income related to non cancelable operating leases is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases 
deferred rents included in the company s consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the rental revenue that would be recognized under the cash flow received  based on the terms of the leases 
the company s leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for all property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by the company 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized when the related leases are canceled and the company has no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
as discussed above  the company recognizes amortization of the value of acquired above or below market tenant leases as a reduction of rental income in the case of above market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below market leases 
for design build contracts  the company recognizes revenue under the percentage of completion method 
due to the volume  varying complexity  and other factors related to the company s design build contracts  the estimates required to determine percentage of completion are complex and use subjective judgments 
changes in labor costs and material inputs can have a significant impact on the percentage of completion calculations 
the company and erdman have a long history of developing reasonable and dependable estimates related to design build contracts with clear requirements and rights of the parties to the contracts 
as long term design build projects extend over one or more years  revisions in cost and estimate earnings during the course of the work are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts which require the revision become known 
at the time a loss on a design build project becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the company receives fees for property management and development and consulting services from time to time from third parties which are reflected as fee revenue 
management fees are generally based on a percentage of revenues for the month as defined in the related property management agreements 
revenue from development and consulting agreements is recognized as earned per the agreements 
due to the amount of control retained by the company  most joint venture developments will be consolidated  therefore  those development fees will be eliminated in consolidation 
however  the joint venture with northwestern mutual  cogdell spencer medical partners llc  is an unconsolidated entity 
other income shown in the statement of operations generally includes interest income  primarily from the amortization of unearned income on a sales type capital lease recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and other income incidental to the company s operations and is recognized when earned 
the company must make subjective estimates as to when the company s revenue is earned and the collectibility of the company s accounts receivable related to design build contracts and other sales  minimum rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant and customer concentrations  tenant and customer creditworthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
reit qualification requirements the company is subject to a number of operational and organizational requirements to qualify and then maintain qualification as a reit 
if the company does not qualify as a reit  its income would become subject to us federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates that would be substantial and the company cannot re elect to qualify as a reit for four taxable years following the year it failed to quality as a reit 
the resulting adverse effects on the company s results of operations  liquidity and amounts distributable to stockholders would be material 
changes in financial condition on january   the company issued  shares of common stock to certain institutional investors at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
on september   the company issued  shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
the net proceeds of both offerings were used to reduce outstanding principal on the company s credit facility and for working capital purposes 
for more information on the credit facility  see liquidity and capital resources 
as discussed in note and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company completed the merger with erdman  amended the credit facility  and obtained million in term debt 
results of operations the company s loss from operations is generated primarily from operations of its properties and design build services 
the changes in operating results from period to period reflect changes in existing property performance  changes in the number of properties due to the development  acquisition  or disposition of properties  and the operating results of the design build segment 
the company acquired erdman in march and results for the year ended december   reflect ten months of operating activity related to the erdman subsidiary  reflecting operations from the acquisition date to year end 
business segments the company has two identified reportable segments property operations and design build and development 
the company defines business segments by their distinct customer base and service provided 
each segment operates under a separate management group and produces discrete financial information  which is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make resource allocation decisions and assess performance 
for additional information  see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

long term liquidity needs the company s principal long term liquidity needs consist primarily of new property development  property acquisitions  and principal payments under various mortgages and other credit facilities and non recurring capital expenditures 
the company does not expect that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet all of these long term liquidity needs 
instead  the company expects to finance new property developments through modest cash equity capital contributed by the company together with construction loan proceeds  as well as through cash equity investments by its tenants or third parties 
the company expects to fund property acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under its credit facility and traditional secured mortgage financing 
in addition  the company expects to use op units issued by the operating partnership to acquire properties from existing owners seeking a tax deferred transaction 
although capital markets continued to remain tight during and into the first quarter of  the company continues to expect to meet long term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and  to the extent possible and desirable  through additional equity and debt financings  including loans from banks  institutional investors or other lenders  bridge loans  letters of credit  and other lending arrangements  most of which will be secured by mortgages 
notwithstanding the company s expectations discussed above  financial markets continue to experience unusual volatility and uncertainty 
financial systems throughout the world have become illiquid with banks no longer willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and borrowers 
consequently  there is greater uncertainty regarding the company s ability to access the credit market in order to attract financing or capital on reasonable terms or on any terms 
the company may also issue unsecured debt in the future 
however  with the current deteriorating general economic conditions and the current volatility of the debt and equity markets  there can be no assurance as to the company s ability to raise new debt or equity 
the company does not  in general  expect to meet its long term liquidity needs through dispositions of its properties 
in the event that the company were to sell any of its properties in the future  depending on which property were to be sold  the company may need to structure the sale or disposition as a tax deferred transaction which would require the reinvestment of the proceeds from such transaction in another property or  however  the proceeds that would be available to the company from such sales may be reduced by amounts that the company may owe under the tax protection agreements entered into in connection with the company s formation transactions and certain property acquisitions 
in addition  the company s ability to sell certain of its assets could be adversely affected by the general illiquidity of real estate assets and certain additional factors particular to the company s portfolio such as the specialized nature of its target property type  property use restrictions and the need to obtain consents or waivers of rights of first refusal or rights of first offers from ground lessors in the case of sales of its properties that are subject to ground leases 
the company intends to repay indebtedness incurred under its credit facility from time to time  for acquisitions or otherwise  out of cash flow from operations and from the proceeds  to the extent possible and desirable  of additional debt or equity issuances 
in the future  the company may seek to increase the amount of the credit facility  negotiate additional credit facilities or issue corporate debt instruments 
however  with the current volatility in the debt markets  there can be no assurance as to the company s ability to raise new debt 
any indebtedness incurred or issued by the company may be secured or unsecured  short  medium or long term  fixed or variable interest rate and may be subject to other terms and conditions the company deems acceptable 
the company intends to refinance at maturity the mortgage notes payable that have balloon payments at maturity

real estate taxes the company s leases generally require the tenants to be responsible for all real estate taxes 
inflation the company s leases at wholly owned and consolidated partnership properties generally provide for either indexed escalators  based on the cpi or other measures or  to a lesser extent  fixed increases in base rents

these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  the company may take actions to further mitigate the company s exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in the company s financial structure
