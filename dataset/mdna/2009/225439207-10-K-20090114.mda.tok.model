item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations summary during  the company s operations were focused on its two core projects drilling in the mid continent area of the us and application of its calliope gas recovery system 
during the past several years  the company has significantly expanded the volume and breadth of its drilling activities by diversifying geographically  scientifically  and in terms of capital  risk and reserve potential 
the company has also implemented a program to increase the volume of its calliope applications by joint venturing with other companies 
these activities are discussed in greater detail below 
the company believes that  in combination  its drilling and calliope projects provide an excellent and possibly unique balance for achieving its goal of adding long lived oil and natural gas reserves and production at reasonable costs and risks 
however  it should be expected that successful results will occur unevenly for both the drilling and calliope projects 
drilling results are dependent on both the timing of drilling and on the drilling success rate 
calliope results are primarily dependent on the timing  volume and quality of calliope installations available to the company 
the company will continue to actively pursue adding reserves through its two core projects in fiscal  and expects these activities to be a reliable source of reserve additions 
however  the timing and extent of such activities can be dependent on many factors which are beyond the company s control  including but not limited to  the availability of oil field services such as drilling rigs  production equipment and related services  and access to wells for application of the company s patented gas recovery system on low pressure gas wells 
the prevailing price of oil and natural gas has a significant effect on demand and  thus  the related cost of such services and wells 
during the year  the company experienced delays in securing delivery of production equipment  primarily compressors and coil tubing 
these delays extended the time to conduct field operations in general  and in particular related to installations of calliope systems 
results of operations in  oil and gas revenues increased to  compared to  in the increase was due to a increase in oil prices and a increase in gas prices excluding realized derivative gains and losses partially offset by a decrease in gas equivalent production

the company s earnings before unrealized gains losses on derivative contracts  interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization  ebitda was  for the year ended october  and  for the prior year 
ebitda is not a gaap measure of operating performance 
the company uses this non gaap performance measure primarily to compare its performance with other companies in the industry that make a similar disclosure 
the company believes that this performance measure may also be useful to investors for the same purpose 
investors should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
in addition  because ebitda is not a gaap measure  it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
a reconciliation between ebitda and net income is provided in the table below for the year ended october  reconciliation of ebitda net income add back deduct interest expense income tax expense depreciation  depletion and amortization expense ebitda the average return  loss  on the company s investments for the year ended october  and was a loss of and a gain of  respectively 
at october   approximately of the investments consist primarily of professionally managed limited partnerships which include investments that are not publicly traded and may have less readily determinable market values 
the company is in the process of liquidating these investments 
remaining investments are directly invested in mutual funds and were managed by professional money managers 
most of the investments 
table of contents are liquid and the company believes they represent a responsible approach to cash management 
in the company s opinion  the greatest investment risk is the potential for negative market impact from unexpected  major adverse news 
existing working capital and anticipated cash flow are expected to be sufficient to fund operations and capital requirements for at least the next months 
at october   the company had no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements except for the hedging line of credit discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
because earnings are anticipated to be reinvested in operations  cash dividends are not expected to be paid 
the company has no defined benefit plans and no obligations for post retirement employee benefits 
as of october   the company had the following known contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years exclusive license obligation operating lease obligations total subsequent to october   the company purchased the patents underlying the license agreement and eliminated this commitment 
impact of current credit markets as the company exited the fourth quarter of fiscal  oil and natural gas prices had declined sharply from their recent record levels 
in addition  recent problems in the credit markets  steep stock market declines  financial institution failures and government bail outs provide evidence of a weakening united states and global economy 
as a result of the market turmoil and price decreases  oil and gas companies with high debt levels and lack of liquidity have been and will continue to be negatively impacted 
however  the company does not expect to be significantly impacted by these recent events 
the company has no debt and is in a financially strong position due to its past strategies 
the company anticipates its cash on hand and operating cash flow will adequately fund planned capital expenditures and other capital uses over the near term 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements at october  product prices and production refer to item  markets and customers  for discussion of oil and gas prices and marketing 

table of contents oil and natural gas sales volume and price realization comparisons for the indicated years ended october are set forth below

although product prices are key to the company s ability to operate profitably and to budget capital expenditures  they are beyond the company s control and are difficult to predict 
since  the company has periodically hedged the price of a portion of its estimated natural gas production when the potential for significant downward price movement is anticipated 
derivative transactions typically take the form of forward short positions and collars on the nymex futures market  and are closed by purchasing offsetting positions 
the company has elected not to designate its commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  such contracts are recorded at fair value on its balance sheet and changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as they occur 
open derivative contracts at october  are indexed to the nymex and are represented by short positions 
actual price realizations in the company s principal areas of operations primarily oklahoma are expected to be to below nymex prices primarily due to basis differentials 
however  regional weather conditions and other economic factors  such as the current delay in completion of the eastern extension of the rocky mountain express gas pipeline  resulting in excess natural gas supplies to the mid continent region  can periodically result in substantially higher basis differentials 
at october   the oklahoma basis differential was of the nymex price 
the company has a hedging line of credit with its bank which is available  at the discretion of the company  to meet margin calls 
to date  the company has not used this facility and maintains it only as a precaution related to possible margin calls 
the maximum credit line available is  with interest calculated at the prime rate 
the facility is unsecured and has covenants that require the company to maintain  in cash or short term investments  none of which are required to be maintained at the company s bank  and prohibits funded debt in excess of  the line expires november  
table of contents oil and gas activities capital spending 
capital spending in totaled  consisting primarily of additions to oil and gas properties 
subsequent to fiscal year end  the company purchased all of the calliope gas recovery system patents and all of the remaining third party right  title and interest in the calliope technology 
in addition  the company purchased all of the patents for its new tractor seal fluid lift technology together with all third party right  title and interest in the technology the tractor seal technology is currently in the development state and  except for the patents  the company has not yet provided public disclosure regarding the technology 
the total purchase price was  drilling activities northern anadarko basin the company owns a significant inventory of acreage approximately  gross acres located along the northern portion of the anadarko basin where it conducts an active drilling program 
wells generally target the morrow  oswego and chester formations between  and  feet 
the company expects to drill a substantial number of additional wells on this acreage 
during the year  the company drilled thirteen wells on its oklahoma properties 
of those  eleven are producers and two were dry holes 
subsequent to fiscal year end  the company drilled three wells in oklahoma  all of which appear to be commercial producers 
during the final hour test  a new deeper pool discover well on the company s  gross acre pool proffitt prospect produced oil and gas at high rates from the hunton formation with virgin pressure 
electric logs and drilling and completion data indicate that the chester and mississippian formations are also productive in the well 
however  completion of the up hole zones will be delayed in order to more fully evaluate the hunton zone potential 
the company owns a working interest and is the operator 
about one mile to the north on the pool proffitt prospect  another well is currently being completed in the mississippian and chester formations 
the company owns a working interest and is the operator 
a third well is currently being completed for production in carter county in which the company owns a working interest 
the new well will develop two deeper deese formation oil sands and the woodford formation  both of which electric logs indicate are productive 
in southern oklahoma  the company is participating in three waterflood projects as part of its overall strategy to improve the oil ratio in its reserve base 
in carter county  credo owns of the southeast hewitt waterflood unit which has already produced  barrels of oil 
the company also owns about in phase  and in phase  of a twin forks deese sand waterflood unit that has recently been formed 
in love county  credo owns in phase  and in phase  of the eastman hills waterflood unit that is installed and operational 
in hemphill county  texas  the company has purchased interests in over  gross acres and has taken over as operator of wells 
the new acreage complements the company s existing prospect acreage and brings its total acreage in the area to approximately  gross acres 
south texas in south texas  the initial test well on the gemini prospect resulted in a dry hole 
the  foot well confirmed the seismic interpretation and found porous sand 
however  the sand was water wet and the well was plugged and abandoned 
credo received approximately  of cash for the multiple prospect package and retained an carried interest in the test well 
the prospect package consists of two additional deep wilcox prospects located north of the gemini prospect 
these two prospects are structurally different and unique compared to the gemini prospect 
those prospects are being further evaluated  and if drilled  credo will have an carried interest in the first well 
elsewhere in south texas  the company has purchased a working interest in the escobas field 
a new  foot wilcox well has been drilled in which the company has a small carried interest 
that well is currently producing mmcfd million cubic of gas per day on a ths choke 
central kansas uplift the company further expanded the volume and breadth of its exploration program with a new drilling project in central kansas and nebraska 
the project provides 
table of contents diversification to the company s drilling program geographically and scientifically through the use of d seismic to identify shallow oil prospects 
the acreage is located in prolific oil producing areas where d seismic has proven effective in identifying satellite structures near mature producing fields 
higher oil prices have justified using d seismic technology to locate undrilled structures that are very difficult to find with old technology 
drilling targets the lansing kansas city and arbuckle formations at about  feet and  compared to the company s northern anadarko basin and south texas projects  is relatively low cost  low risk  and exclusively targets oil reserves in an effort to bring better product balance to the company s reserve base 
the company has assembled about  gross  net acres and is continuing to seek opportunities to increase its exposure to the play 
the company owns working interests in the existing prospects ranging from to 
the company s recent drilling results have improved significantly as it continues to find the keys to successful seismic and geologic interpretation 
at october   the company has participated in drilling a total of wells on the acreage  of which have been successfully completed as oil producers 
well depths range from  to  feet and drilling costs are moderate 
the company has recently drilled a wildcat well on a  gross acre seismically defined prospect 
production pipe has been set through the lansing kansas city formation 
the well is classified as a tight hole  meaning that detailed information is not being released for proprietary business reasons 
credo owns an working interest in the prospect and is the operator 
development drilling is scheduled 
north dakota during the company expanded its exploration program into north dakota and acquired approximately  gross acres  net in the fort berthold indian reservation area of the bakken shale play 
calliope gas recovery technology calliope s track record the company s current compilation of calliope s track record shows calliope installations on wells located in oklahoma  texas and louisiana 
the calliope wells produce from both sandstone and carbonate reservoirs including the chester  cotton valley  edwards  hart  hunton  morrow  nodosaria  redfork and springer formations 
the calliope wells range in depth from  to  feet 
these wells represent rigorous applications for calliope because at the time calliope was installed  of the wells were dead an average of two to three years  nine were uneconomic and two were marginal 
in addition  prior to the time calliope was installed  many of the reservoirs were damaged by the parting shots of previous operators 
twenty three of the wells were acquired from other operators after the operators had given up on these wells 
the previous operators were mostly medium to large independent oil and gas companies 
initial calliope production rates range up to mcfd and average per well calliope reserves for non experimental wells are estimated to be bcf 
one of the company s early calliope installations  the jc carroll well  has now produced over billion cubic feet of gas using calliope 
the calliope applications are grouped into two categories experimental wells and non experimental wells  also referred to as go forward applications 
eleven of the wells are experimental applications and are go forward applications 
experimental wells generally represent the first experimental application of a calliope configuration in a wellbore 
for example  the first installation of calliope inside a particular tubing size is classified as an experimental application 
calliope has achieved compelling results on these less than ideal wells 
for example  the entire group of non experimental wells were producing a total of only mcfd when calliope was installed 
without calliope  the wells represented a substantial plugging liability 
however  with calliope  those same wells have now produced an approximate incremental bcfe to date  and they are still producing substantial quantities of gas 
with calliope and depending on natural gas prices at the time gas is produced  the wells are projected to have estimated ultimate incremental calliope reserves ranging from to bcfe depending primarily on the effect that natural gas prices have on well economics 

table of contents calliope has proven to be a low risk and low cost liquid lift technology 
the average cost of a calliope system is  for a  foot application 
based on average per well calliope reserves of bcfe for go forward applications  cost of calliope in terms of units of natural gas reserves added is low compared to industry averages 
based on current natural gas prices  calliope can economically be installed on wells which will yield significantly less than bcf of calliope reserves 
this will enable the company to significantly expand the range of calliope applications to include many low permeability reservoirs  possibly including those in shale and other resource plays 
realizing calliope s value continues to be one of the company s top priorities 
the company has been focused on three fronts to increase the number of calliope installations expanding the geographic region for purchasing calliope candidate wells from third parties  joint ventures with larger companies  and drilling wells into low pressure gas reservoirs for the purpose of using calliope to recover stranded natural gas reserves 
purchasing calliope candidate wells the company has calliope operations in oklahoma  texas and louisiana  and considers texas and louisiana to be very fertile areas for calliope 
accordingly  the company opened a houston office to focus exclusively on purchasing wells for calliope and on calliope joint ventures 
during most of  higher natural gas prices made it increasingly difficult for the company to purchase wells for its calliope system 
in addition  higher gas prices provided the incentive for other companies to perform high risk procedures parting shots in an attempt to revive wells prior to abandoning or selling the wells 
these parting shots often result in severe reservoir damage that renders wells unsuitable for calliope 
accordingly  viable calliope candidate wells available to be purchased by the company were very restricted 
joint ventures with third parties in an effort to increase the number of calliope installations  the company has been discussing joint ventures with larger companies 
presentations have been made to a select group of companies  including majors and large independents 
all of the companies have expressed an interest in calliope 
two joint venture agreements were completed during  and joint venture discussions are in progress with a number of companies  including evaluation of candidate wells 
calliope drilling project the company believes that there is a huge amount of gas stranded in abandoned and low pressure reservoirs that  depending on natural gas prices  can be economically recovered using calliope 
it believes drilling new wells for calliope into such reservoirs will provide a repeatable opportunity to lease large areas for systematic re development 
in addition  new wells allow optimum casing and tubular sizes to be installed which will substantially improve reserves and production compared to installing calliope on existing wells where undersized tubulars often restrict calliope s optimum performance 
current low natural gas prices may delay such drilling projects until prices recover 
for example  the company entered into a joint venture to purchase an  foot well located in east texas 
the previous operator drilled the well and encountered low reservoir pressure 
after unsuccessful attempts to make the well produce  the operator sold the well to the company joint venture for salvage value 
calliope was installed and immediately made the well a highly commercial producer 
the well provided a successful test of the calliope drilling concept and demonstrated that calliope will successfully solve liquid loading problems that are difficult to address with other liquid lift technologies 
reserves 
refer to item  properties  significant properties  estimated proved oil and gas reserves and future net revenues  for information regarding oil and gas reserves 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and 
table of contents on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable and that actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the company believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties  the accounting for oil and natural gas reserves  and the estimate of its asset retirement obligations 
derivatives 
the company has elected not to designate its commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  such contracts are recorded at fair value on its balance sheet and changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as they occur 
oil and gas properties 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for costs related to its oil and natural gas properties 
capitalized costs included in the full cost pool are depleted on an aggregate basis using the units of production method 
depreciation  depletion and amortization is a significant component of oil and natural gas properties 
a change in proved reserves without a corresponding change in capitalized costs will cause the depletion rate to increase or decrease 
both the volume of proved reserves and any estimated future expenditures used for the depletion calculation are based on estimates such as those described under oil and gas reserves below 
the capitalized costs in the full cost pool are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
if such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling  the company will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings  unless the company considered price increases subsequent to the balance sheet date which may reduce or eliminate a write down 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower depreciation and depletion in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
periodically market conditions can result in a significant increase in the differential between the nymex price for natural gas and the regional price index that is utilized to value the company s reserves 
changes in oil and natural gas prices have historically had the most significant impact on the company s ceiling test 
in general  the ceiling is lower when prices are lower 
even though oil and natural gas prices can be highly volatile over weeks and even days  the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the test period be used and held constant 
the resulting valuation is a snapshot as of that day and  thus  is generally not indicative of a true fair value that would be placed on the company s reserves by the company or by an independent third party 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on the company s assessment of future prices or costs  but rather are based on prices and costs in effect as of the end the test period 
oil and gas reserves 
the determination of depreciation and depletion expense as well as ceiling test write downs related to the recorded value of the company s oil and natural gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their values  including many factors beyond the company s control 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and the corresponding lifting costs associated with the recovery of these reserves 
the company s reserves  and reserve values  are concentrated in properties significant properties 
some of the significant properties are individual wells and others are multi well 
table of contents properties 
at october   the significant properties represent of the company s total properties but a disproportionate of the discounted value at of the company s reserves 
individual wells on which the company s patented calliope liquid lift system is installed comprise of the significant properties and represent of the discounted reserve value of such properties 
reserves added in comprise of the significant properties and represent of the discounted value of such properties 
estimates of reserve quantities and values for certain significant properties must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties becomes available 
such properties include wells with limited production histories and properties with proved undeveloped or proved non producing reserves 
in addition  the company s patented calliope liquid lift system is generally installed on mature wells 
as such  they contain older down hole equipment that is more subject to failure than new equipment 
the failure of such equipment  particularly casing  can result in complete loss of a well 
historically  performance of the company s wells has not caused significant revisions in its proved reserves 
price changes will affect the economic lives of oil and gas properties and  therefore  price changes may cause reserve revisions 
price changes have resulted in estimated reserve revisions in fiscal year compared with fiscal year end  natural gas prices have decreased and oil prices have decreased 
these price decreases resulted in a reduction in estimated proved reserves 
one measure of the life of the company s proved reserves can be calculated by dividing proved reserves at fiscal year end by production for fiscal year this measure yields an average reserve life of years 
since this measure is an average  by definition  some of the company s properties will have a life shorter than the average and some will have a life longer than the average 
the expected economic lives of the company s properties may vary widely depending on  among other things  the size and quality  natural gas and oil prices  possible curtailments in consumption by purchasers  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
as a result  the company s actual future net cash flows from proved reserves could be materially different from its estimates 
asset retirement obligations 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that the company estimate the future cost of asset retirement obligations  discount that cost to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in its consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including future abandonment costs  inflation  useful life  and cost of capital 
the nature of these estimates requires the company to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations 
revisions to the estimates may be required based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash outlays 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis
