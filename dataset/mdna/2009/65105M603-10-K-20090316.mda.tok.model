item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market considerations 
we have limited liquidity 
we are party to agreements that require cash payments at periodic intervals  including during the next twelve months 
failure to make such required payments have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently party to non fnma fhlmc recourse financing agreements that require us to make cash payments at periodic intervals 
during the period from march  through december   we are required to make principal payments under these financing agreements of approximately million 
events could occur or circumstances could arise  which we may not be able to foresee  that may cause us to be unable to make these cash payments when they become due 
failure to make the payments required under our financing documents would give the lenders the right to require us to repay all amounts owed to them under the applicable financing immediately 
if the lender exercises this right  we likely would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such amounts  which would cause a rapid deterioration in our financial condition and could necessitate a filing for protection under the united states bankruptcy code 
in addition  we are currently party to a construction loan that also requires us to provide cash to the borrower periodically 
during the period from march  through december   we currently expect to be required to fund approximately million of this loan  outside of our cbos  although the timing and amount of any funding is subject to change 
under certain circumstances  if another lender in the syndicate defaults on its funding obligation under the loan  we are required to fund a portion of the defaulting lender s commitment but in no event are we required to fund more than our aggregate funding commitment under the loan agreement 
recently  one lender under the syndicate did default on its funding obligation  which resulted in our having to fund a greater amount than we expected 
additional defaults by lenders in the future would accelerate the amount of cash that we would be required to loan to the borrower  which would negatively impact our liquidity and could result in the failure of the construction project  which would greatly devalue the collateral available to us to reduce our losses 
moreover  we estimate the timing and amount of future funding requirements under the loan based upon estimates provided to us by the borrower  which are subject to change 
if the borrower requests more funds or requires funding earlier than previously estimated  these changes could negatively impact our ability to satisfy our other near term cash requirements 

table of contents the use of cbo financings with coverage tests may have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows 
we have retained  and may in the future retain  subordinate classes of bonds issued by certain of our subsidiaries in our cbo financings 
each of our cbo financings contains tests that measure the amount of over collateralization and excess interest in the transaction 
failure to satisfy these tests would result in principal and or interest cash flow that would otherwise be distributed to more junior classes of securities including those held by newcastle to be redirected to pay down the most senior class of securities outstanding until the tests are satisfied 
as a result  failure to satisfy the coverage tests could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows by temporarily or permanently directing funds that would otherwise come to us to holders of the senior classes of bonds 
in addition  the redirected funds would be used to pay down financing which currently bears an attractive rate  thereby reducing our future earnings from the affected cbo 
as of march   three of our cbos  portfolios vii  viii and ix  were not in compliance with their applicable over collateralization tests and  consequently  we were not receiving cash flows from these cbos currently other than management fees 
based upon our current calculations  two of our cbos  portfolios vii and viii  will not be in compliance with their applicable over collateralization tests as of their next measurement date in march  and we expect these portfolios to remain out of compliance for the foreseeable future 
moreover  given current market conditions  it is possible that all of our cbos could be out of compliance with their over collateralization tests as of one or more measurement dates within the next twelve months 
our ability to rebalance will depend upon the availability of suitable securities  market prices  whether the reinvestment period of the applicable cbo has ended  and other factors that are beyond our control  such rebalancing efforts may be extremely difficult given current market conditions and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our rebalancing efforts 
if the liabilities of our cbos are downgraded by moody s to certain predetermined levels  our discretion to rebalance the applicable cbo portfolios may be negatively impacted 
moreover  if we bring these coverage tests into compliance  we cannot assure you that they will not fall out of compliance in the future or that we will be able to correct any noncompliance 
for more information regarding noncompliance with the terms of certain of our cbo financings in the near future  please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and debt obligations 
in addition  our cbos may also contain specific over collateralization tests that  if failed  can result in the occurrence of an event of default or our being removed as collateral manager of the cbo 
failure of the over collateralization tests can also cause a phantom income issue if cash that constitutes income is diverted to pay down debt instead of distributed to us 
we may experience an event of default or the removal of us as collateral manager under one or more of our cbos  which would negatively affect us in a number of ways 
the documentation governing our cbos specify certain events of default  which  if they occur  would negatively affect us 
events of default include  among other things  failure to pay interest on senior classes of securities within the cbo  breaches of covenants  representations or warranties  bankruptcy  and failure to satisfy specific over collateralization tests 
if an event of default occurs under any of our cbos  it would negatively affect our cash flows  business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we can be removed as manager of a cbo if certain events occur  including the failure to satisfy specific over collateralization tests  failure to satisfy certain key man requirements or an event of default occurring for the failure to pay interest on the related senior classes of securities of the cbo 
if we are removed as collateral manager  we would no longer receive management fees from and no longer be able to manage the assets of the applicable cbo  which would negatively affect our cash flows  business  results of operations and financial condition 
our investments have previously been and in the future may be subject to significant impairment charges  which adversely affect our results of operations 
we are required to periodically evaluate our investments for impairment indicators 
the value of an investment is impaired when our analysis indicates that  with respect to a loan  it is probable that we will not be able to collect the full amount we intended to collect from the loan or  with respect to a security  it is probable that the value of security is other than temporarily impaired 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on a variety of factors depending upon the nature of the investment and the manner in which the income related to such investment calculated for purposes of our financial statements 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we are required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the investment  which could adversely affect our results of operations and funds from operations in the applicable period and thereby adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 

table of contents as has been widely publicized  the recent and ongoing credit and liquidity crisis has resulted in a number of financial institutions recording an unprecedented amount of impairment charges  and we have also been affected by these conditions 
the liquidity crisis has reduced the market trading activity for many real estate securities  resulting in less liquid markets for those securities 
these lower valuations have affected us by  among other things  decreasing our net book value and contributing to our decision to record impairment charges during of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  in accordance with current accounting rules  we recorded an impairment charge of billion through our statement of operations on our securities and loans 
for more information regarding this impairment and the events that lead to its being recorded  please refer to part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market considerations 
the lenders under our repurchase agreements may elect not to extend financing to us  which could quickly and seriously impair our liquidity 
we have historically financed a meaningful portion of our investments not held in cbos with repurchase agreements  which are short term financing arrangements 
under the terms of these agreements  and we may enter into additional repurchase agreements in the future  we sell a security to a counterparty for a specified price and concurrently agree to repurchase the same security from our counterparty at a later date for a higher specified price 
during the term of the repurchase agreement generally days the counterparty makes funds available to us and holds the security as collateral 
our counterparties can also require us to post additional margin as collateral at any time during the term of the agreement 
when the term of a repurchase agreement ends  we are required to repurchase the security for the specified repurchase price  with the difference between the sale and repurchase prices serving as the equivalent of paying interest to the counterparty in return for extending financing to us 
if we want to continue to finance the security with a repurchase agreement  we ask the counterparty to extend or roll the repurchase agreement for another term 
our counterparties are not required to roll our repurchase agreements upon the expiration of the stated terms  which subjects us to a number of risks 
as we have experienced recently and may experience in the future  counterparties electing to roll our repurchase agreements may charge higher spread and impose more onerous terms upon us  including the requirement that we post additional margin as collateral 
more significantly  if a repurchase agreement counterparty elects not to extend our financing  we would be required to pay the counterparty the full repurchase price on the maturity date and find an alternate source of financing 
alternate sources of financing may be more expensive  contain more onerous terms or simply may not be available 
if we were unable to pay the repurchase price for any security financed with a repurchase agreement  the counterparty has the right to sell the underlying security being held as collateral and require us to compensate them for any shortfall between the value of our obligation to the counterparty and the amount for which the collateral was sold which may be sold at a significantly discounted price 
as of march   we had million in repurchase agreement obligations relating to fnma fhlmc securities 
moreover  all of our fnma fhlmc securities are financed under a repurchase agreement with one counterparty 
if this counterparty elected not to roll this repurchase agreement  it is likely that we would not be able to find a replacement counterparty in a timely manner 
if one or more of our repurchase agreement counterparties elected not to roll our existing repurchase agreements  such nonrenewal could increase our cost of financing  significantly reduce our liquidity and force us to sell assets at a loss  each of which would cause a rapid deterioration in our financial condition and possibly necessitate a filing for protection under the united states bankruptcy code 
our determination of how much leverage to apply to our investments may adversely affect our return on our investments and may reduce cash available for distribution 
we leverage our portfolio through borrowings  generally through the use of credit facilities  warehouse facilities  repurchase agreements  mortgage loans on real estate  securitizations  including the issuance of cbos  private or public offerings of debt by subsidiaries  loans to entities in which we hold  directly or indirectly  interests in pools of properties or loans  and other borrowings 
our investment policies do not limit the amount of leverage we may incur with respect to any specific asset or pool of assets  subject to an overall limit on our use of leverage to as defined in our governing documents of the value of our assets on an aggregate basis 
as a result of the ongoing global credit and liquidity crisis  the return we are able to earn on our investments and cash available for distribution to our stockholders has been significantly reduced due to changes in market conditions causing the cost of our financing to increase relative to the income that can be derived from our assets 
although we seek to match fund our investments to limit refinance risk and lock in net spreads  we do not currently match fund our investments not held in our cbos  which increases the risks related to refinancing these investments 
a key to our investment strategy is to finance our investments using match funded financing structures  which match assets and liabilities with respect to maturities and interest rates 
this strategy limits our refinance risk  including the risk of being able to refinance an investment on favorable terms or at all 
we generally use match funded financing structures  such as cbos  to finance our investments in real estate securities and loans 
however  our manager may elect for us to bear a level of refinancing risk on a short term or longer term basis  such as is the case with investments financed with repurchase agreements  when  based on its analysis  our manager determines that bearing such risk is 
table of contents deemed advisable or unavoidable this is generally the case with respect to the residential mortgage loans and fnma fhlmc in which we invest 
in addition  we may be unable  as a result of conditions in the credit markets  to match fund investments 
for example  non recourse term financing not subject to margin requirements has generally not been available or economical for the past year  and may not be available for an indeterminate period of time  which impairs our ability to match fund our investments 
the decision not  or the inability  to match fund certain investments exposes us to additional refinancing risks that may not apply to our other investments 
furthermore  we anticipate that  in most cases  for any period during which our floating rate assets are not match funded with respect to maturity  the income from such assets may respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings 
because of this dynamic  interest income from such investments may rise more slowly than the related interest expense  with a consequent decrease in our net income 
interest rate fluctuations resulting in our interest expense exceeding interest income would result in operating losses for us from these investments 
accordingly  if we do not or are unable to match fund our investments with respect to maturities and interest rates  we will be exposed to the risk that we may not be able to finance or refinance our investments on economically favorable terms or may have to liquidate assets at a loss 
we may not be able to finance our investments on a long term basis on attractive terms  including by means of securitization  which may require us to seek more costly financing for our investments or to liquidate assets 
when we acquire securities and loans that we finance on a short term basis with a view to securitization or other long term financing  we bear the risk of being unable to securitize the assets or otherwise finance them on a long term basis at attractive prices or in a timely matter  or at all 
if it is not possible or economical for us to securitize or otherwise finance such assets on a long term basis  we may be unable to pay down our short term credit facilities  or be required to liquidate the assets at a loss in order to do so 
for example  as a result of the continued deterioration in the credit markets beginning in  financing investments with securitizations or other long term non recourse financing not subject to margin requirements has not been available or economical for the past year  and we do not expect it to be possible or economical for the foreseeable future 
these conditions make it highly likely that we will have to use less efficient forms of financing for any new investments  which will likely require a larger portion of our cash flows to be put toward making the initial investment and thereby reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders and funds available for operations and investments  and which will also likely require us to assume higher levels of risk when financing our investments 
the loans we invest in  and the loans underlying the securities and total rate of return swaps we invest in  are subject to delinquency  foreclosure and loss  which could result in losses to us 
commercial mortgage loans are secured by multifamily or commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure  and risks of loss 
the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower 
if the net operating income of the property is reduced  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
net operating income of an income producing property can be affected by  among other things tenant mix  success of tenant businesses  property management decisions  property location and condition  competition from comparable types of properties  changes in laws that increase operating expense or limit rents that may be charged  any need to address environmental contamination at the property  the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property  changes in national  regional or local economic conditions and or specific industry segments  declines in regional or local real estate values  declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates  increases in interest rates  changes in the availability of credit on favorable terms  real estate tax rates and other operating expenses  changes in governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  including environmental legislation  acts of god  terrorism  social unrest and civil disturbances 
residential mortgage loans  manufactured housing loans and subprime mortgage loans are secured by single family residential property and are also subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure  and risks of loss 
the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by a residential property is dependent upon the income or assets of the borrower 
a number of factors may impair borrowers abilities to repay their loans  including  among other things  changes in the borrower s employment status  changes in national  regional or local economic conditions  changes in interest rates or the availability of credit on favorable terms  changes in regional or local real estate values  changes in regional or local rental rates and changes in real estate taxes 
in the event of any default under a loan held directly by us  we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest of the loan  which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations 
foreclosure of a loan  particularly a commercial loan  can be an expensive and lengthy process  which would negatively affect our anticipated return on the foreclosed loan 
mortgage and asset backed securities are bonds or notes backed by loans and or other financial assets and include commercial mortgage back securities cmbs  fnma fhlmc securities  and real estate related asset backed securities abs 
the ability of a borrower to repay these loans or other financial assets is dependent upon the income or assets of these borrowers 
if a borrower has insufficient income or assets to repay these loans  it will default on its 
table of contents loan 
while we intend to focus on real estate related asset backed securities  there can be no assurance that we will not invest in other types of asset backed securities 
our investments in mortgage and asset backed securities will be adversely affected by defaults under the loans underlying such securities 
to the extent losses are realized on the loans underlying the securities in which we invest  the company may not recover the amount invested in  or  in extreme cases  any of our investment in  such securities 
we have recently experienced increased default rates on our commercial and residential mortgage loans 
for more information  see item  business our investment strategy 
we face a heightened risk of delinquency and loss from our investment in subprime mortgage loans 
we face a heightened risk of delinquency and loss from our investment in subprime mortgage loans 
subprime mortgage loans are generally loans to credit impaired borrowers and borrowers that are ineligible to qualify for loans from conventional mortgage sources due to loan size  lower credit characteristics or documentation standards 
as of december   our subprime mortgage holdings totaled million  or of our assets 
loans to lower credit grade borrowers generally experience higher than average default and loss rates than do loans to borrowers with better credit characteristics 
material differences in the defaults  loss severities and or prepayments on the subprime mortgage loans we acquire or on the manufactured housing loans we acquire from what we estimate in connection with our underwriting of the acquisition of such loans would cause reductions in our income and adversely affect our operating results  both with respect to unsecuritized loans and loans that we have securitized or otherwise financed on a long term match funded basis 
we cannot assure you that our underwriting criteria will afford adequate protection against the higher risks associated with loans made to lower credit grade borrowers 
if we underestimate the extent of losses that our loans will incur  then our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations will be adversely impacted 
we have recently experienced increased default rates on our subprime mortgage loans 
for more information  see item  business our investment strategy subprime securities and subprime retained securities and residual interests 
our investments in debt securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities and to the general risks of investing in subordinated real estate securities 
our investments in debt securities involve special risks 
reits generally are required to invest substantially in real estate or real estate related assets and are subject to the inherent risks associated with real estate related investments discussed in this report 
our investments in debt are subject to the risks described above with respect to mortgage loans and mbs and similar risks  including risks of delinquency and foreclosure  and risks of loss in the event thereof  the dependence upon the successful operation of and net income from real property  risks generally incident to interests in real property  and risks that may be presented by the type and use of a particular property 
debt securities may be unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer 
we may also invest in debt securities that are rated below investment grade 
as a result  investments in debt securities are also subject to risks of limited liquidity in the secondary trading market  substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates or credit spreads  subordination to the prior claims of senior lenders to the issuer  the possibility that earnings of the debt security issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service  and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer of such debt securities during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn 
these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding debt securities and the ability of the issuers thereof to repay principal and interest 
we may be required to post significant amounts of cash collateral at any time to satisfy our margin requirements under some of our financing arrangements  which could adversely affect our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
we finance certain of our investments with debt  such as repurchase agreements and derivatives  that is subject to margin calls 
under the terms of these agreements  the value of assets underlying the debt is marked to market by the lender at the lender s discretion  including on a daily basis 
if the value of the underlying asset declines  the lender has the ability to require us to post additional margin cash or other liquid collateral to compensate for the decline in value of the asset 
conversely  if the value of the underlying asset increases  a portion of the margin we previously posted may be returned to us 
we are typically required to post additional margin in response to any margin call within hours in order to avoid defaulting under the terms of the financing arrangement 

table of contents we are subject to margin calls at any time  and being forced to post additional margin could adversely affect our business in a number of ways 
posting additional margin would decrease our cash available to make other  higher yielding investments thereby decreasing our return on equity or to satisfy other obligations  including future margin calls 
for example  during and  we were required to post approximately million and million  respectively  of additional margin  in large part as a result of the credit and liquidity crisis and resulting market disruption 
while we significantly reduced the amount of debt subject to margin calls as of the date of this report  and are currently contractually restricted from entering into new debt financings subject to margin calls other than to finance fnma fhlmc securities  we may enter into new debt subject to margin calls in the future 
if we do not have the funds available  or otherwise elect not  to satisfy any future margin calls  we could be forced to sell one or more investments at a loss 
moreover  we may be unable  in light of market conditions or other factors  to sell sufficient assets to satisfy the margin requirements within the timeframe required by lenders  which would entitle them to seize the underlying asset and seek payment from us for any shortfall between the value of our obligation to the lender and the value of the asset surrendered 
such a situation would likely result in a rapid deterioration of our financial condition and possibly necessitate a filing for protection under the united states bankruptcy code 
we are subject to significant competition and we may not compete successfully 
we are subject to significant competition in seeking investments 
we compete with other companies  including other reits  insurance companies and other investors  including funds and companies affiliated with our manager 
some of our competitors have greater resources than we possess or have greater access to capital or various types of financing structures than are available to us  and we may not be able to compete successfully for investments or provide attractive investment returns relative to our competitors 
furthermore  competition for investments of the type to be made by us may lead to the returns available from such investments decreasing  which may further limit our ability to generate our desired returns 
we cannot assure you that other companies will not be formed that compete with us for investments or otherwise pursue investment strategies similar to ours or that we will be able to complete successfully against any such companies 
both during the ramp up phase of a potential cbo financing and following the closing of a cbo financing when we have locked in the liability costs for a cbo during the reinvestment period  the rate at which we are able to acquire eligible investments and changes in market conditions may adversely affect our anticipated returns 
we seek to acquire real estate securities and loans and finance them on a long term basis  typically through the issuance of collateralized bond obligations 
we use short term warehouse lines of credit or other arrangements to finance the acquisition of real estate securities and loans until a sufficient quantity of assets are accumulated  at which time we may refinance these lines through a securitization  such as a cbo financing  or other long term financing 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that we will not be able to acquire  during the period that any warehouse facility or short term financing is available  a sufficient amount of eligible assets to maximize the efficiency of a collateralized bond obligation financing 
in addition  conditions in the capital markets may make the issuance of a collateralized bond obligation impossible or economically unattractive to us when we do have a sufficient pool of collateral 
if we are unable to issue a collateralized bond obligation to finance these assets  we may be required to seek other forms of less attractive financing or otherwise to liquidate the assets 
in addition  following each cbo financing we must invest both the net cash raised in the financing as well as cash proceeds of any prepayment or assets which we determine to sell 
until we are able to acquire sufficient assets  our returns will reflect income earned on uninvested cash and  having locked in the cost of liabilities for the particular cbo  the particular cbo s returns will be at risk of declining to the extent that yields on the assets to be acquired decline 
in general  our ability to acquire appropriate investments depends upon the supply in the market of investments we deem suitable  and changes in various economic factors may affect our determination of what constitutes a suitable investment 
our returns will be adversely affected when investments held in cbos are prepaid or sold subsequent to the reinvestment period 
real estate securities and loans are subject to prepayment risk 
in addition  we may sell  and realize gains or losses on  investments 
to the extent such assets were held in cbos subsequent to the end of the reinvestment period  the proceeds are fully utilized to pay down the related cbos debt 
this causes the leverage on the cbo to decrease  thereby lowering our returns on equity 
our investments in senior unsecured reit securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular reit issuer and to the general risks of investing in subordinated real estate securities  which may result in losses to us 
our investments in reit securities involve special risks relating to the particular reit issuer of the securities  including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer 
reits generally are required to substantially invest in operating real estate or real estate related assets and are subject to the inherent risks associated with real estate related investments discussed in this report 

table of contents our investments in reit securities are also subject to the risks described above with respect to mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities and similar risks  including i risks of delinquency and foreclosure  and risks of loss in the event thereof  ii the dependence upon the successful operation of and net income from real property  iii risks generally incident to interests in real property  and iv risks that may be presented by the type and use of a particular commercial property 
reit securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer 
we may also invest in reit securities that are rated below investment grade 
as a result  investments in reit securities are also subject to risks of i limited liquidity in the secondary trading market  ii substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates  iii subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer  iv the operation of mandatory sinking fund or call redemption provisions during periods of declining interest rates that could cause the issuer to reinvest premature redemption proceeds in lower yielding assets  v the possibility that earnings of the reit issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and dividend obligations and vi the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer of such reit securities during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn 
these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding reit securities and the ability of the issuers thereof to repay principal and interest or make dividend payments 
the real estate related loans and other direct and indirect interests in pools of real estate properties or other loans that we invest in may be subject to additional risks relating to the structure and terms of these transactions  which may result in losses to us 
we invest in real estate related loans and other direct and indirect interests in pools of real estate properties or loans such as mezzanine loans and b note mortgage loans 
we invest in mezzanine loans that take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying real property or other business assets or revenue streams or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity owning real property or other business assets or revenue streams or the ownership interest of the parent of such entity 
these types of investments involve a higher degree of risk than long term senior lending secured by business assets or income producing real property because the investment may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by a senior lender 
in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security  we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity  or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to repay our mezzanine loan 
if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan  or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy  our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt is repaid in full 
as a result  we may not recover some or all of our investment 
in addition  mezzanine loans may have higher loan to value ratios than conventional mortgage loans  resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 
we also invest in mortgage loans b notes that while secured by a first mortgage on a single large commercial property or group of related properties are subordinated to an a note secured by the same first mortgage on the same collateral 
as a result  if an issuer defaults  there may not be sufficient funds remaining for b note holders 
b notes reflect similar credit risks to comparably rated commercial mortgage backed securities 
in addition  we invest  directly or indirectly  in pools of real estate properties or loans 
however  since each transaction is privately negotiated  these investments can vary in their structural characteristics and risks 
for example  the rights of holders of b notes to control the process following a borrower default may vary from transaction to transaction  while investments in pools of real estate properties or loans may be subject to varying contractual arrangements with third party co investors in such pools 
further  b notes typically are secured by a single property  and so reflect the risks associated with significant concentration 
these investments also are less liquid than commercial mortgage backed securities 
we may not be able to extend any total return swaps that we enter into in the event that the maturity of the underlying asset is extended  which could adversely impact our leveraging strategy 
subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit  from time to time we leverage certain of our investments through the use of total return swaps 
while we are not currently party to any total return swaps  we may enter into one or more total return swaps in the future 
we may wish to renew many of such swaps  which are for specified terms  as they mature  particularly in the event that the maturity of the underlying asset is extended 
however  there is a limited number of providers of such swaps  and there is no assurance the initial swap providers will choose to renew the swaps  and if they do not renew that we would be able to obtain suitable replacement providers 
providers may choose not to renew our total return swaps for a number of reasons  including increases in the provider s cost of funding  insufficient volume of business with a particular provider  a desire by our company to invest in a type of swap that the provider does not view as economically attractive due to changes in interest rates or other market factors  or the inability of our company and a provider to agree on terms 
furthermore  our ability to invest in total return swaps  other than through a taxable reit subsidiary  or trs  may be severely limited by the reit qualification requirements because total return swaps are not qualifying assets and do not produce qualifying income for purposes of the reit asset and income tests 

table of contents investment in non investment grade loans may involve increased risk of loss 
we acquire and may continue to acquire in the future certain loans that do not conform to conventional loan criteria applied by traditional lenders and are not rated or are rated as non investment grade for example  for investments rated by moody s investors service  ratings lower than baa  and for standard poor s  bbb or below 
the non investment grade ratings for these loans typically result from the overall leverage of the loans  the lack of a strong operating history for the properties underlying the loans  the borrowers credit history  the properties underlying cash flow or other factors 
as a result  these loans have a higher risk of default and loss than conventional loans 
any loss we incur may reduce distributions to our stockholders 
there are no limits on the percentage of unrated or non investment grade assets we may hold in our portfolio 
insurance on real estate in which we have interests including the real estate serving as collateral for our real estate securities and loans may not cover all losses 
there are certain types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as earthquakes  floods  hurricanes  terrorism or acts of war  that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations  and other factors  including terrorism or acts of war  also might make the insurance proceeds insufficient to repair or replace a property if it is damaged or destroyed 
under such circumstances  the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the affected real property 
as a result of the events of september   insurance companies are limiting and or excluding coverage for acts of terrorism in insurance policies 
as a result  we may suffer losses from acts of terrorism that are not covered by insurance 
in addition  the mortgage loans that are secured by certain of the properties in which we have interests contain customary covenants  including covenants that require property insurance to be maintained in an amount equal to the replacement cost of the properties 
there can be no assurance that the lenders under these mortgage loans will not take the position that exclusions from coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of a covenant which  if uncured  could allow the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of the mortgage loans 
many of our investments are illiquid  and this lack of liquidity could significantly impede our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions or to realize the value at which such investments are carried if we are required to dispose of them 
the real estate properties that we own and operate and our other direct and indirect investments in real estate and real estate related assets are generally illiquid 
our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries are also illiquid 
in addition  the real estate securities that we purchase in connection with privately negotiated transactions are not registered under the relevant securities laws  resulting in a prohibition against their transfer  sale  pledge or other disposition except in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of  or is otherwise in accordance with  those laws 
in addition  there are no established trading markets for a majority of our investments 
as a result  our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited 
our securities have historically been valued based primarily on third party quotations  which are subject to significant variability based on the liquidity and price transparency created by market trading activity 
the ongoing dislocation in the trading markets has continued to reduce the trading for many real estate securities  resulting in less transparent prices for those securities 
consequently  it is currently more difficult for us to sell many of our assets now that it has been historically because  if we were to sell such assets  we will likely not have access to readily ascertainable market prices when establishing valuations of them 
moreover  currently there is a relatively low market demand for the vast majority of the types of assets that we hold  which may make it extremely difficult to sell assets 
if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our illiquid investments quickly  we may realize significantly less than the amount at which we have previously valued these investments 
interest rate fluctuations and shifts in the yield curve may cause losses 
our primary interest rate exposures relate to our real estate securities  loans  floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
changes in interest rates  including changes in expected interest rates or yield curves  affect our business in a number of ways 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities and hedges 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect  among other things  our ability to acquire real estate securities and loans at attractive prices  the value of our real estate securities  loans and derivatives and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  loan and collateral defaults may increase and result in credit losses that would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond our control 
our ability to execute our business strategy  particularly the growth of our investment portfolio  depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional capital 
our financing strategy is dependent on our ability to place 
table of contents the match funded debt we use to finance our investments at rates that provide a positive net spread 
if spreads for such liabilities widen or if demand for such liabilities ceases to exist  then our ability to execute future financings will be severely restricted 
interest rate changes may also impact our net book value as our real estate securities  real estate related loans and hedge derivatives are marked to market each quarter 
debt obligations are not marked to market 
generally  as interest rates increase  the value of our fixed rate securities decreases  which will decrease the book value of our equity 
furthermore  shifts in the us treasury yield curve reflecting an increase in interest rates would also affect the yield required on our real estate securities and therefore their value 
for example  increasing interest rates would reduce the value of the fixed rate assets we hold at the time because the higher yields required by increased interest rates result in lower market prices on existing fixed rate assets in order to adjust the yield upward to meet the market  and vice versa 
this would have similar effects on our real estate securities portfolio and our financial position and operations to a change in interest rates generally 
our investments in real estate securities and loans are subject to changes in credit spreads  which could adversely affect our ability to realize gains on the sale of such investments 
real estate securities and loans are subject to changes in credit spreads 
credit spreads measure the yield demanded on securities and loans by the market based on their credit relative to a specific benchmark 
fixed rate securities and loans are valued based on a market credit spread over the rate payable on fixed rate us treasuries of like maturity 
floating rate securities and loans are valued based on a market credit spread over libor and are affected similarly by changes in libor spreads 
excessive supply of these securities combined with reduced demand will generally cause the market to require a higher yield on these securities and loans  resulting in the use of a higher  or wider  spread over the benchmark rate to value such securities 
under such conditions  the value of our real estate securities and loan portfolios would tend to decline 
conversely  if the spread used to value such securities were to decrease  or tighten  the value of our real estate securities portfolio would tend to increase 
such changes in the market value of our real estate securities and loan portfolios may affect our net equity  net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  and therefore our ability to realize gains on such securities  or indirectly through their impact on our ability to borrow and access capital 
during and credit spreads widened substantially 
this widening of credit spreads caused the net unrealized gains on our securities  loans and derivatives  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or retained earnings  and therefore our book value per share  to decrease and resulted in net losses 
in addition  if the value of our loans subject to financing agreements were to decline  it could affect our ability to refinance such loans upon the maturity of the related repurchase agreements 
any credit or spread related losses incurred with respect to our loans would affect us in the same way as similar losses on our real estate securities portfolio as described above 
in addition  widening credit spreads will generally result in a decrease in the mark to market value of certain investments which are treated as derivatives on our balance sheet  such as total rate of return swaps 
since changes in the value of such assets are reflected in our income statement  this would result in a decrease in our net income 
to the extent that we choose to make investments in real estate related assets by means of entering into total rate of return swaps  our net income will be susceptible to decreases stemming from credit spread changes 
any hedging transactions that we enter into may limit our gains or result in losses 
we use derivatives to hedge a portion of our interest rate exposure  and this approach has certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the cash available for distribution to stockholders and that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
we have adopted a general policy with respect to the use of derivatives  which generally allows us to use derivatives where appropriate  but does not set forth specific policies and procedures or require that we hedge any specific amount of risk 
from time to time  we use derivative instruments  including forwards  futures  swaps and options  in our risk management strategy to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations 
a hedge may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position 
our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of the use of derivatives 
there are limits to the ability of hedging strategy to protect us completely against interest rate risks 
when rates change  we expect the gain or loss on derivatives to be offset by a related but inverse change in the value of the items  generally our liabilities  which we hedge 
we cannot assure you  however  that our use of derivatives will offset the risks related to changes in interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risk of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in losses 
in addition  our hedging strategy may limit our flexibility by causing us to refrain from taking certain actions that would be potentially profitable but would cause adverse consequences under the terms of our hedging arrangements 
in managing our hedge instruments  we consider the effect of the expected hedging income on the reit qualification tests that limit the amount of gross income that a reit may receive from hedging 
the reit provisions of the 
table of contents internal revenue code limit our ability to hedge 
we need to carefully monitor  and may have to limit  our hedging strategy to assure that we do not realize hedging income  or hold hedges having a value  in excess of the amounts which would cause us to fail the reit gross income and asset tests 
accounting for derivatives under gaap is extremely complicated 
any failure by us to account for our derivatives properly in accordance with gaap in our financial statements could adversely affect our earnings 
under certain conditions  increases in prepayment rates can adversely affect yields on certain investments  including our residential mortgage loans 
the value of our assets may be affected by prepayment rates on our residential mortgage loans and other floating rate assets 
prepayment rates are influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of economic  geographic and other factors beyond our control  and consequently  such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty 
in periods of declining mortgage interest rates  prepayments on loans generally increase 
if general interest rates decline as well  the proceeds of such prepayments received during such periods are likely to be reinvested by us in assets yielding less than the yields on the assets that were prepaid 
in addition  the market value of floating rate assets may  because of the risk of prepayment  benefit less than fixed rate assets from declining interest rates 
conversely  in periods of rising interest rates  prepayments on loans generally decrease  in which case we would not have the prepayment proceeds available to invest in assets with higher yields 
under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios we may fail to recoup fully our cost of acquisition of certain investments 
in addition  when market conditions lead us to increase the portion of our cbo investments that are comprised of floating rate securities  the risk of assets inside our cbos prepaying increases 
since our cbo financing costs are locked in  reinvestment of such prepayment proceeds at lower yields than the initial investments  as a result of changes in the interest rate or credit spread environment  will result in a decrease of the return on our equity and therefore our net income 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities with respect to our real estate in which we have interests may adversely affect our results of operations 
our operating costs may be affected by our obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  as well as the cost of complying with future legislation with respect to the assets  or loans secured by assets  with environmental problems that materially impair the value of the assets 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in such property 
such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to remediate properly  may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow by using such real property as collateral 
certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials  including asbestos containing materials  into the environment  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released asbestos containing materials or other hazardous materials 
environmental laws may also impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or transferred or in which businesses it may be operated  and these restrictions may require expenditures 
in connection with the direct or indirect ownership and operation of properties  we may be potentially liable for any such costs 
the cost of defending against claims of liability or remediating contaminated property and the cost of complying with environmental laws could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
risks relating to our reit status and other matters our failure to qualify as a reit would result in higher taxes and reduced cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
we operate in a manner intended to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market values of our assets  some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination  and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals 
our compliance with the reit income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis 
moreover  the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for federal income tax purposes  and the tax treatment of participation interests that we hold in mortgage loans and mezzanine loans  may be uncertain in some circumstances  which could affect the application of the reit qualification requirements 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or other issuers will not cause a violation of the reit requirements 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates  and distributions to stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income 
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders  which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of  and trading prices for  our stock 
unless entitled to relief under certain internal revenue code provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit 

table of contents our failure to qualify as a reit would constitute an event of default under a significant number of our financings and other agreements and would cause our common and preferred stock to be delisted from the nyse 
our failure to qualify as a reit would constitute an event of default under a significant number of our financing and other agreements  which would  in turn  result in either the acceleration of the amounts we owe to the applicable counterparty or otherwise give our counterparty the right to terminate the applicable agreement 
either scenario would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to conduct our business  which would likely  in turn  require the company to restructure or file for protection under the us bankruptcy code 
in addition  the new york stock exchange requires  as a condition to the continued listing of our common and preferred shares  that we maintain our reit status 
consequently  if we fail to maintain our reit status  our common and preferred shares would promptly be delisted from the nyse  which would decrease the trading activity of such shares 
this could make it difficult to sell shares and could cause the market volume of the shares trading to decline 
if newcastle was delisted as a result of losing its reit status and desired to relist its shares on the nyse  the company would have to reapply to the nyse to be listed as a domestic corporation 
as the nyse s listing standards for reits are less onerous than its standards for domestic corporations  it would be more difficult for the company to become a listed company under these heightened standards 
given current conditions  newcastle would not be able to satisfy the nyse s listing standards for a domestic corporation 
as a result  if it were delisted from the nyse  it likely would not be able to relist as a domestic corporation  and thus the company s common and preferred shares could not trade on the nyse 
dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates 
tax law changes in reduced the maximum tax rate for dividends payable to individuals from to through 
dividends payable by reits  however  are generally not eligible for the reduced rates 
although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits  the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals  trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non reit corporations that pay dividends  which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits  including our common stock 
in addition  the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the newly favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends  which could affect the value of our real estate assets negatively 
reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 
we generally must distribute annually at least of our net taxable income  excluding any net capital gain  in order for corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute 
we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code 
however  differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short term or long term basis to meet the distribution requirement of the internal revenue code 
certain of our assets may generate substantial mismatches between taxable income and available cash 
as a result  the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our net taxable income could cause us to i sell assets in adverse market conditions  ii borrow on unfavorable terms or iii distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions  capital expenditures or repayment of debt  in order to comply with reit requirements 
further  amounts distributed will not be available to fund investment activities 
if we fail to obtain debt or equity capital in the future  it could limit our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from operations to pay our operating expenses and to pay distributions to our stockholders 
as a reit  we are generally required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and not including net capital losses each year to our stockholders 
to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to reits  we intend to make distributions to our stockholders in amounts such that we distribute all or substantially all our net taxable income each year  subject to certain adjustments 
however  our ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this annual report on form k  particularly in light of current market conditions 
in the event of a continued downturn in our operating results and financial performance or continued declines in the value of our asset portfolio  we may be unable to declare or pay quarterly distributions or make distributions to our stockholders  and we may elect to comply with our reit distribution requirements by  after completing various procedural steps  distributing  under certain circumstances  up to of the required amount in the form of common shares in lieu of cash 
the timing and amount of distributions are in the sole discretion of our board of directors  which considers  among other factors  our earnings  financial condition  debt service obligations and applicable debt covenants  reit qualification requirements and other tax considerations and capital expenditure requirements as our board may deem relevant from time to time 

table of contents the stock ownership limit imposed by the internal revenue code for reits and our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and restrict our business combination opportunities 
in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code  not more than in value of our outstanding stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities at any time during the last half of each taxable year after our first year 
our charter  with certain exceptions  authorizes our board of directors to take the actions that are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit 
unless exempted by our board of directors  no person may own more than of the aggregate value of our outstanding capital stock  treating classes and series of our stock in the aggregate  or more than of the outstanding shares of our series b preferred stock  series c preferred stock or our series d preferred stock 
our board may grant an exemption in its sole discretion  subject to such conditions  representations and undertakings as it may determine in its sole discretion 
these ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our board has granted limited exemptions to an affiliate of our manager  a third party group of funds managed by cohen steers  and certain affiliates of these entities 
even if we remain qualified as a reit  we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 
even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and assets  including taxes on any undistributed income  tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure  and state or local income  property and transfer taxes  such as mortgage recording taxes 
moreover  if a reit distributes less than of its taxable income to its stockholders during any calendar year including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year  then it is required to pay an excise tax on of any shortfall between the required and the amount that was actually distributed 
any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
in addition  in order to meet the reit qualification requirements  or to avert the imposition of a tax that applies to certain gains derived by a reit from dealer property or inventory  we may hold some of our assets through taxable reit subsidiaries 
such subsidiaries will be subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates 
complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of our income  the nature and diversification of our assets  the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock 
we also may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 
thus  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments 
complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively 
the existing reit provisions of the internal revenue code may substantially limit our ability to hedge our operations because a significant amount of the income from those hedging transactions is likely to be treated as non qualifying income for purposes of both of satisfying reit gross income tests 
in addition  we must limit our aggregate income from non qualified hedging transactions  from our provision of services and from other non qualifying sources  to less than of our annual gross income determined without regard to gross income from qualified hedging transactions 
as a result  we may have to limit our use of certain hedging techniques or implement those hedges through total return swaps 
this could result in greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to incur or could increase the cost of our hedging activities 
if we fail to comply with these limitations  we could lose our reit qualification for us federal income tax purposes  unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  and we meet certain other technical requirements 
even if our failure was due to reasonable cause  we might incur a penalty tax 
the taxable mortgage pool rules may increase the taxes that we or our stockholders may incur  and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations 
certain of our securitizations have resulted in the creation of taxable mortgage pools for federal income tax purposes 
as a reit  so long as we own of the equity interests in a taxable mortgage pool  we would generally not be adversely affected by the characterization of the securitization as a taxable mortgage pool 
certain categories of stockholders  however  such as foreign stockholders eligible for treaty or other benefits  stockholders with net operating losses  and certain tax exempt stockholders that are subject to unrelated business income tax  could be subject to increased taxes on a portion of their dividend income from us that is attributable to the taxable mortgage pool 
in addition  to the extent that our stock is owned by tax exempt disqualified organizations  such as certain government related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business income  we may incur a corporate level tax on a portion of our income from the taxable mortgage pool 
in that case  we may reduce the amount of our distributions to any disqualified organization whose stock ownership gave rise to the tax 
maintenance of our investment company act exemption imposes limits on our operations 
we conduct our operations so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended 
we believe that there are a number of exemptions under the investment company act that may be applicable to us 
the assets that we may acquire  therefore  are limited by the provisions of the investment 
table of contents company act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the investment company act 
in addition  we could  among other things  be required either a to change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company or b to register as an investment company  either of which could adversely affect us and the market price for our stock 
erisa may restrict investments by plans in our common stock 
a plan fiduciary considering an investment in our common stock should consider  among other things  whether such an investment is consistent with the fiduciary obligations under erisa  including whether such investment might constitute or give rise to a prohibited transaction under erisa  the internal revenue code or any substantially similar federal  state or local law and  if so  whether an exemption from such prohibited transaction rules is available 
maryland takeover statutes may prevent a change of our control 
this could depress our stock price 
under maryland law  business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
these business combinations include certain mergers  consolidations  share exchanges  or  in circumstances specified in the statute  an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities or a liquidation or dissolution 
an interested stockholder is defined as any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of the corporation s outstanding shares  or an affiliate or associate of a corporation who  at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation 
a person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he or she otherwise would have become an interested stockholder 
after the five year prohibition  any business combination between the maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation voting together as a single group  and two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder voting together as a single voting group 
the business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer  including potential acquisitions that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our authorized  but unissued common and preferred stock may prevent a change in our control 
our charter authorizes us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock 
in addition  our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences  rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares 
as a result  our board may establish a series of preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our stockholder rights plan could inhibit a change in our control 
we have adopted a stockholder rights agreement 
under the terms of the rights agreement  in general  if a person or group acquires more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  all of our other common stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a discount to such securities fair market value  thus causing substantial dilution to the acquiring person 
the rights agreement may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control not approved by our board of directors and  therefore  could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with such a transaction 
in addition  since our board of directors can prevent the rights agreement from operating  in the event our board approves of an acquiring person  the rights agreement gives our board of directors significant discretion over whether a potential acquirer s efforts to acquire a large interest in us will be successful 
because the rights agreement contains provisions that are designed to assure that the executive officers  our manager and its affiliates will never  alone  be considered a group that is an acquiring person  the rights agreement provides the executive officers  our manager and its affiliates with certain advantages under the rights agreement that are not available to other stockholders 

table of contents our staggered board and other provisions of our charter and bylaws may prevent a change in our control 
our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors 
directors of each class are chosen for three year terms upon the expiration of their current terms  and each year one class of directors is elected by the stockholders 
the staggered terms of our directors may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt at a change in control  even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
in addition  our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
risks related to our common shares we are currently not in compliance with one of the nyse s listing standards  and our shares of common stock and preferred stock may be delisted from the nyse in the near future  which would reduce the trading activity and share price of both our common and preferred shares 
the new york stock exchange nyse requires companies who list their shares on the exchange to comply with the nyse s regulations  a portion of which are referred to as the continued listing standards 
as previously disclosed  on january   newcastle received a notification from the nyse that the company was not in compliance with one of the nyse s continued listing standards  which requires that the average closing price of the company s common shares equal at least per share over a consecutive trading day period 
under nyse rules as recently revised  the company has until november to bring its day average closing common share price above per share in order to avoid the delisting of its common shares 
while the company notified the nyse of its intent to cure this deficiency  the company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to do so 
if the company does not bring the average closing price of its common shares above within the cure period  the nyse will likely delist both the company s common stock as well as its preferred stock 
if this delisting occurs  then shares of the company s common stock and preferred stock will likely trade on a less active trading platform  which would almost certainly decrease the trading activity of the company s common and preferred stock 
this could make it difficult to sell shares and could cause the market volume of the shares trading to decline 
even if the company is able to cure the compliance deficiency described above  the company could fail other tests under the nyse s continued listing standards such as the requirement that the company maintain its status as a reit or that its global market capitalization be not less than million during any consecutive day trading period the nyse and sec have temporarily reduced this requirement to million through june   after which it will return to million unless the nyse and sec extend or otherwise alter the test 
as of march   the company s average market capitalization over the most recent consecutive day trading period was approximately million 
if the company fails either of these tests  the nyse will promptly delist the company s common stock and preferred stock 
moreover  the nyse has the right to delist the company s common stock and preferred stock with little or no notice if the nyse deems it appropriate to do so 
as a result  the company cautions readers that its common stock and or preferred stock could be delisted from the nyse with little advance warning  and such delisting could occur in the near future 
our share price has fluctuated significantly  particularly on a percentage basis  and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them 
the trading price of our common shares has recently been highly volatile  with daily fluctuations commonly ranging between and and at times varying as much as during one day of trading 
moreover  future share price fluctuations could likely be subject to similarly wide price fluctuations in the future in response to various factors  including market conditions in the broader stock market in general  or in the reit or real estate industry in particular  market perception of our current and projected financial condition  potential growth  future earnings and future cash dividends  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results  market perception or media coverage of our manager or its affiliates  actions by rating agencies  short sales of our common stock  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  media coverage of us  other reits or the outlook of the real estate industry  major reductions in trading volumes on the exchanges on which we operate  credit deterioration within our portfolio  
table of contents legislative or regulatory developments  including changes in the status of our regulatory approvals or licenses  and litigation and governmental investigations 
these and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common shares to fluctuate substantially  which may negatively affect the price or liquidity of our common shares 
moreover  the recent market conditions have negatively impacted our share price and may do so in the future 
when the market price of a stock has been volatile or has decreased significantly in the past  holders of that stock have  at times  instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our shareholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending  settling or paying any resulting judgments related to the lawsuit 
such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business and hurt our share price 
we may be unable or elect not to pay dividends on our common or preferred shares in the future  which would negatively impact our business in a number of ways and decrease the price of our common and preferred shares 
we did not pay dividends on our common stock for the fourth fiscal quarter of while we are required to make distributions in order to maintain our reit status as described above under we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from operations to pay our operating expenses and to pay distributions to our stockholders  we may elect not to maintain our reit status  in which case we would no longer be required to make such distributions 
moreover  even if we do elect to maintain our reit status  we may elect to comply with the applicable requirements by  after completing various procedural steps  distributing  under certain circumstances  up to of the required amount in the form of common shares in lieu of cash 
if we elect not to maintain our reit status or to satisfy any required distributions in common shares in lieu of cash  such action could negatively affect our business and financial condition as well as the price of both our common and preferred shares 
no assurance can be given that we will pay any dividends on our common shares in the future 
in addition  in the fourth fiscal quarter of  our board of directors elected not to declare any of the specified dividends on our three series of preferred stock 
until we pay all accrued dividends on our preferred shares  we cannot pay any dividends on our common shares  pay any consideration to repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or redeem any shares of any series of our preferred stock without redeeming all of our outstanding preferred shares in accordance with the governing documentation 
moreover  if we do not pay dividends on any series of preferred stock for six or more periods  then holders of each affected series obtain the right to call a special meeting and elect two members to our board of directors 
consequently  failure to pay dividends on our preferred shares restricts the actions that we may take with respect to our common and preferred shares and could affect the composition of our board and  thus  the management of our business 
no assurance can be given that we will pay any dividends on any series of our preferred shares in the future 
an increase in market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
one of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of our common stock is our distribution rate as a percentage of our share price relative to market interest rates 
if the market price of our common stock is based primarily on the earnings and return that we derive from our investments and income with respect to our investments and our related distributions to stockholders  and not from the market value of the investments themselves  then interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions will likely affect the market price of our common stock 
for instance  if market interest rates rise without an increase in our distribution rate  the market price of our common stock could decrease as potential investors may require a higher distribution yield on our common stock or seek other securities paying higher distributions or interest 
in addition  rising interest rates would result in increased interest expense on our variable rate debt  thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay distributions
