our actual results could differ from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to certain factors  including those discussed in part i  item a and elsewhere in this report 
overview comarco  inc  through its subsidiary comarco wireless technologies  inc collectively  we  comarco  or the company  is a leading designer and manufacturer of standalone mobile power adapters used to power and charge notebook computers  mobile phones  blackberry smartphones  ipods  and many other portable  rechargeable consumer electronic devices 
our operations consist solely of the operations of comarco wireless technologies  inc cwt 
until fiscal  comarco was also a provider of wireless test solutions for the wireless industry  as well as a provider of emergency call boxes and related maintenance services 
we entered fiscal year with an objective to focus on our chargesource business and to maximize the value of our wts and call box businesses 
the assessment of our strategic initiatives with respect to these businesses culminated in the sale of these two businesses during the fiscal year 
industry and company trends and uncertainties designed with the needs of the mobile professional in mind  our chargesource standalone mobile power adapters provide a high level of functionality and compatibility in an industry leading compact design 
our current and planned chargesource product offerings consist of standalone ac dc  ac  and dc power adapters designed for the right mix of power output and functionality for most retail  oem  and enterprise customers 
our chargesource products are programmable  allowing those who use rechargeable electronic devices to carry just one power adapter to support multiple electronic devices 
by simply changing the compact smarttip connected to the end of the output cable  our standalone power adapters are capable of simultaneously charging and powering multiple devices from all major consumer electronics companies  including most notebook computers  mobile phones  blackberry smartphones  ipods  and many other portable  rechargeable consumer electronic devices without requiring a peripheral product or extra cable 
personal computer manufacturers continue to design and manufacture notebook computers with enhanced functionality and features 
these notebook computers generally have greater power requirements 
as power requirements increase  so generally does the size of the oem power adapter sold with each notebook computer 
to address this industry wide trend  we have developed a family of compact high power chargesource standalone power adapters that are compatible with most legacy  current  and planned notebook computers 
these new standalone power adapters are able to deliver up to watts of power in a very small form factor or compact size 
management currently considers the following additional trends  events  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our business on march   we entered into an exclusive retail strategic product development and supply agreement the targus agreement with targus group international  inc  a delaware corporation targus 
we expect to begin shipments to targus under this targus agreement during the second quarter of fiscal the product offerings for targus include the following 
table of contents a programmable ac adapter that connects easily to a standard wall plug and includes a dc cable that supports charging two devices simultaneously 
it will be packaged with up to smarttips 
a programmable ac adapter that includes both input and output cables ac or ac dc and will be packaged with up to smarttips 
in late january  we began volume production of a small form factor watt ac dc standalone power adapter designed to the stringent specifications of lenovo  a leading notebook computer oem 
this innovative product is currently being marketed and sold as an oem branded aftermarket accessory 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a non exclusive distribution arrangement with kensington  thereby terminating our exclusive distribution agreement 
under the exclusive targus agreement  we will no longer be able to sell to kensington upon commencing shipments to targus 
revenue for fiscal increased significantly to million compared to million for fiscal the increase is attributable to the launch of the watt product for lenovo 
the current level of sales is insufficient to fully absorb our operating expenses 
our ability to drive increased sales is dependent upon  among others  the following factors successful development and release for manufacture of certain ac and ac dc standalone power adapter products designed to address the requirements of our retail and oem accessories channels  securing additional oem partners  and market and customer acceptance of our new products expected to be available by the end of the second quarter of our chargesource products are based on proprietary patented construction technology that enables the production of slim and light power sources for many rechargeable mobile devices from standard wall outlets  as well as power outlets in airplanes  cars  and other modes of transportation 
we are currently in negotiations with our third party contract manufacturers in an effort to reduce our unit costs for our products 
reducing our product costs is important to our efforts to improve our margins 
we are focused on preserving our cash balances by monitoring expenses  identifying costs savings  and investing only in those development programs and products that we believe will most likely contribute to our profitability 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to apply accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments 
all of our significant accounting policies are presented in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
of our significant accounting policies  we believe the following are the most significant and involve a higher degree of uncertainty  subjectivity  and judgments 
these policies involve estimates and judgments that are inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and judgments may significantly impact our annual and quarterly operating results 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
generally  our products are shipped fob named point of shipment  whether it is lake forest  our corporate headquarters  or china  the shipping point of our contract manufacturers 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to be measured based on the award s fair value on the date of grant  and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
we currently use either a lattice binomial or the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments 
both the lattice binomial and the black scholes option pricing model are based on a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected forfeiture rates  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the prevailing difference between the two models is the lattice binomial model s ability to enhance the simple assumptions that underlie the black sholes model 
the lattice binomial model allows for assumptions such as risk free rate of interest  volatility and exercise rate to vary over time reflecting a more realistic pattern of economic and behavioral occurrences 
if the assumptions change under either model  stock based compensation may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and related terms based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific customer accounts and establishes reserves for uncollectible receivables based upon specific identification of account balances that have indications of uncertainty of collection 
indications of uncertainty of collections may include the customer s inability to pay  customer dissatisfaction  or other factors 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our losses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of inventory we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory calculated on average costs  which approximates first in  first out basis or market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on excess quantities on hand based upon historical and forecasted component usage 
as demonstrated during prior periods  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results 
income taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense in conjunction with the evaluation and measurement of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary timing differences result in the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on a net basis and included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess on a periodic basis the 
table of contents probability that our net deferred tax assets  if any  will be recovered 
if after evaluating all of the positive and negative evidence  a conclusion is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be recovered  a valuation allowance is provided with a corresponding charge to tax expense to reserve the portion of the deferred tax assets which are estimated to be more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any required valuation allowance 
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on the entire deferred tax asset balance 
this valuation allowance was established based on management s overall assessment of risks and uncertainties related to our future ability to realize  and hence  utilize certain deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating loss carry forwards  temporary differences  and future tax deductions resulting from certain types of stock option exercises 
due to the current and prior years operating losses  the adjusted net deferred tax assets remained fully reserved as of january  valuation of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns that negatively impact our customers or markets  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using a weighted average of the market approach and the discounted expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our cost of capital 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in that event  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets could be required

the product cost increased over the prior year due to a change in the product mix 
in fiscal our largest product shipments were the watt adapters sold to lenovo  which have a very low margin at the product cost level 
offsetting the increase in product costs  the under absorption of fixed supply chain overhead decreased by percent  or million  as a result of increased product sales 
adversely impacting cost of revenue during fiscal were inventory reserve and scrap costs  which increased by million  or percent during the year  compared to fiscal  due to inventory reserves recorded primarily in the fourth quarter that adversely impacted margins 
inventory reserves of million were recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal due to reduced demand for legacy products as well as excess material purchased subsequent to the receipt of a customer purchase order which the customer later canceled in the fourth quarter

business outlook we expect revenues on an overall basis to increase during fiscal as previously discussed  in march we entered into a strategic product development and supply agreement with targus 
we expect to begin volume shipments to targus in the second quarter of fiscal we received our first purchase order from targus under this agreement for expected delivery during the second quarter of fiscal we have not generated a positive gross margin on the sale of our chargesource products during fiscal or our future is highly dependent on our ability to sell our products at a profit and ultimately to return to overall profitability 
to accomplish this  we must increase the sales volumes of our current and newly designed chargesource products to appropriately absorb fixed administrative and contract manufacturing overhead 
further  we must successfully reduce our unit costs with our third party contract manufacturers  for which negotiations are currently in process 
if we are unsuccessful in achieving these objectives  it will have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
we have working capital totaling million at january  further  subsequent to january   we successfully negotiated a million line of credit with silicon valley bank  see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
we believe that our current working capital in combination with our line of credit will provide the necessary resources to effect our business plan in the near future 
as we execute on our current strategy  we may require further debt and or equity capital to fund our working capital needs 
the current us capital markets are illiquid and the availability of funds is sparse 
the inability to access these funds when needed could have a material adverse effect on the our operations and financial condition

in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances  we expect to derive a portion of our liquidity from our cash flows from operations 
as discussed above  certain factors and events could negatively affect our cash flows from operations  including in the event that any of our significant customers are unable to perform due to their inability to take delivery of the ordered products and or pay for such products in a timely manner  we would be required to establish alternative distribution channels 
such significant change would negatively impact our revenue  operating results  and cash flows 
should the contract manufacturer of our chargesource products become unable to manufacture our products at the level currently anticipated  our operating results and cash flows would be negatively impacted 

table of contents we are focused on preserving our cash balances by monitoring expenses  identifying cost savings  and investing only in those development programs and products that we believe will most likely contribute to our profitability 
contractual obligations in the course of our business operations  we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as operating leases and purchase orders 
payments under these contracts are summarized as follows as of january  in thousands payments due by period less than to to year years years more than years total operating lease obligations less sublease income purchase obligations we generally issue purchase orders to our suppliers with delivery dates from four to six weeks from the purchase order date 
in addition  we regularly provide significant suppliers with rolling six month forecasts of material and finished goods requirements for planning and long lead time parts procurement purposes only 
we are committed to accepting delivery of materials pursuant to our purchase orders subject to various contract provisions that allow us to delay receipt of such order or allow us to cancel orders beyond certain agreed lead times 
such cancellations may or may not include cancellation costs payable by us 
in the past  we have been required to take delivery of materials from our suppliers that were in excess of our requirements and we have previously recognized charges and expenses related to such excess material 
if we are unable to adequately manage our suppliers and adjust such commitments for changes in demand  we may incur additional inventory expenses related to excess and obsolete inventory

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency risk we are exposed to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates 
as of january   we had no material accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
our standard terms require customers to pay for our products and services in us dollars 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  we may limit our exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions through forward foreign exchange contracts 
to date  sales denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a significant portion of our cash balances in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents have maturities dates of three months or less and the fair value approximates the carrying value in our consolidated financial statements
