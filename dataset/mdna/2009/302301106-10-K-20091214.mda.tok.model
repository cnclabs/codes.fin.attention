in our pawnshops  we acquire inventory for retail sales through pawn loan forfeitures and  to a lesser extent  through purchases of customers merchandise 
the gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on our assessment of the loan or purchase value at the time the property is either accepted as loan collateral or purchased 
improper value assessment in the lending or purchasing process can result in lower margins or reduced marketability of the merchandise 
one indicator of lower marketability is how long we have held the inventory

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  loan loss allowances  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  observable trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we use this information to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
you should refer to note a of our consolidated financial statements for a more complete review of other accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
pawn loan and sales revenue recognition we record pawn service charges using the interest method for all pawn loans we believe to be collectible 
we base our estimate of collectible loans on several factors  including recent redemption rates  historical trends in redemption rates and the amount of loans due in the following two to three months 
unexpected variations in any of these factors could change our estimate of collectible loans  affecting our earnings and financial condition 
if a pawn loan is not repaid  we value the forfeited collateral inventory at the lower of cost pawn loan principal or market net realizable value of the property 
we record sales revenue and the related cost when this inventory is sold 
signature loan credit service revenue recognition we earn credit service fees when we assist customers in obtaining signature loans from unaffiliated lenders 
we initially defer recognition of the fees we expect to collect  net of direct expenses  and recognize that deferred net amount over the life of the related loans 
we reserve the percentage of credit service fees we expect not to collect 
accrued fees related to defaulted loans reduce credit service fee revenue upon loan default  and increase credit service fee revenue upon collection 
signature loan credit service revenue is included in signature loan fees on our statements of operations 
signature loan credit service bad debt we issue letters of credit to enhance the creditworthiness of our credit service customers seeking signature loans from unaffiliated lenders 
the letters of credit assure the lenders that if borrowers default on the loans  we will pay the lenders  upon demand  the principal and accrued interest owed by the borrowers plus any insufficient funds fee 
although amounts paid under letters of credit may be collected later  we charge those amounts to signature loan bad debt upon default 
we record recoveries under the letters of credit as a reduction of bad debt at the time of collection 
after attempting collection of bad debts internally  we occasionally sell them to an unaffiliated company as another method of recovery 
we account for the sale of defaulted accounts in the same manner as internal collections of defaulted accounts 
the majority of our credit service customers obtain short term signature loans with a single maturity date 
these short term loans  with maturity dates averaging about days  are considered defaulted if they have not been repaid or renewed by the maturity date 
other credit service customers obtain installment loans with a series of payments due over as much as a five month period 
if one payment of an installment loan is delinquent  that one payment is considered defaulted 
if more than one installment payment is delinquent at any time  the entire loan is considered defaulted 
allowance for losses on signature loan credit services we provide an allowance for losses we expect to incur under letters of credit for brokered signature loans that have not yet matured 
the allowance is based on recent loan default experience adjusted for seasonal variations 
it includes all amounts we expect to pay to the unaffiliated lenders upon loan default  including loan principal  accrued interest and insufficient funds fees  net of the amounts we expect to collect from borrowers expected loc losses 
changes in the allowance are charged to signature loan bad debt 
we include the balance of expected loc losses in accounts payable and other accrued expenses on our balance sheets 
at september   the allowance for expected loc losses on signature loans was million and our maximum exposure for losses on letters of credit  if all brokered signature loans defaulted and none was collected  was million 
this amount includes principal  interest and insufficient funds fees 
based on the expected loss and collection percentages  we also provide an allowance for the signature loan credit service fees we expect not to collect  and charge changes in this allowance to signature loan fee revenue 
the accuracy of our allowance estimates is dependent upon several factors  including our ability to predict future default rates based on historical trends and expected future events 
actual loan losses could vary from those estimated due to variance in any of these factors 
increased defaults and credit losses may occur during a national or regional economic downturn  in response to regulatory changes or for other reasons  resulting in the need to increase the allowance 
we believe we effectively manage these risks through our underwriting criteria and by closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio 
signature loan revenue recognition we accrue fees in accordance with state and provincial laws on the percentage of signature loans we have made that we believe to be collectible 
accrued fees related to defaulted loans reduce fee revenue upon loan default  and increase fee revenue upon collection 
loan terms are generally less than days  averaging about days 
signature loan bad debt we consider a payday loan we made defaulted if it has not been repaid or renewed by the maturity date 
if one payment of an installment loan is delinquent  that one payment is considered defaulted 
if more than one installment payment is delinquent at any time  the entire loan is considered defaulted 
although defaulted loans may be collected later  we charge the loan principal to signature loan bad debt upon default  leaving only active loans in the reported balance 
we record collections of principal as a reduction of signature loan bad debt when collected 
after attempting collection of bad debts internally  we occasionally sell them to an unaffiliated company as another method of recovery 
we account for the sale of defaulted accounts in the same manner as internal collections of defaulted accounts 
signature loan allowance for losses we provide an allowance for losses on signature loans we make that have not yet matured and related fees receivable  based on recent loan default experience adjusted for seasonal variations 
we charge any changes in the principal valuation allowance to signature loan bad debt 
we record changes in the fee receivable valuation allowance to signature loan fee revenue 
at september   the combined allowances for uncollectible principal and interest on payday loans were million 
inventory if a pawn loan is not redeemed  we record the forfeited collateral at cost 
we do not record loan loss allowances or charge offs on the principal portion of pawn loans  as they are fully collateralized 
in order to state inventory at the lower of cost specific identification or market net realizable value  we record an allowance for shrinkage and excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory 
the allowance is based on the type and age of merchandise and recent sales trends and margins 
at september   the inventory valuation allowance was million  or of gross inventory  compared to million or of gross inventory at september  we record changes in the inventory valuation allowance as cost of goods sold 
the accuracy of our inventory allowance is dependent on our ability to predict future events based on historical trends 
unexpected variations in sales margins  inventory turnover  or other factors  including fluctuations in gold values could increase or decrease our inventory allowance 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized when the rate change is enacted 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of fasb asc formerly sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we estimate the grant date fair value of options using the black scholes merton option pricing model and amortize that fair value to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the options vesting periods 
the fair value of restricted shares is measured as the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant  which is amortized over the vesting period for each grant 
we adopted fasb asc formerly sfas no 
 fair value measurements and formerly sfas no 
and  the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities on october   resulting in no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note a to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
strategic investment completed after september  on november  we acquired approximately million shares of newly issued capital stock of cash converters international limited  a public company headquartered in perth  australia  giving us ownership after the transaction 
we paid aus per share  for a total cash investment of aus million approximately million us as its largest single shareholder  we hold two of the five seats on cash converters board of directors 
cash converters franchises and operates a worldwide network of about financial services and retail stores  which provide pawn loans  short term unsecured loans  and other consumer finance products  and buy and sell used merchandise

the segment s net revenues from auto title loans were million in the current year  with bad debt at of related fees

administrative expenses in the current year were million of net revenues compared to million of net revenues in the prior year 
excluding million current year expense directly attributable to the stores acquired in november and december and a million settlement of a lawsuit in the prior year  administrative expenses increased million 
this increase was primarily due to a million rise in administrative labor and benefits as we continued to build the infrastructure to support our growth  a million software license dispute settlement  and a million increase in professional fees 
in the current year  we realized a million cash tax savings upon the exercise of stock options granted in to our chief financial officer and chairman of the board 
terms of the grants required us to pay a bonus to the executives equal to the tax savings realized 
although these items were cash neutral  the tax savings were recorded primarily as an addition to stockholders equity  while the bonus was recorded as administrative expense 
this charge is included in the current year million increase in administrative labor and benefits 
we do not expect this to recur  as no other outstanding options contain similar terms 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in the current year  compared to million in the prior year 
depreciation on assets placed in service  primarily related to acquired pawn stores and new ezmoney and empe o f cil stores  was largely offset by assets that were retired or became fully depreciated in the period

the current year s income tax expense was million of pretax income compared to million of pretax income in the prior year 
the prior year effective tax rate was lower primarily due to prior year tax credit refund claims on our investment in albemarle bond  as more fully described in note j to our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate our effective tax rate in the year ending september  will be approximately 
consolidated operating income for the current year improved million  or over the prior year to million 
contributing to this were the million  million and million increases in store operating income in our us pawn  ezmoney and empe o f cil segments and the million improvement in gain on disposal of assets  partially offset by the million higher administrative expenses

the us pawn segment fiscal total revenues increased million  or from fiscal to million 
same store total revenues increased million  or  and new and acquired stores contributed million 
the overall increase in total revenues was comprised of a million increase in merchandise and jewelry scrapping sales  a million increase in pawn service charges and a million increase in other revenues  offset by a million decrease in signature loan revenues 
in fiscal  the us pawn segment accounted for of our consolidated total revenues 
our fiscal pawn service charge revenues increased million  or from to million 
this was due to a three percentage point increase in loan yields to  coupled with a higher average pawn loan balance 
same store pawn service charges increased million or  with the remaining increase coming from acquired stores 
we estimate temporary store closures from hurricane ike in september reduced pawn service charges approximately million 
in and  we periodically raised our loan values on gold jewelry in response to increases in gold market values and similar changes by our competitors 
this contributed about million to the increase in pawn service charges in fiscal the table below summarizes our sales volume  gross profit and gross margins fiscal year ended september  dollars in millions merchandise sales jewelry scrapping sales total sales gross profit on merchandise sales gross profit on jewelry scrapping sales gross margin on merchandise sales gross margin on jewelry scrapping sales overall gross margin the fiscal merchandise gross profit increased million or from to million 
this was due to a million  or increase in same store merchandise sales and a million increase in sales from acquired stores  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in gross margins 
we estimate temporary store closures from hurricane ike in september reduced the gross profit on merchandise sales approximately million 
the gross profit on jewelry scrapping sales increased million or from fiscal to million 
this was due to a million  or increase in jewelry scrapping sales on more volume  and a percentage point increase in margins 
the jewelry scrapping sales in include the sale of approximately million of loose diamonds removed from scrapped jewelry  compared to approximately million in fiscal the proceeds refiners paid us for jewelry increased in in response to higher gold values 
we also increased the amount we loaned on jewelry and paid to purchase jewelry from customers  increasing the cost of these items 
we estimate these factors had a million positive net effect on the gross profit from jewelry scrapping sales in the segment s signature loan contribution  or fee revenue less bad debt  decreased million in fiscal  primarily due to lower average loan balances  somewhat offset by an improvement in bad debt to of fees compared to in fiscal operations expense improved to million of net revenues in fiscal from million of net revenues in fiscal  as operating expenses grew at a slower pace than the segment s net revenues 
many of our store level operating expenses are fixed 
we generally gain efficiencies by growing same store revenues and leveraging their fixed costs 
in fiscal  the million greater net revenue from pawn activities  partially offset by a million decrease in contribution from signature loans and the million higher operations expense  resulted in a million overall increase in store operating income from the us pawn operations segment compared to fiscal for the year  the segment comprised of consolidated store operating income compared to in fiscal empe o f cil segment the following table presents selected financial data for the empe o f cil segment year ended september  dollars in thousands sales pawn service charges other total revenues cost of goods sold net revenues operations expense store operating income loss other data gross margin on sales annual inventory turnover x x average pawn loan balance per pawn store at year end average inventory per pawn store at year end average yield on pawn loan portfolio a pawn loan redemption rate a average yield on pawn loan portfolio is calculated as pawn service charge revenue for the year divided by the average pawn loan balance during the year

ezmoney operations segment the following table presents selected financial data for the ezmoney operations segment year ended september  dollars in thousands signature loan fees signature loan bad debt net revenues operations expense store operating income other data signature loan bad debt as a percent of signature loan fees average signature loan balance per store offering signature loans at year end a a signature loan balances include payday loans net of valuation allowance recorded on our balance sheets and the principal portion of active brokered signature loans outstanding from unaffiliated lenders  the balance of which is not included on our balance sheets 
the ezmoney operations segment total revenues increased million  or to million in fiscal compared to this was due to a million  or same store increase and million of revenues at new stores net of closed stores 
in fiscal  the ezmoney operations segment accounted for of consolidated total revenues 
the segment s signature loan contribution  or fees less bad debt  increased million  or compared to fiscal the primary driver of the increased contribution was the addition of new stores  resulting in a increase in signature loan fee revenue 
signature loan bad debt increased million to of related fees in fiscal compared to in fiscal we believe the effects of the economic stimulus checks distributed may through july dampened demand for new loans during the period but benefited bad debt 
we estimate that power outages resulting from hurricane ike  which caused temporary closures in ezmoney stores in the houston  texas area in september  reduced signature loan fee revenues approximately million and increased bad debt approximately million  or of fee revenues for fiscal operations expense increased million in the current year to million  or of segment net revenues from million or of net revenues in the increase was mostly from additional labor  rent and other costs at new and existing stores 
included in the fiscal results is a million charge to the ezmoney segment s operating income related to the closure of eleven florida stores following a regulatory action 
approximately million was recorded as a reduction of fee revenue  and million was recorded as bad debt in based on the increase in loans that were not collected as a result of these store closures 
in fiscal  the million increase in net revenues and million greater operations expense resulted in a million net increase in store operating income from the ezmoney operations segment 
in fiscal  ezmoney operations comprised of consolidated store operating income compared to in fiscal  as operating income from the us pawn and empe o f cil segments grew at a faster pace 
other items the items discussed below affect our consolidated financial results  but are not allocated between segments 
administrative expenses in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  but remained at of net revenue 
the dollar increase was due primarily to a million increase in administrative labor and benefits  a million increase in professional fees and services  a million increase in travel and transportation expenses and a million settlement of a lawsuit with the texas attorney general 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in depreciation on assets placed in service  primarily related to new ezmoney and empe o f cil stores and acquired us pawn stores exceeded the reduction from assets that became fully depreciated or were retired 
we earned million of interest income on our invested cash in fiscal for a rate of return of 
in fiscal  we earned million of interest income on our invested cash  yielding 
with no debt in fiscal  our million interest expense represented primarily the amortization of deferred financing costs  the commitment fee on our million line of credit  and an incremental ticking fee on our new million credit facility that became effective upon the closing of the value financial services acquisition 
with no debt  interest expense of million in fiscal represented primarily the amortization of deferred financing costs and the commitment fee on our line of credit 
our equity in the net income of albemarle bond increased million from fiscal to million in primarily as a result of albemarle bond s higher earnings from same stores and from its acquisition of a competitor in july the fiscal income tax expense was million of pretax income compared to million of pretax income for fiscal in fiscal  we recognized the benefit of a previously under utilized foreign tax credit related to our investment in albemarle bond by electing to use the gross method rather than the net method in claiming this credit on our us federal taxes 
this resulted in a million reduction in income tax expense compared to what would have been recognized under the net method 
of the million total  million related to a reduction of taxes from albemarle bond s earnings and million resulted from our ability to claim the larger credit by making the same election on amended earlier tax returns and by applying the same approach to albemarle bond s undistributed earnings from earlier years 
in  we also generated a capital gain resulting in the reversal of million from the valuation allowance previously placed on a capital loss carry forward 
we also recorded a million additional tax charge related to an uncertain tax position in accordance with fasb asc formerly financial interpretation no 

the net effect of the above items caused the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal consolidated operating income for fiscal improved million to million 
contributing to this were the million  million and million increases in store operating income in our us pawn  empe o f cil and ezmoney operations segments  partially offset by the million increase in administrative expenses  million increase in depreciation and amortization  and a million loss on sale disposal of assets compared to a small gain in fiscal after a million increase in our equity interest in the earnings of albemarle bond  a million decrease in net interest income  and a million increase in income taxes and other smaller items  net income improved to million in fiscal from million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  our million cash flow from operations consisted of i net income plus several non cash items  aggregating to million  net of ii million of normal  recurring changes in operating assets and liabilities 
in fiscal  our million cash flow from operations consisted of i net income plus several non cash items  aggregating to million  net of ii million of normal  recurring changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the primary differences in cash flow from operations between the two years were an increase in collected pawn service charges and signature loan fees and an increase in the gross profit on sales of inventory  net of higher operating expenditures and taxes paid 
much of the increased cash flow was from pawn stores acquired in november and december the million of net cash used in investing activities during the current year was funded by cash flow from operations and million of borrowings net of repayments 
our most significant investments were the million of cash used in the acquisition of vfs stores including contingent consideration payments  million of cash used in the acquisition of pawnshops in the las vegas  nevada area  million of additions to property and equipment and million in loans made net of loan repayments and principal recovery through the sale of forfeited pawn collateral 
these investments were partially offset by the million of dividends received from an unconsolidated affiliate  the million proceeds from disposal of assets and million of cash and tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
in the vfs acquisition on december   we assumed vfs s million of debt 
to complete the acquisition  we borrowed million on our new credit agreement 
we subsequently retired vfs s debt and later repaid million of our term loan 
upon the closing of our new credit facility  we paid million of debt issuance costs 
in the current year  we paid million for the issuance of acquisition related stock 
the net effect of these and other smaller cash flows was a million increase in cash on hand  providing a million ending cash balance 
we used the majority of this cash and a small portion of our available line of credit to invest million in cash converters on november   as more fully discussed in note s  subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements 
we typically invest our excess cash in institutional mutual funds that hold short term  high quality investments 
at september   million of our excess funds were invested in the invesco aim premier portfolio fund and the invesco aim liquid assets portfolio fund 
these funds invest primarily in short term money market instruments that blend top tier  high quality us dollar denominated obligations  including securities issued by the us government and its agencies  bankers acceptances  certificates of deposit and time deposits from banks  repurchase agreements  commercial instruments  municipal securities and master notes 
the majority of our operating cash is held at wells fargo bank 
below is a summary of our cash needs to meet future aggregate contractual obligations in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total in addition to the contractual obligations in the table above  we are obligated under letters of credit issued to unaffiliated lenders as part of our credit service operations 
at september   our maximum exposure for losses on letters of credit  if all brokered signature loans defaulted and none was collected  was million 
at that date  our maximum exposure for losses on letters of credit  if all brokered auto title loans defaulted and none was collected  was million 
auto title loans are secured by customers automobiles 
these amounts include principal  interest  insufficient funds fees and late fees 
in addition to the operating lease obligations in the table above  we are responsible for the maintenance  property taxes  and insurance at most of our locations 
in the fiscal year ended september   these collectively amounted to million 
the operating lease obligations in the table above include expected rent for all our store locations for the full expected lease terms 
of the us ezmoney short term consumer loan stores  adjoin an ezpawn store 
the lease agreements at approximately of the remaining free standing ezmoney stores contain provisions that limit our exposure to additional rent at these stores to only a few months if laws were enacted that had a significant negative effect on our operations at these stores 
if such laws were passed  the space currently utilized by stores adjoining ezpawn stores could be re incorporated into the ezpawn operations 
in the fiscal year ending september   we plan to open to empe o f cil pawn stores in mexico  to cashmax payday loan locations in canada and six pawnshops in the united states for an expected capital expenditure of approximately million  plus the funding of working capital and start up losses at these stores 
we believe new short term consumer loan stores will create a drag on earnings and liquidity in their first six to nine months of operations before turning profitable and new pawn stores will create a drag on earnings until their second year of operations 
our syndicated credit agreement provides for  among other things  i an million revolving credit facility expiring december  that we may  under the terms of the agreement  request to be increased to a total of million and ii a million term loan maturing december  our term loan requires million quarterly principal payments 
at september   million was outstanding under the term loan  but the million revolving credit facility remained unused 
terms of the credit agreement require  among other things  that we meet certain financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all covenants at september  and expect to remain in compliance based on our expected future performance 
the payment of dividends is prohibited and additional debt is restricted under our credit agreement 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations  cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility  after considering the million we invested in cash converters on november   will be adequate to fund our contractual obligations  planned store growth  capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the coming year 
off balance sheet arrangements we issue letters of credit locs to enhance the creditworthiness of our credit service customers seeking signature loans and auto title loans from unaffiliated lenders 
the locs assure the lenders that if borrowers default on the loans  we will pay the lenders  upon demand  the principal and accrued interest owed them by the borrowers plus any insufficient funds fee or late fee 
we do not record on our balance sheet the loans related to our credit services as the loans are made by unaffiliated lenders 
we do not consolidate the unaffiliated lender s results with our results as we do not have any ownership interest in the lenders  do not exercise control over them and do not otherwise meet the criteria for consolidation as prescribed by fasb asc formerly financial interpretation no 
regarding variable interest entities 
we include an allowance for expected loc losses in accounts payable and other accrued expenses on our balance sheet 
at september   the allowance for expected loc losses was million 
at that date  our maximum exposure for losses on locs  if all brokered signature and auto title loans defaulted and none was collected  was million 
this amount includes principal  interest  insufficient funds fees and late fees 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
seasonality historically  pawn service charges are highest in our fourth fiscal quarter july through september due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season 
merchandise sales are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season  jewelry sales surrounding valentine s day and the impact of tax refunds in the united states 
jewelry scrapping sales are heavily influenced by the timing of decisions to scrap excess jewelry inventory 
jewelry scrapping sales generally are greatest during our fourth fiscal quarter july through september 
this results from relatively low jewelry merchandise sales in that quarter and the higher loan balance  leading to a higher dollar amount of loan forfeitures in the summer lending season providing more inventory available for sale 
signature loan fees are generally highest in our third and fourth fiscal quarters april through september due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season 
signature loan bad debt  both in dollar terms and as a percentage of related fees  is highest in the third and fourth quarters and lowest in the second quarter due primarily to the impact of tax refunds 
the net effect of these factors is that net revenues and net income typically are strongest in the fourth fiscal quarter and weakest in the third fiscal quarter 
our cash flow typically is greatest in the second fiscal quarter due to a high level of loan redemptions and sales in the income tax refund season
