item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of beacon federal bancorp  inc management of market risk 
strong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
in our market areas  we compete with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business  and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do  which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long term basis 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas 
if we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans  our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected 
for additional information see item business competition 
we rely on our management team for the successful implementation of our business strategy 
our future success will be largely due to the efforts of our senior management team consisting of ross j 
prossner  president and chief executive officer  j 
david hammond  senior vice president and chief lending officer and darren t 
crossett  senior vice president and chief operating officer 
the loss of services of one or more of these individuals may have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan 
we have entered into a three year employment agreement with mr 
prossner and two year employment agreements with messrs 
crossett and hammond 
our ability to successfully complete acquisitions will affect our ability to grow our franchise and compete effectively in our market areas 
we have pursued a policy of growth through acquisitions over the years  particularly in view of the slow or flat population growth in our primary market area in upstate new york 
since  we have acquired a total of ten credit unions 
in the future  we will consider the possible acquisition of other banks  thrifts  credit unions and other financial services companies or branches to supplement internal growth 
our efforts to acquire other financial institutions and financial service companies or branches may not be successful 
numerous potential acquirors exist for most acquisition candidates  creating intense competition  which affects the purchase price for which the institution can be acquired 
in many cases  our competitors have significantly greater resources than we have  and greater flexibility to structure the consideration for the transaction 
we also may not be the successful bidder in acquisition opportunities that we pursue due to the willingness or ability of other potential acquirors to propose a higher purchase price or more attractive terms and conditions than we are willing or able to propose 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities with local financial institutions  although we currently have no understandings or agreements to acquire other financial institutions 
the risks presented by the acquisition of other financial institutions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are successful in conducting acquisitions  we will be presented with many risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
an institution that we acquire may have unknown asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities that we did not discover or fully recognize in the due diligence process  thereby resulting in unanticipated losses 
the acquisition of other institutions also typically requires the integration of different corporate cultures  loan and deposit products  pricing strategies  data processing systems and other technologies  accounting  internal audit and financial reporting systems  operating systems and internal controls  marketing programs and personnel of the acquired institution  in order to make the transaction economically advantageous 
the integration process is complicated and time consuming  and could divert our attention from other business concerns and may be disruptive to our customers and the customers of the acquired institution 
our failure to successfully integrate an acquired institution could result in the loss of key customers and employees  and prevent us from achieving expected synergies and cost savings 
acquisitions also result in professional fees and may result in creating goodwill that could become impaired  thereby requiring us to recognize further charges 
we may finance acquisitions with borrowed funds  thereby increasing our leverage and reducing our liquidity  or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
our results of operations depend mainly on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest expense we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by fee income from banking operations  provisions for loan losses and other miscellaneous income 
our noninterest expense consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy  marketing  general administrative expenses and income tax expense 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly with respect to changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations

risk factors 
economic conditions 
the national economy  as well as the local economy  continue to weaken 
the economy has been marked by higher unemployment rates  rising numbers of foreclosures  declining home prices and contractions in business and consumer credit 
the national unemployment rate rose to in february from at the end of the unemployment rate in the company s market area in new york is slightly below the national average 
the federal open market committee has responded by reducing the federal funds rate from at december  to the current rate between and 
the reduction in the federal funds rate has increased the company s net interest margin and net interest income 
however  price competition for loans and deposits has increased 
financial institutions have been affected by the lack of liquidity and credit deterioration  resulting in depressed valuations and failures of certain banks 
in october  the emergency economic stabilization act of essa was enacted  providing for billion in funding to the us treasury to restore liquidity and stability to the us financial system and includes extensive tax  energy and disaster relief provisions 
in february  the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was enacted  providing for tax cuts  expansion of unemployment benefits  social welfare provisions  and spending programs for education  health care and infrastructure 
fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program 
on october   the fdic issued an interim rule  establishing the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  effective october  the tlgp consists of two components the debt guarantee program dgp  a temporary guarantee through june  of newly issued senior unsecured debt up to prescribed limits issued from october  through june  and the transaction account guarantee program tagp  a temporary guarantee of noninterest bearing transaction accounts held at fdic insured depository institutions in excess of the existing deposit insurance limit of  per account 
the company has opted out of the dgp  but is participating in the tagp 
retroactive to november   the company is assessed on a quarterly basis an annualized amount equal to basis points on the non interest bearing deposit balances exceeding the existing deposit insurance limit of  management does not expect that the assessment under the tagp will have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
operating results 
the company reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the net loss reflected the other than temporary impairment charge of million taken on our portfolio of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock  the other than temporary impairment charge of million on one collateralized mortgage obligation and two trust preferred securities  an increased provision for loan losses  and higher non interest expenses  which were partially offset by an increase in net interest income and non interest income and lower income taxes 
financial condition 
total assets increased by million to billion at december  from million at december   as a result of a million increase in net loans  a million increase in trading account assets due to the securitization of year mortgages  a million increase in securities  a million increase in fhlb of new york stock  a million increase in cash and cash equivalents and a million increase in other assets  funded by a million increase in deposits and a million increase in borrowings 
stockholders equity decreased by million due to a million increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of taxes  cash dividends of  and a net loss of million for the year ended december   partially offset by the release of esop shares in the amount of  and amortization of stock options and awards of  critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income  to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged against income 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management makes significant estimates 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses 
a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate 
appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans 
assumptions for appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance 
the assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  delinquency statistics  geographic and industry concentrations  the adequacy of the underlying collateral  the financial strength of the borrower  results of internal and external loan reviews and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions 
the analysis of the allowance for loan losses has two components specific and general allocations 
specific allocations are made for loans that are determined to be impaired 
impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or  for collateral dependent loans  the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses 
the general allocation is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan  risk weighting if applicable and payment history 
we also analyze historical loss experience  delinquency trends  general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations 
this analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general allocations 
actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established  which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
in the event management believes collection of all or a portion of contractual interest on a loan has become doubtful  which generally occurs after the loan is days past due  the accrual of interest is discontinued 
in addition  previously accrued interest deemed uncollectible that was recognized in income is reversed 
interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only if principal recovery is reasonably assured 
a nonaccrual loan is restored to accrual status when it is brought current or has performed in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time  and the collectibility of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer doubtful 
securities impairment 
we periodically perform analyses to determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of one or more of our securities 
our available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholder s equity 
our held to maturity securities portfolio  consisting of debt securities for which we have a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  is carried at amortized cost 
we conduct a quarterly review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its cost or amortized cost  and whether such decline is other than temporary 
if such decline is deemed other than temporary  we would adjust the cost basis of the security by writing down the security to estimated fair market value through a charge to current period operations 
the market values of our securities are affected by changes in interest rates and other factors  such as market liquidity 
see note to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding securities impairment 
comparison of financial condition at december  and loans  net 
net loans increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december   reflecting strong business relationships maintained by our loan staff in their local markets 
during  loan growth was experienced primarily in commercial real estate  construction  secured consumer and commercial business loans 
commercial real estate loans increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  in addition  secured consumer loans  consisting primarily of indirect automobile loans  increased by million  or  construction loans increased by million  or  and commercial business loans increased by million  or  reflecting our emphasis on the origination of these types of loans 
residential real estate and multi family loans grew modestly  while unsecured consumer and home equity loans decreased 
trading account assets 
trading account assets had a fair value of million at december   and represented the securitization of year mortgage loans 
servicing assets  included in other assets  and recourse obligations related to the securitization of loans at december  amounted to  and  respectively 
securities 
securities held to maturity decreased by million to million at december   due to principal collections on collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and mortgage backed securities 
securities available for sale increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily as a result of the purchase of mortgage backed securities and cmos  which were partially offset by the maturities of federal agency securities  a million impairment loss on freddie mac and fannie mae preferred stock  one cmo and two trust preferred securities described below  and a million increase in the net unrealized losses on available for sale securities 
the increase in securities available for sale was funded primarily from customer deposits 
during the year ended december   the company wrote down its fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock portfolio by million after determining that the portfolio was other than temporarily impaired 
the remaining preferred stock holdings were sold in december in addition  the company recorded an aggregate impairment charge of million on one cmo and two trust preferred securities 
the majority of the million net unrealized losses on available for sale securities at december  were related to cmos and pooled trust preferred securities 
these net unrealized losses were the result of increased risk premiums spreads demanded from investors due to lack of liquidity in these securities  as well as the continued turmoil in the financial markets resulting from the sub prime crisis 
the increase in spreads more than offset the decline in interest rates and was reflected in lower pricing of the portfolio as compared to a year ago 
with the exception of the write down of the one collateralized mortgage obligation and two trust preferred securities described above  management does not believe that an adverse change in the cash flows of the underlying securities had occurred as of december  accordingly  the declines in value were not considered to be other than temporary 
other assets 
federal home loan bank of new york stock increased by million to million at december   as required by the fhlb due to a higher level of mortgage related assets held by the company and limited recourse obligations related to loans sold to fhlb 
accrued interest receivable increased due to a higher balance of loans and securities outstanding and timing of interest receipts 
other assets increased by million to million at december   as a result of a higher deferred tax asset on net unrealized losses on securities available for sale  allowance for loan losses and impairment losses on securities held in the portfolio 
deposits 
deposits increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december   due to the success of promotional efforts throughout the period to attract additional deposits 
certificate of deposit accounts increased by million and represented the largest dollar increase in deposit accounts 
checking accounts and money market accounts increased by million and million  respectively 
overall  total core deposits savings  money market  non interest bearing demand and now accounts increased by million  or 
borrowings 
fhlb advances decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  securities sold under agreement to repurchase increased by million to million at december  these borrowings were used since the rates were more attractive than fhlb advances with similar terms 
accrued interest payable and other liabilities 
accrued interest payable and other liabilities increased by  to million at december  accrued interest payable on deposits increased due to a higher average balance of deposits  partially offset by a lower average rate 
other liabilities increased as a result of the timing of payments on certain other liabilities 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease reflected an increase of million in net unrealized losses on securities available for sale  less tax effect  cash dividends paid of  and a net loss of million for the year ended december   partially offset by the release of esop shares in the amount of  and amortization of stock options and awards of  comparison of operating results for the year ended december  and interest income 
interest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to higher average balances of loans and securities in compared to  as the average yield on loans decreased by basis points in compared to  reflecting lower market interest rates 
the average balances of loans and securities increased primarily as a result of the deployment of net proceeds raised in our initial public offering  which was completed in october  and proceeds from deposits and borrowings 
interest income on loans increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a higher average balance of loans  partially offset by a lower average yield 
the average balance of loans increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   reflecting our continued emphasis on loan growth 
the average yield earned on loans decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   as a result of a decline in the yield on loans indexed to the prime rate  which decreased in the generally lower market interest rate environment  which was partially offset by the greater proportion of higher yielding commercial real estate  commercial business and secured consumer loans in our loan portfolio during compared to interest income on securities increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   reflecting a higher average balance of such securities to million from million as well as higher average yields on such securities to for from for the higher average yield on securities resulted primarily from a greater weight of cmos held in the portfolio as compared to the prior year 
cmos carry a higher yield and greater degree of credit and liquidity risk than federal agency securities 
dividend income on fhlb of new york stock increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was due to a higher average balance of such stock  which was partially offset by a lower yield 
the lower yield resulted from a decrease in the dollar amount of dividends paid by the fhlb during in january  the fhlb declared a fourth quarter dividend for at an annualized rate of 
the fhlb declared a supplemental dividend of annualized for the same quarter in february interest earned on interest earning deposits at other financial institutions decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   reflecting lower yields on such interest earning assets  and to a lesser extent  lower average balances 
lower yields resulted from a decline in market investment returns on such assets 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense reflected substantially higher average balances of borrowings used to fund loan growth  which was partially offset by lower rates on deposits and borrowings 
interest expense on deposits decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   reflecting a decrease in the average rate paid on deposits to from  partially offset by a higher average balance 
lower deposit costs resulted from a decline in market interest rates 
the average balance of deposits increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the average balance of non interest bearing deposits increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  interest expense on checking and money market accounts decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as lower average rates on such accounts in compared to in were partially offset by higher average balances on such accounts million compared to million 
interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due to a lower average rate compared to  which was partially offset by a higher average balance million compared to million 
at december   we had million in brokered deposits 
brokered deposits were utilized since the rates were more attractive than local retail deposits 
brokered deposits are highly susceptible to withdrawal at maturity if the rates we pay on such deposits are not competitive 
interest expense on borrowings reverse repurchase agreements and fhlb advances increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a higher average balance of such borrowings to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as borrowings were used to supplement deposits to fund loan growth 
the average rate paid on such borrowings decreased to from as a result of a decline in market interest rates 
interest expense on fhlb advances increased to million for compared to million for  as we increased our average balances of such advances to million from million  which was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate paid on such advances to from 
the interest expense on reverse repurchase agreements increased to million from  reflecting a higher average balance of million in from million in  which more than offset a decrease in the average rate paid on such balances to in from in net interest income 
net interest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was due to an increase in net interest earning assets to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and increases in our net interest rate spread to from and net interest margin to from 
the net interest margin increased basis points due to growth in our net interest earning assets  primarily as a result of our stock offering completed in early october provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  we consider past and current loss experience  evaluations of real estate collateral  current economic conditions  volume and type of lending  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of nonperforming and other classified loans 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or economic conditions change 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for loan losses as required in order to maintain the allowance 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  compared to a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses resulted from an increase in nonperforming commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans  a higher level of commercial and consumer loan charge offs  and overall growth of the loan portfolio  particularly in commercial loans 
components of the provision for loan losses included a general allowance for each type of loan based on historical loan loss experience  and related adjustments to historical experience  and the risks associated with increased commercial lending 
the provision reflected net charge offs of million for the year ended december  compared to net charge offs of  for the year ended december  net charge offs increased due primarily to write downs on commercial business loans and consumer loans  principally secured by automobiles 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans at december   compared to million  or  of total loans at december  total nonperforming loans were million at december  compared to million at december  nonperforming loans at december  were primarily secured by commercial real estate and commercial business assets 
we used the same methodology in assessing the allowances for both years 
to the best of our knowledge  we have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable for the year ended december  and non interest income 
non interest income increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  service charges increased by  to million for the year ended december   reflecting higher deposit related fees 
commission and fee income for included income from credit life and disability insurance of  as a result of a lower experience rate of claims filed by the company s customers 
the company recognized  during the year ended december  as a result of the change in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
the company recognized a gain of  on million of year mortgages securitized and committed for sale 
in addition  the company recognized a gain of  on the sale of residential  fixed rate loans with terms of years or longer 
the company sold its remaining investment in fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock at a loss of  this loss was partially offset by a gain of  recognized on the sale of the company s equity investment in visa  inc  acquired as part of the restructuring that resulted in visa  inc issuing common stock to members of visa usa non interest expense 
non interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded an aggregate impairment loss of million on our fannie mae and freddie mac perpetual preferred stock  a collateralized mortgage obligation and two trust preferred securities 
to a lesser extent  the increase reflected higher salaries and benefits  higher occupancy and equipment expenses  higher telephone expenses  higher audit and examination expenses  higher advertising and marketing expenses  and higher other non interest expenses  which were partially offset by lower supplies expenses and provision for loss on premises and equipment and the absence of a provision for loss on foreclosed assets which was recognized during salaries and employee benefits increased by  due to normal salary increases  compensation costs related to the retirement of the company s chief financial officer on june   and  of supplemental executive retirement plan serp expense on behalf of the chief executive officer of the company and bank  approved in december  which were partially offset by upper management foregoing bonuses and lower esop expense during the serp expense will be recognized over the remaining service period of the chief executive officer based upon the present value of benefits expected to be provided under the serp 
there was no serp expense for esop expense was lower due to a decline in the market value of the company s common stock 
the company recognizes esop expense equal to the average fair values of the shares committed to be released during the year 
occupancy and equipment increased as a result of primarily higher office rent expenses  depreciation expense and equipment maintenance costs 
advertising and marketing increased as a result of a higher volume of promotions 
telephone  delivery and postage expenses increased due to switching to a new telephone and server system and temporarily operating dual phone systems 
as a result of this process  the telephone costs are expected to decrease in the near term 
supplies decreased due to lower level of periodic purchases in audit and examination expenses increased due primarily to higher professional expenses associated with our status as a public company 
other non interest expense increased due to an impairment loss of million on securities and  to a lesser extent  provision for loss on servicing assets of  due to accelerated prepayment speeds  costs incurred in conjunction with the securitization of year mortgages  higher insurance costs  subscription costs  travel costs  employee training costs  board fees  check fraud loss of  personnel recruitment costs  fees paid to outside information technology consultants  provision for losses of  on secondary market loan commitments  and expenses related to operating as a public company  including attorney s fees  securities filings related costs  annual meeting expenses  printing costs for annual reports and proxy materials  and sarbanes oxley compliance related costs 
these higher expenses were partially offset by lower correspondent bank service charges due primarily to the implementation of the check program 
on february   the fdic adopted an interim rule imposing a special assessment of basis points on the company s assessment base for the june quarter  payable september  the interim rule also permits the fdic to impose an additional special assessment of up to basis points if warranted 
the fdic adopted a final rule that increases the current initial base assessment rates to a range of to basis points  effective april  in addition  changes were made to the fdic s risk based assessment system 
regular assessments will be higher for institutions that rely on certain brokered deposits to fund rapid asset growth 
additional adjustments will be made for the company s unsecured debt and secured liabilities 
as a result of the basis point special assessment and increase in the current deposit insurance rate  management of the company estimates that the fdic premium expense will increase by approximately million for  although there can be no assurances regarding such amount 
this estimated amount could be higher if an additional special assessment is imposed and the current deposit insurance assessment increases further due to changes in the risk based assessment system 
management of the company is unable to estimate the amount of any additional assessments at this time 
in addition  the company recognized an impairment loss of  during  as a result of a decline in the fair value of certain properties sold and equipment abandoned 
the provision for loss on foreclosed assets of  was related to the write down of one property secured by an apartment complex 
income tax expense 
due to a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december   the company recognized an income tax benefit of million  compared to an expense of million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for was impacted by a higher level of non taxable boli income and dividends received deduction on fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
average balances and yields the following tables set forth average balance sheets  average yields and rates  and certain other information for the years indicated 
no tax equivalent yield adjustments were made  as the effect thereof was not material 
all average balances are monthly average balances

rate volume analysis the following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated 
the rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume 
the volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate 
the total column represents the sum of the prior columns 
for purposes of this table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume

because the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
we are vulnerable to an increase in interest rates to the extent that our interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than our interest earning assets 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has established an asset liability management committee  that is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
our interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a net interest income simulation model  which generates estimates of the change in our net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios 
the modeling assumes loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates based on historical experience and current economic conditions 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to control the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
as part of our ongoing asset liability management  we currently use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i actively market adjustable rate residential mortgage loans  ii actively market commercial business loans  which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans  and which generate customer relationships that can result in higher non interest bearing demand deposit accounts  iii lengthen the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies and through longer term wholesale funding sources such as fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank of new york and brokered deposits  iv invest in shorter to medium term securities  v sell a portion of our one to four family mortgage loans with maturities of years or more  vi use interest rate caps  as determined by the asset liability management committee  to attempt to preserve net interest income in periods of rising short term interest rates  vii originate high volumes of consumer loans  which have shorter terms  including direct and indirect automobile loans  and viii maintain high levels of capital 
net portfolio value of beacon federal 
the ots requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of an institution s cash flow from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items the institution s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the ots provides all institutions that file a consolidated maturity rate schedule as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of net portfolio value 
the ots simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measuring the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value 
historically  the ots model estimated the economic value of each type of asset  liability and off balance sheet contract under the assumption that the united states treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by to basis points in basis point increments 
however  given the current relatively low level of market interest rates  an npv calculation for an interest rate decrease of greater than basis points has not been prepared 
recently  the assumptions were expanded to include an increase and decrease of basis points 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percent  and basis points equals one percent 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
the ots provides us the results of the interest rate sensitivity model  which is based on information we provide to the ots to estimate the sensitivity of our net portfolio value 
the table below sets forth  as of december   the ots s calculation of the estimated changes in the bank s net portfolio value that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
npv as a percentage of present value of assets change in interest rates basis points estimated npv estimated increase decrease in npv npv ratio increase decrease basis points amount percent dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
the table above indicates that at december   in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  we would experience a decrease in net portfolio value 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  we would experience a decrease in net portfolio value 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value 
modeling changes in net portfolio value require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net portfolio value tables presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the net portfolio value tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results 
net interest income 
in addition to npv calculations  we analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our internal net interest income model 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
in our model  we estimate what our net interest income would be for a twelve month period using historical data for assumptions such as loan prepayment rates and deposit decay rates  the current term structure for interest rates  and current deposit and loan offering rates 
we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase or basis point decrease in market interest rates 
as of december   using our internal interest rate risk model  we estimated that our net interest income for the year ending december  would increase by in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates  and would decrease by in the event of an instantaneous basis point decrease in market interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  advances from the federal home loan bank of new york  brokered deposits  and maturities and sales of securities 
in addition  we have the ability to collateralize borrowings in the wholesale markets 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
we seek to maintain a liquidity ratio which includes wholesale funding capacity of or greater 
for the year ended december   our liquidity ratio averaged 
we believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long term liquidity needs as of december  we regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of i expected loan demand  ii expected deposit flows  iii yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and iv the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at december  on that date  we had million of federal home loan bank advances outstanding  with the ability to borrow an additional million 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had million in loan commitments outstanding 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had million in unused lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including loan sales and brokered deposits 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
our primary investing activity is originating loans 
during the year ended december   we originated million of loans  and during the year ended december   we originated million of loans 
we purchased million of securities during the year ended december   and we purchased million of securities during the year ended december  financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
we experienced a net increase in total deposits of million for the year ended december  and a net increase in total deposits of million for the year ended december  deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors  and by other factors 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
federal home loan bank advances decreased by million for the year ended december   compared to an increase of million for the year ended december  federal home loan bank advances have primarily been used to fund loan demand 
at december   we had the ability to borrow up to million from the federal home loan bank of new york 
subsequent to december   the company temporarily lost its ability to borrow additional amounts from the federal home loan bank due to loan repayments and certain payoffs 
in the near term  the company can utilize alternative sources of financing  including brokered deposits 
the company is attempting to pledge additional assets  other than single family loans and securities  in order to increase its borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank 
beacon federal is subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december   beacon federal exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
beacon federal is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see item business supervision and regulation federal banking regulation capital requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make
