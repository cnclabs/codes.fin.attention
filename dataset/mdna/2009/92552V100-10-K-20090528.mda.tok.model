item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading producer of innovative satellite and other wireless communications and networking systems to government and commercial customers 
our ability to apply technologies between government and commercial customers combined with our diversification of technologies  products and customers  provides us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced wireless communications and networking technologies 
based on our history and extensive experience in complex defense communications systems  we have developed the capability to design and implement innovative communications solutions  which enhance bandwidth utilization by applying our sophisticated networking and digital signal processing techniques 
our goal is to leverage our advanced technology and capabilities to capture a considerable share of the networking and global satellite communications equipment and services segment of the broadband communications market for both government and commercial customers 
our internal growth to date has historically been driven largely by our success in meeting the need for advanced communications products for our government and commercial customers 
by developing cost effective communications solutions incorporating our advanced technologies  we have continued to grow the markets for our products and services 
in fiscal year  we announced a change in the composition of our segments to reflect the realignment of the organization with our strategic initiatives 
we conduct our business through three segments government systems  commercial networks and satellite services 
prior fiscal year information has been recast to facilitate comparisons to the newly established reportable segments 

table of contents government systems our government business encompasses specialized products principally serving defense customers and includes data links  including mids terminals  mids joint tactical radio system mids jtrs development and uav technologies  information security and assurance products and services  which enable military and government users to communicate secure information over secure and non secure networks  and government satellite communication systems and products  including uhf dama satellite communications products consisting of modems  terminals and network control systems  and innovative broadband solutions to government customers to increase available bandwidth using existing satellite capacity 
serving government customers with cost effective products and solutions continues to be a critical and core element of our overall business strategy 
commercial networks our commercial networks segment offers an end to end capability to provide customers with a broad range of satellite communication and other wireless communications equipment solutions including consumer broadband products and solutions to customers based on docsis or dvb rcs technology  mobile broadband products and systems for airborne  maritime and ground mobile broadband applications  enterprise very small aperture terminal vsat networks products  satellite networking systems design and technology development  and antenna systems for commercial and defense applications and customers 
with expertise in commercial satellite network engineering  gateway construction and remote terminal manufacturing for all types of interactive communications services  we have the ability to take overall responsibility for designing  building  initially operating and then handing over a fully operational  customized satellite network serving a variety of markets and applications 
in addition  based on our advanced satellite technology and systems integration experience  we have developed products addressing five key broadband markets enterprise  consumer  in flight  maritime and ground mobile applications 
satellite services our satellite services segment encompasses three primary areas managed broadband services  mobile broadband services and wholesale bandwidth services 
for everyday enterprise networking or backup protection for primary networks  our managed broadband service provides a combination of terrestrial and satellite connections through an around the clock call center and network management operation to ensure customer network availability and reliable digital satellite communications 
our mobile broadband service includes network management services for our customers who utilize our arclight based mobile communication systems  also through our network management center 
in  we began construction of a high speed ka band satellite in order to provide wholesale broadband services over north america 
we currently plan to launch this satellite in early and introduce service later in sources of revenues to date  our ability to grow and maintain our revenues has depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution  and obtaining additional sizable contract awards 
due to the nature of this process  it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets 

table of contents our products are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
historically  fixed price contracts  which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price  comprised approximately of our revenues for both fiscal years and  and of our revenues for fiscal year the remainder of our annual revenue was derived from cost reimbursement contracts under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit and from time and materials contracts which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues are from contracts for the research and development of products 
the research and development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer s specific requirements and  accordingly  expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding which includes a profit component is included in revenues 
revenues for our funded research and development were approximately million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  and million or of our total revenues during fiscal year we also incur independent research and development expenses  which are not directly funded by a third party 
independent research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  supplies  prototype materials  testing and certification related to research and development programs 
independent research and development expenses were approximately  and of revenues during fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a government contractor  we are able to recover a portion of our independent research and development expenses pursuant to our government contracts 
executive summary we develop  manufacture and provide services related to satellite ground systems and other related government and commercial digital communication and networking equipment 
our products are generally highly complex and have a concept to market timeline of several months to several years 
the development of products where customers expect state of the art results requires an exceptionally talented and dedicated engineering workforce 
since inception  we have been able to attract  develop and retain engineers who support our business and customer objectives  while experiencing low turnover relative to our industry 
the consistency and depth of our engineering workforce has enabled us to develop leading edge products and solutions for our customers 
during fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of jast  sa jast  a switzerland based  privately held developer of microwave circuits and antennas for terrestrial and satellite applications  specializing in small  low profile antennas for mobile satellite communications 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of jast from the date of acquisition in our commercial networks segment 
during our fiscal years and  we completed the acquisitions of efficient channel coding  inc ecc  enerdyne technologies  inc enerdyne and intelligent compression technologies  inc ict 
the acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and accordingly  the operating results of ecc  enerdyne and ict have been included from the dates of acquisition in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment 

table of contents revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from long term contracts requiring development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications 
sales related to these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting under the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
sales and earnings under these contracts are recorded either based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract or as products are shipped under the units of delivery method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
for contract claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
during fiscal years  and  we recorded losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to loss contracts 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and future cost estimates or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
we believe we have established appropriate systems and processes to enable us to reasonably estimate future cost on our programs through regular quarterly evaluations of contract costs  scheduling and technical matters by business unit personnel and management 
historically  in the aggregate  we have not experienced significant deviations in actual costs from estimated program costs  and when deviations that result in significant adjustments arise  we would disclose the related impact in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
however  these estimates require significant management judgment and a significant change in future cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on our results of operations 
a one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed price contracts as of april  would change our income before income taxes and minority interest by approximately million 
we also have contracts and purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
in this situation  contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment  and assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements  and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized is impacted by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether sufficient objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish evidence for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation at april   we had stock based compensation plans described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we grant options to purchase our common stock and award restricted stock units to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six month offering period under our employee stock purchase plan 
the benefits provided under these plans are stock based payments subject to the provisions of revised sfas r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the fiscal year ended april  was million  million and million for employee stock options including stock options assumed in business combination  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan  respectively 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the fiscal year ended march  was million  million and million for employee stock options including stock options assumed in a business combination  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan  respectively 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the fiscal year ended march  was million  million and million for employee stock options  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan  respectively 
at april   there was million  million and million in unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options including stock options assumed in business combination  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan  respectively  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  years and less than six months  respectively 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate stock based compensation under sfas r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our stock based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee stock based awards is determined in accordance with sfas r  sab  share based payment  and sab  year end help for expensing employee stock options  using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
estimates of stock based compensation expense can be significant to our financial statements  but this expense is based on option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
the guidance in sfas r  sab and sab is relatively new and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
theoretical valuation models and market based methods are evolving and may result in lower or higher fair value estimates for stock based compensation 
the timing  readiness  adoption  general acceptance  reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain 
sophisticated mathematical models may require voluminous historical information  modeling expertise  financial analyses  correlation analyses  integrated software and databases  consulting fees  customization and testing for adequacy of internal controls 
market based methods are emerging that  if employed by us  may dilute our earnings per share and involve significant transaction fees and ongoing administrative expenses 
the uncertainties and costs of these extensive valuation efforts may outweigh the benefits to investors 

table of contents our expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate 
the estimated volatility for stock options and employee stock purchase rights is based on the historical volatility calculated using the daily stock price of our stock over a recent historical period equal to the expected term 
the risk free interest rate that we use in determining the fair value of our stock based awards is based on the implied yield on united states treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term of our stock based awards 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the calculation using the simplified method for plain vanilla options applied consistently to all plain vanilla options  consistent with the guidance in sab in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued sab to amend the sec s views discussed in sab regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of options in accordance with sfas r 
due to significant changes in our option terms in october of and lack of sufficient history  we will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life in accordance with sab  as amended by sab for the expected option life  we have what sab defines as plain vanilla stock options  and therefore use a simple average of the vesting period and the contractual term for options as permitted by sab the weighted average expected life of employee stock options granted during the fiscal year ended april   derived from the simplified method was years 
the expected term or life of employee stock purchase rights issued represents the expected period of time from the date of grant to the estimated date that the stock purchase right under our employee stock purchase plan would be fully exercised 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable based on historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
historically  our bad debts have been minimal  a contributing factor to this is that a significant portion of our sales has been to the united states government 
more recently  commercial customers have comprised a larger part of our revenues 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of april   and our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of march  warranty reserves we provide limited warranties on our products for periods of up to five years 
we record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products or they are included in long term construction contracts based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs 
amounts expected to be incurred within twelve months are classified as a current liability 
for mature products  we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product 
for newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs  we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failures that may occur 
it is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience  and in that case  we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for our goodwill under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the sfas goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
reporting units within our government systems and commercial networks segments have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value  if any  represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows and other indicators of fair value 
we base the forecast of future cash flows on our best estimate of the future revenues and operating costs  which we derive primarily from existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could cause a particular reporting unit to either pass or fail the first step in the sfas goodwill impairment model  which could significantly influence whether a goodwill impairment needs to be recorded 
we adjust the cash flow forecasts by an appropriate 
table of contents discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
in applying the first step  which is identification of any impairment of goodwill  no impairment of goodwill has resulted 
property  equipment and satellite equipment  computers and software  furniture and fixtures and our satellite under construction are recorded at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
costs are capitalized as incurred and for our satellite include construction  launch and insurance 
satellite construction costs  including launch services and insurance  are generally procured under long term contracts that provide for payments by us over the contract periods 
satellite construction and launch services costs are capitalized to reflect progress toward completion  which typically coincides with contract milestone payment schedules 
insurance premiums related to satellite launches and subsequent in orbit testing are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the satellite 
performance incentives payable in future periods are dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellite in service 
impairment of long lived assets property  equipment and satellite  and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess potential impairments to our long lived assets  including property  equipment and satellite and other intangible assets  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets are less than the asset s carrying value 
any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
we have not identified any such impairment 
income taxes management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
on march   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of business there are calculations and transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in addition  changes in tax laws and regulations as well as adverse judicial rulings could adversely affect the income tax provision 
we believe we have adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
however  if these provided amounts prove to be more than what is necessary  the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine that provision for the liabilities is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense would result 
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with sfas  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we maintained a valuation allowance of million and million against deferred tax assets at april  and march   respectively  relating to state net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards available to reduce state income taxes

increased revenues were experienced in our government systems segment  which increased by million  and our satellite services segment  which increased by million  offset by a decrease in our commercial networks segment of million 
the revenue increase in our government systems segment was primarily derived from higher sales of million in information assurance products and development programs  million in next generation military satellite communication systems and million in video data link systems  offset by a decrease in sales of million in next generation tactical data link development and a decrease of million in sales from our majority owned subsidiary  trellisware 
our satellite services segment revenue increase of approximately million was primarily derived from service arrangements supporting both the mobile broadband and enterprise managed networks services markets

the lower ir d expenses were principally due to a shift of some of our efforts from internal development projects to customer funded development 
amortization of intangible assets the intangible assets from prior acquisitions are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from eight months to ten years 
the amortization of intangible assets will decrease each year as the intangible assets with shorter lives become fully amortized 
the expected amortization expense of long lived acquired intangible assets for the next five fiscal years is as follows amortization in thousands expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year thereafter interest income interest income decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due to lower interest rates on our investments and lower average invested cash balances during year over year

segment operating profit dollar percentage fiscal years ended increase increase march  march  decrease decrease in millions  except percentages segment operating profit percentage of segment revenues 
table of contents operating profit growth of million in our commercial networks segment was primarily driven by improved performance of consumer broadband products  which contributed to product cost reductions of approximately million year over year 
this was offset by a decrease in operating profit associated with reduced enterprise vsat product sales and an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
satellite services segment revenues dollar percentage fiscal years ended increase increase march  march  decrease decrease in millions  except percentages revenues our satellite services segment experienced revenues relatively flat year over year 
these revenues were primarily derived from service arrangements supporting both the mobile broadband and enterprise managed networks services markets 
segment operating loss dollar percentage fiscal years ended increase increase march  march  decrease decrease in millions  except percentages segment operating loss percentage of segment revenues the increase in satellite services segment operating losses of million was primarily driven by the write off of a certain receivable due to a customer bankruptcy in our managed broadband services business 
backlog total new awards for us were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year new contract awards in fiscal year were a record for the company 
as reflected in the table below  both funded and firm backlog increased during fiscal year primarily due to some expected large contract awards that we began pursuing in fiscal year and for which negotiations were completed in fiscal year april  march  in millions firm backlog government systems segment commercial networks segment satellite services segment total funded backlog government systems segment commercial networks segment satellite services segment total contract options the firm backlog does not include contract options 
of the million in firm backlog  approximately million is expected to be delivered in fiscal year  and the balance is expected to be delivered in fiscal year and thereafter 
we include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders 

table of contents backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales 
a majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer 
orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery  and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties 
in addition  purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development 
a failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related contract 
firm backlog amounts as presented are comprised of funded and unfunded components 
funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts 
unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods 
our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long term contracts on a periodic basis 
our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts 
although we do not control the funding of our contracts  our experience indicates that actual contract fundings have ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations  bank line of credit financing and equity financing 
the general cash needs of our government systems  commercial networks and satellite services segments can vary significantly and depend on the type and mix of contracts in backlog ie  product or service  development or production  and timing of payments  the quality of the customer ie  government or commercial  domestic or international and the duration of the contract 
in addition  for all three of our segments  program performance significantly impacts the timing and amount of cash flows 
if a program is performing and meeting its contractual requirements  then the cash flow requirements are usually lower 
the cash needs of the government systems segment tend to be more a function of the type of contract rather than customer quality 
also  united states government procurement regulations tend to restrict the timing of cash payments on the contract 
in the commercial networks and satellite services segments  our cash needs are driven primarily by the quality of the customer and the type of contract 
the quality of the customer can affect the specific contract cash flow and whether financing instruments are required by the customer 
in addition  the commercial networks and satellite services financing environments tend to provide for more flexible payment terms with customers  including advance payments 
in january  we announced plans to have our high capacity viasat satellite constructed and to develop the related ground network equipment 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year of million 
the increase of million in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributed to additional net operating asset conversions to cash of million and higher year over year net income of million 
combined billed and unbilled accounts receivable  net  increased by million from prior fiscal year end due to a million increase in our commercial networks segment and a million increase in our satellite services segment  offset by a million decrease in our government systems segment spread across various customers 
collections in excess of revenue included in accrued liabilities decreased approximately million as we progressed towards completion of certain larger development projects and recorded the related revenues  as well as the timing of any additional milestones billings 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in investing activities in fiscal year of million 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the construction costs of our viasat satellite of approximately million and other additional capital expenditures for equipment of approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million of total capital expenditures in fiscal year in addition  cash used in investing activities in fiscal year included  in connection with the terms of our jast acquisition  the cash payment of the remaining portion of the initial purchase price of approximately million on the first anniversary of the closing date 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal year included million paid in cash to certain former ecc stockholders under the terms of the acquisition agreement for ecc  million in cash paid for the acquisition of jast on the closing date under the terms of the jast acquisition agreement  and million paid in cash to former stockholders of enerdyne under the terms of the enerdyne acquisition agreement 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million as compared to million for fiscal year the approximate million decrease in cash inflows for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily related to the million repayment of our secured borrowing at the beginning of fiscal year  offset by million in cash receipts related to the sale of stock in our majority owned subsidiary  trellisware 
during april  trellisware issued additional shares of preferred stock and received million in cash proceeds from other principal stockholders 
we also invested million in order to maintain the level of 
table of contents our percentage ownership interest 
in addition  cash provided by financing activities for both periods included cash received from stock option exercises  employee stock purchase plan purchases and cash inflows related to the incremental tax benefit from stock based compensation  slightly offset by the repurchase of common stock related to net share settlement of certain employee tax liabilities in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards 
in january  we entered into several agreements with space systems loral  inc ss l  loral space communications  inc 
loral and telesat canada telesat related to our high capacity satellite system 
under the satellite construction contract with ss l  we purchased a new broadband satellite viasat designed by us and currently under construction by ss l for approximately million  subject to purchase price adjustments based on satellite performance 
the total cost of the satellite is million  but  as part of the satellite purchase arrangements  loral executed a separate contract with ss l whereby loral is purchasing the canadian beams on the viasat satellite for approximately million of the total satellite cost 
we have entered into a beam sharing agreement with loral  whereby loral has agreed to reimburse us for of the total costs associated with launch and launch insurance  for which the reimbursement amount is estimated to be approximately million  and in orbit insurance and satellite operating costs post launch 
in november  we entered into a launch services agreement with arianespace to procure launch services for the viasat satellite at a cost estimated to be million  depending on the mass of the satellite at launch 
in march  we substituted ils international launch services  inc for arianespace as the primary provider of launch services for viasat and  accordingly  we entered into a contract for launch services with ils to procure launch services for the viasat satellite at an estimated cost of approximately million  subject to certain adjustments  resulting in a net savings of approximately million on the viasat satellite 
on may   we entered into an amended and restated launch services agreement with arianespace 
under the terms of the amended and restated launch services agreement  arianespace has agreed to perform certain launch services to maintain the launch capability for the viasat high capacity satellite  should the need arise  or for launch services of a future viasat satellite launch prior to december this amendment and restatement also provides for certain cost adjustments depending on fluctuations in foreign currencies  mass of the satellite launched and launch period timing 
the projected total cost of the viasat project  including the satellite  launch  insurance and related gateway infrastructure  through in service of the satellite is estimated to be approximately million  and will depend on the timing of the gateway infrastructure roll out 
we continually evaluate alternative strategies that would limit our total required investment 
we believe we have adequate sources of funding for the project  which includes our cash on hand  the cash we expect to generate from operations over the next few years  and additional borrowing ability based on our financial position and low debt leverage ratio 
we believe this provides us flexibility to execute this project in an appropriate manner and or obtain outside equity in the range indicated under terms that we consider reasonable 
we invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
at april   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
at march   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions 
to date  we have experienced no loss of access to our cash equivalents  however  there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
on october   we entered into a three year million revolving credit facility the credit facility in the form of the third amended and restated revolving loan agreement  which replaced an existing million revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are permitted up to a maximum amount of million  including up to million of letters of credit  and bear interest  at our option  at either a the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the administrative agent s prime rate as announced from time to time  or b at the london interbank offered rate plus  in the case of each of a and b  an applicable margin that is based on the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property 
at april   we had million outstanding under standby letters of credit  leaving borrowing availability under the credit facility of million 
the credit facility contains financial covenants regarding a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
in addition  the credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  sell assets  make investments and acquisitions  make capital expenditures  grant liens  pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments 

table of contents to further enhance our liquidity position  we may increase our existing credit facility or raise additional capital  which could consist of debt  convertible debt or equity financing from public and or private capital markets 
in april  we filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  for the future sale of up to an additional million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants  bringing the aggregate available under our universal shelf registration statements to up to million 
the securities may be offered from time to time  separately or together  directly by us or through underwriters at amounts  prices  interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
the sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing and amount of cash required for the viasat satellite project pursuant to our contractual commitments  other future broadband satellite projects we may engage in  expansion of our research and development and marketing efforts  and the nature and timing of orders 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in complementary businesses  products and technologies which may require the use of cash 
we believe that our current cash balances and net cash expected to be provided by operating activities along with availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our obligations under operating leases  irrevocable letters of credit  purchase commitments and other long term liabilities for the periods indicated for the fiscal years ending total thereafter in thousands operating leases standby letters of credit purchase commitments including satellite related agreements total we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several subcontractors and contract manufacturers to provide design and manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with subcontractors  contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements 
we have also entered into agreements with suppliers for the construction  operation and launch of our viasat satellite 
in addition  we have contracted for an additional launch which can be used as a back up launch for our viasat satellite or for a future satellite 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
consequently  only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable and unconditional commitments 
our consolidated balance sheets as of april  and march  include million and million  respectively  classified as other liabilities 
this caption primarily consists of our long term warranty obligations  deferred lease credits and long term unrecognized tax position liabilities 
these remaining liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas fsp sfas  application of fasb statement no 
to fasb statement no 
and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurement for purpose of lease classification of measurement under statement  which amends sfas to exclude accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purpose of lease classification or measurement under sfas  accounting for leases 
in february  the fasb also issued fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas until the first fiscal year that begins after november  our fiscal year for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas was effective for financial assets and liabilities beginning fiscal year we adopted this standard for financial assets and liabilities in the current fiscal year without any material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas may have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures when it is applied to non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis beginning in first quarter of fiscal year in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations 
the purpose of issuing the statement is to replace current guidance in sfas to better represent the economic value of a business combination transaction 
the changes to be effected with sfas r from the current guidance include  but are not limited to acquisition costs will be recognized as expenses separately from the acquisition  known contractual contingencies at the time of the acquisition will be considered part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value  all other contingencies will be part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of a liability  contingent consideration based on the outcome of future events will be recognized and measured at the time of the acquisition  business combinations achieved in stages step acquisitions will need to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as non controlling interests  in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values  and a bargain purchase defined as a business combination in which the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any non controlling interest in the acquiree will require that excess to be recognized as a gain attributable to the acquirer 
sfas r will be effective for us in fiscal year the standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after april   except that resolution of certain tax contingencies and adjustments to valuation allowances related to business combinations  which previously were adjusted to goodwill  will be adjusted to income tax expense for all such adjustments after april   regardless of the date of the original business combination 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas r may have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which changes the accounting and reporting for business acquisitions and non controlling interests in subsidiaries 
the standard was issued to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of financial information provided to investors 
moreover  sfas eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and non controlling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
sfas will be effective for us in fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas may have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
in april  the fasb issued three fsps to address concerns about measuring the fair value of financial instruments when the markets become inactive and quoted prices may reflect distressed transactions  recording impairment charges on investments in debt instruments and requiring the disclosure of fair value of certain financial instruments in interim financial statements 
the first fsp  fsp sfas  determining whether a market is not active and a transaction is not distressed  provides additional guidance to highlight and expand on the factors that should be considered in estimating fair value when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for a financial asset 
the second fsp  fsp sfas and fsp sfas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  changes the method for determining whether an other than temporary impairment exists for debt securities and the amount of an impairment charge to be recorded in earnings 
the third fsp  fsp sfas and accounting principles board opinion apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments increases the frequency of fair value disclosures from annual  to quarterly 
all three fsps are effective for interim periods ending after june   with the option for early adoption in interim periods ending after march  we did not elect early adoption and do not expect that the adoption of the fsps in the first quarter of fiscal year will have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable  and short term and long term obligations  including the revolving line of credit 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
as of april   our revolving credit facility was undrawn and we held no short term investments 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to cash equivalents and short term investments 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a significant portion of our cash balance in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
our cash and cash equivalents earn interest at variable rates 
given recent declines in interest rates  our interest income has been and may continue to be negatively impacted 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by basis points in fiscal year  interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
because our investment policy restricts us to invest in conservative  interest bearing investments and because our business strategy does not rely on generating material returns from our investment portfolio  we do not expect our market risk exposure on our investment portfolio to be material 
to the extent that we draw against our revolving credit facility  increases in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
foreign exchange risk we generally conduct our business in united states dollars 
however  as our international business is conducted in a variety of foreign currencies and we pay some of our vendors in euros  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency exchanges is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  from time to time  we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of april   we had no foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding
