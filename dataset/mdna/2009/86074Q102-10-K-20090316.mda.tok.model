item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and notes  included elsewhere in this report  and the information contained in part ii  item selected financial and operating data 
overview principal factors affecting stillwater mining company stillwater mining company is a delaware corporation  listed on the new york stock exchange and based in montana 
the company mines  processes  refines and markets platinum and palladium ores from two underground mines situated within the j m reef  an extensive trend of pgm mineralization located in stillwater and sweet grass counties in south central montana 
the mined ore is crushed and concentrated in a mill at each of the mine sites and then trucked to columbus  montana  where the concentrates are further processed into a pgm rich filter cake 
the filter cake then is shipped to third parties for final refining into finished metal 
pgm ore grades in the j m reef are some of the best in the world  but because of the uplifted configuration of the reef  they also are costly and complex to mine 
the mines compete primarily with pgm ore reserves in the republic of south africa  which generally are much higher in platinum content and less steeply dipping  and with nickel mines in the russian federation which produce pgms as a major by product and so at a very low marginal cost 
consequently  in periods of low pgm prices  stillwater mining company s palladium rich production ratio and cost structure may put it at a disadvantage to these competitors 
see business and properties risk factors the company is a relatively high cost primary producer for further discussion of this issue 
in the fourth quarter  as a result of a sharp decrease in pgm prices and in light of the impact of the worldwide financial crisis  the company restructured its operations in an effort to conserve cash and reduce anticipated losses 
the restructuring of the company s operations resulted in a dramatic change and essentially reduced the scope of its mining operations 
the company recognized that the combined effect of low pgm prices  the upcoming expiration of its automobile contracts containing floors on pricing and reduced demand for its metals would significantly impact the company 
the company believes that it is in the interests of shareholders for management to seek to maintain some stability in its operations while looking forward to a turnaround in pricing and the markets  as to which there can be no assurance 
in the current pricing environment  the company s mining operations are not profitable 
the company reported a loss of million in the fourth quarter  which includes an impairment charge against the carrying value of one of its mining properties and other non cash charges 
the deterioration in the pgm markets during the fourth quarter required the company to test its facilities for impairment 
the result of their assessment was that the fair value of the east boulder mine was million lower than its carrying value on the company s books  thus resulting in the impairment charge 
the stillwater mine was not impaired 
see business and properties risk factors 
in response to the decrease in pgm prices the company briefly suspended work at its east boulder mine in the fourth quarter in order to consider operating alternatives 
weighing the options there  management determined that if the lower pgm market prices proved to be a temporary deviation from the longer term pricing trend  closing the mine would create a loss of skilled miners and technical staff 
when the mine reopened in early december  it was on a restructured basis consistent with the lower prices 
at the same time  a significant number of east boulder miners were transferred to the stillwater mine  where there were opportunities to utilize them productively to replace higher cost contractors 
the changes also resulted in substantial employee layoffs across the company 
during the fourth quarter  the company recorded a million provision for the restructuring 
if the market price of pgms falls further or remains below production costs for a sustained period  losses may continue to be sustained and  under certain circumstances  there may be additional curtailments or suspension of some or all of stillwater s mining and exploration activities 
the company must continue to assess the economic impact of any sustained lower pgm prices on recoverability and  therefore  the cut off grade and level of its reserves and resources 
these factors could have an adverse impact on its future cash flows  earnings  results of operations  stated reserves  financial condition  ability to repay debt  and ability to continue as a going concern 

table of contents most of the production from the company s mines is sold under long term sales agreements to ford motor company and general motors corporation for use in automotive catalytic converters 
the automotive contracts include floor and  in some cases  ceiling prices on palladium and platinum 
the larger of these contracts expires at the end of  and the other will expire at the end of under its automotive sales agreements  the company now has committed of its mined palladium production and of its mined platinum production through  and at least of its palladium production in and unless these contracts are renewed under similarly favorable terms  once these contracts expire the company will be fully exposed to the volatility of pgm market prices 
since  the major us bond rating agencies have steadily downgraded the corporate ratings of ford motor company and general motors corporation  reflecting the substantial deterioration in their credit status 
federal financial assistance to automotive manufacturers cannot be assured and pressures for the restructuring or combination among manufacturers may increase  with potentially negative impacts on the company 
under applicable law  if one or both of these companies should become insolvent or file for protection under the bankruptcy statutes  their respective obligations under the pgm supply agreements with the company could be voided 
the deterioration of the credit of these two customers  and the upcoming expiration of these supply contracts  particularly in light of recent low pgm market prices  has highlighted the company s dependence on the above market pricing provisions in the automotive contracts 
the company also recycles spent catalyst materials through its processing facilities in columbus  montana  recovering palladium  platinum and rhodium from these materials 
the recycling segment has proven to be a very attractive and profitable ancillary business that utilizes surplus capacity in the company s smelting and refining facilities 
however  it also entails certain risks 
three of the primary risks are collectibility of advances to suppliers  inability to hedge these advances effectively and fluctuation in the volume of material received 
the recycling segment requires the company to advance against third party inventory purchases and to carry large working inventories for extended periods until processing is completed and the final metals are released 
as such  it creates collection exposures and requires significant investments in working capital that draw against the company s liquidity balances 
in light of the sharp decline in pgm prices during the second half of and the worldwide financial and credit crises  volumes of recycling materials available in the marketplace have diminished substantially in response to lower pgm prices 
these lower recycling volumes result in less earnings and cash flow from the recycling segment  and therefore less economic support for the mining operations 
should it become necessary to reduce or suspend operations at the mines for economic reasons  whether because of limited recycling support or otherwise  the proportion of operating costs allocated to the recycling segment could increase  making the recycling segment less competitive 
further  the ability to operate the smelter and refinery without significant volumes of mine concentrates would likely require modification to the processing facilities 
while management believes it can operate these facilities in a profitable manner  there is no assurance that the recycling facilities can operate profitably in the absence of significant concentrates from the mines  or that capital would be available to complete necessary modifications to the processing facilities 
the company has taken a non cash charge of million on its advances on inventory purchases related to its recycling segment 
see business and properties risk factors 
the company is in the process of determining what changes can be made to minimize risk in the advance process  while at the same time continuing to support and further the recycling segment as it is complementary to its mining operations and can be very profitable if the risks can be controlled 
in acquiring recycled automotive catalysts  the company regularly advances funds to its suppliers in order to facilitate its procurement efforts 
at this time the company s recycling segment is substantially dependent upon one such supplier 
the company works closely with its suppliers in an effort to monitor this business and the related advances 
a portion of these advances is secured by material in supplier inventory  but a substantial portion is not secured and remains at risk 
see business and properties risk factors reliance on third parties for sourcing of recycling materials and the concentration of recycling sources creates the potential for losses for additional detail 
on march   the company issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due debentures 
the debentures pay interest at per annum  payable semi annually on march and september of each year  commencing september  the debentures will mature on march   subject to earlier repurchase or conversion 
each  principal amount of debentures is initially convertible  at the option of the holders  into approximately shares of the company s common stock  at any time prior to the maturity date 
the conversion rate is subject to certain adjustments  but will not be adjusted for accrued interest or any unpaid interest 
the conversion rate initially represents a conversion price of per share 
holders of the debentures may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain events including a change in control 
the company may redeem the debentures for cash beginning on or after march  
table of contents mmc norilsk nickel  a russian mining company  is majority owner of the company  with about a shareholding interest 
norilsk nickel acquired this interest in june  purchasing a interest with million in cash and  ounces of palladium metal  and then tendered in the market for additional shares 
the company subsequently sold off the norilsk nickel palladium ratably over a month period that concluded in the first quarter of norilsk nickel purchased debentures from the company as part of the offering in order to maintain its proportionate equity ownership 
under a shareholders agreement entered into at the time of the acquisition  norilsk nickel is currently entitled to nominate five of the company s nine directors 
results and commentary in total  the company reported a net loss of million for the full year  compared to a loss of million in the results included a loss of million in the fourth quarter  compared to net income of million in the fourth quarter of the results include charges of million including a million impairment adjustment at the east boulder mine  million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment  a million write down on advances on inventory purchases  a million write down of trade receivables  a million charge to mark long term investments to current market  and a million provision for corporate restructuring 
the results and charges reflect the steep deterioration in prices during the final quarter of  for platinum group metals pgms  the company s principal products and the steep downturn of the economy 
at the same time during the fourth quarter the company s available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments excluding restricted cash increased by million  driven mostly by reductions in working capital required for the recycling segment 
a detailed comparison of these outcomes is presented below in results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  during  the company s mining operations produced a total of  ounces of palladium and platinum  including  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum  falling short of its updated mine production guidance for of between  and  ounces 
the restructuring at the east boulder mine during the fourth quarter  and lower realized grades than planned at the stillwater mine late in the year contributed to this production shortfall 
in  the company processed  ounces of recycled pgms in its smelting and refining facilities  a increase over the  total ounces processed in the processing of recycled materials benefits from the nickel and copper sulfides in mine concentrates  which act as collecting agents 
in the company entered into an agreement with a major us collector of catalytic converters to purchase substantial volumes for processing 
this agreement has since been modified and extended to facilitate expansion of these activities 
in  the company entered into a second supply agreement with another supplier  although the volumes committed under the second agreement are significantly less than the first 
the specific commercial terms of these agreements are confidential 
capital spending declined somewhat in  although the company continued its program to extend the developed state of both mines 
this effort includes increasing proven ore reserves and expanding infrastructure to facilitate a move toward more efficient production 
actual capital expenditures of million were about million below the company s updated guidance for the year of million 
the expenditures include about million for a second electric furnace at the smelter in columbus 
the furnace is expected to begin commissioning during the first quarter of the shortfall in actual expenditures compared to guidance primarily reflected significant cuts in spending mandated during the fourth quarter in order to conserve cash 
results from the fourth quarter of stand out in stark contrast to the first three quarters of the year 
early in  shortages of electrical power and other operational problems curtailed mine production of pgms in south africa  driving the market price for platinum to record levels it peaked in march on the lme at  per ounce with palladium following directionally and peaking at per ounce 
the shortage of physical metal was compounded by very strong investor interest  as commodity returns suddenly looked very attractive in an otherwise lackluster market 
stillwater s average realized pgm prices on mine output for the first nine months of  which include the effect of floor and ceiling prices in the auto contracts and some hedging losses on platinum in the first half  were  per ounce for platinum and per ounce for palladium 
at these strong price levels  the company reported net earnings for the first nine months of of million and ebitda of almost million 
this bullish market environment ended abruptly in the fourth quarter of as credit markets imploded  automotive sales withered and large investors cycled out of their commodity investments into cash  the market price of platinum and palladium tumbled to levels not seen since platinum bottomed on the lme at per ounce and 
table of contents palladium at per ounce in the quarter  before recovering somewhat by the end of the year 
with these much lower prices  the company s profitability evaporated  despite realizing significant benefit from the palladium floor price provisions in the automotive contracts 
average realizations on mine production in the fourth quarter were per ounce for palladium and per ounce for platinum 
typically  the company s mines produce about times as much palladium as platinum  a relationship driven by the relative percentages of the two metals in the ore and by metal recoveries achieved during processing 
the company s average realization per sold ounce on combined platinum and palladium sales from mining of per ounce during the first nine months of declined to per ounce in the fourth quarter of putting this in perspective  the company s mining cost of sales for the first nine months of including depreciation and amortization expense was equivalent to per ounce comfortably profitable 
however  in the fourth quarter  which included some large inventory adjustments  mining cost of sales increased to the equivalent of per sold ounce a loss rate on mining operations in excess of per sold ounce 
early in the fourth quarter  management recognized the urgent need to make substantial changes in the face of potential heavy losses and concluded that its first objective would be to balance cash inflows and outflows 
the focus on cash led to a number of natural decisions 
the east boulder mine  which typically has lower ore grades than the stillwater mine  historically has reported higher total cash costs per ounce a non gaap measure of extraction efficiency discussed above under reconciliation of non gaap measures to costs of revenues and clearly was not competitive at the reduced pgm market prices 
weighing the options there  management determined that if the lower pgm market prices in the fourth quarter proved to be a temporary deviation from the longer term pricing trend  closing the mine would create a loss of skilled miners and technical staff foreclosing the opportunity to respond quickly to price recovery in the future 
staff at the mine assessed several different approaches and concluded that the mine could potentially be made competitive by using a leaner  team based mining approach  with each team more or less self sufficient and focused on its specific mining area  and by cutting back development to only what was absolutely necessary to support current operations particularly if prices improved at least modestly going forward 
this alternative was considered preferable to suspending mining operations altogether  and included the added benefit of allowing the stillwater mine to fully staff its mining operations and replace higher cost mining contractors by transferring skilled miners from the east boulder mine 
regrettably  it also entailed terminating over employees at east boulder mine 
these changes were implemented in december 
various other broad based changes were implemented at about the same time to conserve corporate cash 
capital expenditures and all discretionary expenditures were cut back sharply 
staffing at all locations was revisited in an effort to bring support costs into line with recent lower production levels 
contractors were replaced by company employees wherever feasible 
the corporate office in billings was closed  with corporate staff reassigned to offices in columbus or at the mines 
the project to install a second electric furnace at the smelter was reviewed  but was deemed far enough along and of sufficient strategic importance that it should be completed with elements of the project restructured to save costs 
and purchasing arrangements with suppliers were addressed to ensure competitive pricing terms 
efforts to improve mining efficiency and productivity  which were initiated earlier in the year  are also viewed as critical and have continued 
these include cross functional study teams to address maintenance  underground logistics and supply  mining processes  purchasing and warehousing  and information systems 
these teams meet regularly to review opportunities for improvement and to strengthen coordination and communication among various functions 
along with the mining changes  the volume of material received for recycling also dropped off sharply during the fourth quarter in response to much lower prices 
it appears that some recycling collectors are simply not collecting at the current prices  others determined to withhold material from the market hoping for better pricing in the future  while others suffered significant inventory losses in the falling market and have exited the industry 
from a cash perspective  the lower pgm market prices and reduced volumes of recycling material from recycling suppliers and vendors have resulted in large amounts of the company s working capital in inventory and advances freeing up and being converted to cash 
this cash from recycling inventories is likely to be needed for working capital when the recycling segment recovers  and so is segregated out when assessing whether the company s operations are remaining cash neutral 
the company also has reported a lower of cost or market inventory adjustment of million on its recycling segment for the fourth quarter 
the company s business model for recycling includes locking in a positive margin on each lot of material at the time it is purchased by selling the contained pgms forward in the futures market 
this 
table of contents underlying model has not changed 
consequently  the inventory loss shown is a timing matter  as a lower of cost or market inventory adjustment accelerates cost recognition in a falling market 
the company s reported fourth quarter and full year losses also include several other accounting adjustments that resulted from lower pgm market prices 
the company has not historically recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts because it has only a few large customers and its collection history is strong 
however  with the sharp downturn in metal prices  several of the company s smaller customers have not been able to make timely payments 
accordingly  the company has written off million of the receivable balance at december   due to the uncertainty of ultimate repayment 
the company similarly has had to roll forward certain commitments from its suppliers associated with a portion of its advances on inventory purchases  as the volumes in that market have contracted sharply 
a portion of these advances to the suppliers is collateralized 
however  the company believes that performance under the contracts is unlikely unless and until market conditions improve  and consequently the company has taken a write down of million on its advances on inventory purchases related to its recycling segment 
in conjunction with the restructuring at the east boulder mine and associated employee terminations during the fourth quarter  the company has recorded a corporate restructuring charge of million in its fourth quarter results 
this charge includes severance and warn act payments  other accrued obligations to terminated employees  final payments to contractors  and costs associated with moving the billings corporate office 
lower prices also can affect the economic justification of ore reserves  and the company has reviewed its ore reserves at december  as in past years  the company also engaged behre dolbear as third party independent geological experts to review and express their opinion on the company s reserve calculations 
the company performs its ore reserve economic assessment using a twelve quarter trailing price in order to level out short term volatility in metals prices  regarding the twelve quarter trailing average as a reasonable surrogate for long term future pgm prices over the period when the reserves will be mined 
the combined twelve quarter trailing weighted average price for platinum and palladium at december   was about per ounce 
at this price  the company s geologic ore reserves at each mine can be shown to generate undiscounted positive cash flow over the life of the reserve 
consequently  the company s ore reserves were not constrained economically at december  it is important to note that  if current low pgm prices should continue for an extended period  the trailing twelve quarter price will gradually decline 
following the company s methodology  there can be no assurance that the company s reported proven and probable ore reserves will not be constrained economically in the future 
the company is endeavoring to ensure that its operations at current prices  excluding unusual items  are generating positive cash flow 
the company also has assessed the carrying value of its assets for impairment at december  the company determined  following the process described in sfas no 
 that events and changes in circumstances during the fourth quarter indicated the possibility of impairment 
based on current mine plans and an assessment of long term pricing  the company determined that undiscounted future cash flows at the stillwater mine are sufficient to return the carrying value  but the undiscounted future cash flows projected at east boulder mine are not sufficient to cover the carrying value there 
consequently  with the assistance of behre dolbear  the company assessed the fair value of the east boulder mine assets and concluded that a valuation adjustment was needed at east boulder 
accordingly  the company s reported earnings at december   include a million impairment charge reducing the carrying value of the east boulder mine assets to million 
both moody s investors service and standard and poor s downgraded the company s corporate credit rating by two notches during this was in addition to a downgrade in december at issue is the company s strong dependence on contracts with ford and general motors  lack of geographic or product diversity  metal market volatility  and cost structure 
concerning ford and general motors  federal financial assistance to automotive manufacturers cannot be assured and pressures for the restructuring or combination among manufacturers may increase  with potentially negative impacts on the company 
the company s current financial resources are believed to be adequate at the time  with available cash and short term investments totaling about million at the end of and no substantial debt repayments due until the company has not been able to secure a credit agreement upon terms deemed reasonable 
the looming expiration of the major automotive contracts creates significant exposure 
if pgm prices in remained at their year end levels  the loss of contractual floor price support at that point would make the company s mining operations  at least as currently configured  unsustainable without other support 
obviously  to the degree the 
table of contents company can improve the efficiency and productivity of its mining operations  its competitiveness at low pgm prices is correspondingly improved 
likewise  efforts to develop new applications for pgms and to open new markets for them should strengthen demand and hopefully result in higher metals prices longer term 
continued efforts to diversify the company  both internally and externally  will decrease the company s dependence on the price of just one or two commodities for financial viability 
management continues to focus on all of these objectives in preparing for a post auto contract environment  although the level of resources applied to these efforts has of necessity been cut back in in the regulatory arena  the company made progress on several fronts during safety performance at all locations has continued to strengthen 
overall  the company s rate of medically reportable incidents improved between and areas of specific focus from a safety perspective include enhanced work place examinations  safety standards implementation and compliance  accident incident investigations  near miss reporting and use of loss control representatives who are part of the mining workforce 
employee led focus teams have been successful in addressing many safety related challenges 
new rules with respect to diesel particulate matter dpm concentrations underground took effect in may the new rules are at the cutting edge of what is achievable with available technology  but the company has had good success in reducing dpms through a balanced program including catalytic converters bio diesel blending  equipment reductions  engine and exhaust system modifications and employee awareness training 
msha continues to support the company s implementation efforts and granted the company a special one year extension for certain areas of its stillwater mine 
this special extension expired on november  the company has applied for an additional extension and while the additional extension has not been granted to date  the company has no indications that an additional extension will be denied for its stillwater mine 
the east boulder mine has obtained a one year extension applicable to certain areas of the mine for a period of one year commencing on may   subject to specified conditions being met during the period of the special extension 
the company continues to comply with the conditions outlined in the special extension granted may  msha has the statutory authority to issue citations for non compliance and  in situations where it determines the health and safety of miners is at significant risk  to order cessation of mining operations until the risk is alleviated 
no assurance can be given that any lack of compliance will not impact the company 
the company s environmental performance continued its excellent track record during environmental compliance is a very high priority in view of the pristine area in which the company operates 
the company has a record of open communication and cooperative  proactive involvement with local and regional environmental groups 
the company s ground breaking good neighbor agreement with these groups provides a vehicle for facilitating such communication and addressing issues cooperatively 
the company agreed to increase surety bond coverage of its long term obligations for final reclamation during regulatory authorities have not yet completed their updated environmental impact study eis  which ultimately will determine the appropriate level of such bonding  but in the interim the parties all recognized that the appropriate level will be higher than in the past 
as the economy weakened late in  the company agreed to increase bonding by an additional million to alleviate concerns aired by the agencies involved and to allow time for the eis to be completed 
the shortage of skilled manpower that has challenged the company over the past several years has been mitigated somewhat by the economic shift during the second half of as already noted  the restructuring at east boulder mine provided an opportunity to transfer miners over to the stillwater mine  largely alleviating the shortages there and allowing the company to replace higher cost contractors with its own employees 
in addition  as commodity prices have declined  various mining operations in north america have cut back or closed down  freeing up manpower 
however  this shift in the labor market appears to be driven mostly by low metal prices and a weak economy  and there is no assurance that the same shortages would not quickly reappear when commodity prices recover 
consequently  the company is continuing its new miner training program at the stillwater mine on a limited scale 
looking forward  management believes that the company s mine production for will be  pgm ounces  generally in the same range as total cash costs per ounce a non gaap measure of extraction efficiency for the year are projected at  again in the same range as the per ounce in capital expenditures will decline sharply to about million in  down from about million in at the stillwater mine  lower development activity in should still be sufficient to maintain the current developed state  but will eliminate additional spending to expand the developed state that has been included for the past several years 
at east boulder mine  development has been pared back further  providing only the additional development needed to support production 

table of contents although these targets assume a continuation of low pgm prices  management has focused its planning on the assumption that pgm market prices will strengthen longer term 
investment interest in pgms may cause pricing to strengthen somewhat even in  but there can be no substantive recovery in pgm pricing until the economy strengthens sufficiently to free up the flow of credit so that automotive markets recover 
automotive and related demand for platinum and palladium comprises about of the market demand for these metals  so recovery of automotive demand is critical to supply demand balance for pgms 
third party analysts have estimated that about of pgm production is uneconomic at year end market prices  driving some production curtailments  however  to date the decline in production has not been sufficient to offset the loss of demand 
once the automotive industry begins showing signs of recovery  however  pgm pricing should react favorably 
substantial research effort over the past several years has gone into opportunities to substitute palladium in applications that currently use platinum and rhodium 
this substitution should benefit palladium  the company s principal product 
taken together with increasingly stringent emission control regulations worldwide and continuing growth in vehicle demand in the developing world  along with growing emphasis on recycling  management is reasonably optimistic toward the longer term future of these businesses 
this future is not without risks  however  and should the present economic downturn worsen substantially or extend for several years  the company s viability could be severely challenged particularly after the automotive contracts expire 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues in view of the higher prices realized for the company s by product sales in the past several years  the company has modified its reporting for by products to include sales proceeds from by products within its sales revenues from mining 
previously  these proceeds were netted against costs of revenues 
the discussion that follows adjusts and results to reflect this reporting change 
the company s total revenues  including proceeds from the sale of by products  totaled million in  compared to million in  a increase 
this increase was net of hedging losses on forward sales of platinum of million on  ounces hedged in  and million on  ounces hedged in the increase in total revenues reflects substantially higher average realized prices  particularly in the first six months of  which more than offset lower mine production sales volumes in revenues from mine production were million in including million from by products  compared to million in of which million was from by products  an increase 
the increase was attributable to the higher realized market prices in early which more than made up for the lower volume of mined ounces sold in platinum and palladium ounces sold from mine production were  in  compared to  ounces in the average realization on these platinum and palladium sales including the effects of hedging and of floor and ceiling prices in the underlying contracts was per ounce in and per ounce in reduced by product revenues were generally due to lower sales in  particularly for rhodium and nickel 
revenues from pgm recycling grew during  increasing to million in  from million in recycled ounces sold  excluding tolled material  increased in to  ounces compared to  ounces in and the company s combined average realization on recycling sales which include palladium  platinum and rhodium increased to  per ounce in from  per ounce in the company processed increased volumes of recycled materials on a tolling basis in the company toll processed  ounces of pgms during  up from  tolled ounces in total recycling volume increased to  ounces of pgms in up from  ounces in the company recognized other revenue of million and million for metal purchased in the open market and resold in and  respectively 

table of contents costs of metals sold costs of metals sold  which excludes depreciation expense and no longer includes credits for by products  was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
even though the volume of purchased recycling material increased from year to year  significantly higher pgm prices drove up the acquisition cost of the material  which largely accounted for an increase in recycling costs of metals sold to million in from million in the average acquisition cost of metal in the company s recycling segment including platinum  palladium and rhodium increased to  per ounce in from  per ounce in  reflecting much higher average prices for pgms  particularly for platinum and rhodium 
during  the company s mining operations produced  ounces of pgms  including  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
this represents about a decrease from  during which the company s mining operations produced  ounces of pgms  including  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
the stillwater mine produced  ounces of pgms in  compared with  ounces of pgms in  a decrease 
the east boulder mine produced  ounces of pgms in  compared with  ounces of pgms in  a year on year decrease 
the lower production in reflected the restructuring at east boulder mine and somewhat lower ore grades associated with the specific mining areas in at stillwater mine 
the costs of metals sold from mine production  despite lower production  increased to million in  compared to million in the prior year  a increase 
the company s mining costs increased during mostly as a result of higher commodity prices for materials consumed in mining 
the cost of metals sold on palladium purchases for resale was million in  compared to million in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  compared to million in although amortization rates per ton mined were generally higher in than in  the lower tonnage produced in more than offset the effect of the higher tonnage rates 
exploration the company participated in several early stage exploration programs during and  spending million and million to meet commitments under these programs during and  respectively 
in addition  the company expended million in and million in toward equity investments in exploration companies 
during  the company also wrote down a portion of its equity investments in these ventures to fair value  taking charges totaling nearly million 
marketing the company continued its market development efforts for palladium during  largely in support of the palladium alliance international  spending million on marketing  up slightly from million in general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in  compared to million in  an increase  reflecting higher payroll and contractor costs 
in addition to these costs  the company separately incurred about million in restructuring costs during  mostly associated with employee and contract terminations and re location of the billings corporate office 
interest income and expense interest income decreased to million in from million in  on the result of lower recycling balances in the last quarter of the company s balance of cash and related liquid assets earning interest increased to million at december   from million reported at december  this increase was partially attributable to decreases in working capital in the company s recycling segment that resulted from lower pgm prices and lower inventories later in the year 
inventories and advances associated with recycling decreased to million at year end from million at the end of the company outstanding long term debt balance was million at december   up from million at december  the company replaced its debt facilities during  increasing the level of borrowings by about million 
the added borrowings helped the company accommodate significant growth in its recycling segment during the first nine months of interest expense declined to million in  from million in as the increased debt balances partially offset the benefit of much lower interest rates 
the expense included million of unamortized financing costs that were written off in conjunction with the company s refinancing 
total income tax provision the company recorded a small tax benefit of  in related to a refundable minimum tax credit and only a de minimis income tax expense in  reflecting certain state minimum taxes paid 
changes in the company s net deferred tax assets have been offset by the change in the related valuation allowance  as the company does not project any opportunity to benefit from its tax loss carry forwards 
other comprehensive income loss  net of tax the company recorded a gain in other comprehensive income of million in compared to a gain of million in the gain included million of realized hedging losses reclassified to income  partially offset by million representing the change in fair value of derivatives 
table of contents held  and million of unrealized losses on investments 
the gain included million of realized hedging losses reclassified to income  partially offset by million representing the change in fair value of derivatives held  and of unrealized gains on investments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues were million  including proceeds from the sale of by products  in  compared to million in  a increase 
this increase was attributable to substantially higher market prices for platinum group metals  more than offsetting lower mine production and slightly lower recycling sales volumes 
reported revenues in both periods include the effect of floor and ceiling prices in the automotive sales agreements and of realized losses on platinum hedges 
revenues from mine production  including by product sales  were million in  compared to million in  a decrease 
the slight decrease was attributable to the lower volume of mined ounces produced in  largely offset by higher realized pgm prices 
ounces of platinum and palladium sold from mine production were  in  compared to  ounces in the average realization on these sales including the effects of hedging and of floor and ceiling prices in the underlying contracts was per ounce in and per ounce in revenues from pgm recycling grew during  increasing to million in  from million in recycled ounces sold  excluding tolled material  declined slightly in to  ounces compared to  ounces in  however  the company s combined average realization on recycling sales which include palladium  platinum and rhodium increased to  per ounce in from  per ounce in the company processed increased volumes of recycled materials on a tolling basis in the company toll processed  ounces of pgms during  up from  tolled ounces in total recycling volume increased to  ounces of pgms in up from  ounces in revenues from sales of purchased pgms  including sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  declined to million in from million in within these totals  sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction generated million in revenues during on sales of  ounces of palladium from inventory at an average realization of per ounce 
these sales ended in the first quarter of when this palladium inventory was exhausted 
excluding the sales from the norilsk nickel transaction  the company purchased and resold nearly  ounces of palladium during and  ounces of platinum  palladium and rhodium during one of the sales contracts associated with the norilsk nickel metal also required the company to provide  ounces of platinum and  ounces of rhodium per month either purchased on the open market or produced from mining operations or sourced in the recycling segment 
in  the company recognized other miscellaneous revenue of million for metal purchased in the open market and resold under these sales contracts  which terminated in the first quarter of costs of metals sold cost of metals sold  which excludes depreciation expense and no longer includes by product credits  was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
although the volume of purchased recycling material was relatively flat from year to year  higher pgm prices drove up the acquisition cost of the material  which largely accounted for an increase in recycling costs of metals sold to million in from million in the average acquisition cost of metal in the company s recycling segment including platinum  palladium and rhodium increased to  per ounce in from per ounce in  reflecting much higher average prices for pgms  and particularly for platinum and rhodium 
during  the company s mining operations produced  ounces of pgms  including  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
this represents about a decrease from  during which the company s mining operations produced  ounces of pgms  including  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
high employee attrition rates associated with a change in shift schedule and a brief labor strike at stillwater mine  coupled with lower average productivity from less experienced miners  largely drove the lower production in in response  the company also modestly reduced its emphasis on primary mine development during  allowing some resources previously dedicated to primary development to be redeployed into production 
the stillwater mine produced  ounces of pgms in  compared with  ounces of pgms in  a decrease 
the east boulder mine produced  ounces of pgms in  compared with  ounces of 
table of contents pgms in  a year on year decrease 
these production decreases  again  were attributable to workforce issues  partially offset by the redeployment of development resources into production 
the costs of metals sold from mine production  despite lower production  increased to million in  compared to million in the prior year  a increase 
the increased mining costs primarily reflect year on year inflation in wages and prices 
the costs of metals sold from other activities which in included sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and some associated sales was million in  compared to million in the two year program to sell the palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction ended during the first quarter of the total cost in attributable to palladium sold from the ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction was million on the sale of  ounces at an average cost per ounce of just over the remaining cost of metal sold in represents mostly the cost of sourcing platinum and rhodium to meet related contractual commitments 
as discussed in revenues above  the company entered into sales contracts in  which required it to source metal from third parties in order to fulfill delivery commitments to customers 
the cost of metals sold from activities under these contracts  excluding sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  was million in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  compared to million in  a decrease 
although amortization rates per ton mined were higher in than in  the lower tonnage produced in more than offset the effect of the higher tonnage rates 
exploration the company participated in several early stage exploration programs during and  spending about million and million on these programs during and  respectively 
in addition  the company expended million and million in and  respectively  toward equity investments in exploration companies 
marketing the company expanded its market development efforts for palladium during  largely in support of the palladium alliance international  spending million on marketing  up from million in general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in  compared to million in  a decrease 
normal year on year increases in these costs were largely offset by benefit forfeitures and share based compensation adjustments 
interest income and expense interest income increased to million in from million in  reflecting increased interest on recycling volumes 
the company s balance of cash and related liquid assets earning interest decreased to million at december   from million reported at december  this decrease was partially attributable to growth in working capital in the company s recycling segment 
inventories and advances associated with recycling increased to million at year end from million at the end of the company has reduced its debt to million at december  from million at december  interest expense declined very slightly to million in from million in on the reduced debt balances 
total income tax provision the company recorded only de minimis income tax expense in and  reflecting certain state minimum taxes paid 
changes in the company s net deferred tax assets have been offset by the change in the related valuation allowance 
other comprehensive income loss  net of tax the company recorded a gain in other comprehensive income of million in compared to a gain of million in the gain included million of realized hedging losses reclassified to income  partially offset by million representing the change in fair value of derivatives held  and million of unrealized gains on investments 
the gain included million of realized hedging losses reclassified to income  partially offset by million representing the change in fair value of derivatives held  and  of unrealized loss on investments 
liquidity and capital resources for  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to and million for and  respectively 
the company s net cash flow from operating activities is affected by several key factors  including net realized prices for its products  cash costs of production  and the level of pgm production from the mines 

table of contents liquidation of about million cash tied up in recycling working capital accounted for a portion of the cash flow from operations  offset in part by about a million increase in restricted cash associated with added surety bonding 
the million reported loss for included about million of non cash charges  including million carrying value adjustment at the east boulder mine  a million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment  a million write down of trade receivables  a million write down of advances on inventory purchases  a million charge to mark long term investments to current market  and million of depreciation and amortization 
at the pgm price levels prevailing at december   absent separate hedging arrangements  a change in the price of platinum generally would flow through almost dollar for dollar to cash flow from operations  subject only to price ceilings on of the mines platinum production to be sold under the company s long term sales contracts  and certain costs severance taxes and royalties on mine production which adjust upward or downward with market prices 
under the company s long term sales contracts for mined production  a change in the market price of palladium  at prices above about per ounce  would flow through directly to cash flow from operations  subject only to an offset for severance taxes and royalties that are based on the realized price 
at market prices for palladium below about per ounce  floor prices take affect that support the palladium price at or near that level on most of the mined palladium sales 
considering the palladium price prevailing at december   if the company did not have the benefit of the floors and ceilings in the automobile contracts  the company would have expected to realize about per ounce on sales of palladium at market price  which would represent a reduction in annual sales revenue of about million 
the company enters into fixed forward contracts that set the selling price of a significant portion of pgms in its recycling activities  so for outstanding recycling lots  a change in the market price of platinum and palladium on sales of recycling materials would have little or no effect on margins earned from this activity and on cash flow from operations 
however  a percentage change in market prices would affect margins on future lots by about the same percentage as the change in price 
it normally takes existing lots of recycling material two to three months from the date of receipt to flow through to sales 
changes in the cash costs of production generally flow through dollar for dollar into cash flow from operations 
a reduction due to grade in total mine production of  or about  ounces per year  would reduce cash flow from operations by an estimated million per year at the price and cost levels prevailing at december  because the company at these pgm price levels is working to remain cash neutral  such a reduction could require additional operating changes and perhaps a suspension of operations at the east boulder mine 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities primarily represent capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and changes in highly liquid investments 
see note property  plant and equipment to the company s audited financial statements for further information 
the company also expended million and million and million to acquire equity interests in two small exploration companies during  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to net cash used by financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities included proceeds of million in convertible debentures  offset by the repayment of the company s outstanding balance under its previous bank credit facility of million 
debt issuance costs and changes in restricted cash accounted for the remainder of the net cash provided financing activities 
at december   the company s available cash was million and it had million of debt outstanding 
if highly liquid short term investments are included  the company s balance sheet liquidity increases to million 
during  the company will be required to make a payment of approximately million for scheduled principal reductions on its outstanding borrowings  reflecting the final maturity of the company s educational impact bonds 
the company  at interest rate levels prevailing at december   also will be required to pay approximately million in total interest payments during related to its outstanding debt obligations 
the company s current liquidity is reasonable under the circumstances and largely results from the completion of the sale of convertible debentures in march in view of the worldwide credit crisis  the company has not been successful in putting in place a new credit agreement 
while the lack of a credit agreement may create vulnerability for the company  the company believes that its liquidity is sufficient for its needs at this time 

table of contents convertible debentures on march   the company issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due debentures 
the debentures pay interest at per annum  payable semi annually on march and september of each year  commencing september  the debentures will mature on march   subject to earlier repurchase or conversion 
each  principal amount of debentures is initially convertible  at the option of the holders  into approximately shares of the company s common stock  at any time prior to the maturity date 
the conversion rate is subject to certain adjustments  but will not be adjusted for accrued interest or any unpaid interest 
the conversion rate initially represents a conversion price of per share 
holders of the debentures may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain events including a change in control 
the company may redeem the debentures for cash beginning on or after march  the debentures were sold to an accredited investor within the meaning of rule under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  in reliance upon the private placement exemption afforded by section of the securities act 
the initial investor offered and resold the debentures to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act 
an affiliate of mmc norilsk nickel  with the approval of the company s public directors  purchased million of the debentures  thereby maintaining its majority ownership position in the company 
in connection with the issuance of the debentures  the company agreed to file a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec for the resale of the debentures and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures and to use reasonable best efforts to cause it to become effective  within an agreed upon period 
the company also agreed to periodically update the shelf registration and to keep it effective until the earlier of the date the debentures or the common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures is eligible to be sold to the public pursuant to rule of the securities act or the date on which there are no outstanding registrable securities 
except for the debentures held by company affiliates  the six month holding period prescribed in rule has now elapsed  and management believes the debentures are now eligible to be sold to the public in the secondary market 
management has evaluated the terms of the debentures  which include the call feature  redemption feature  and the conversion feature  under applicable accounting literature  including sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  and concluded that none of these features should be separately accounted for as derivatives 
in connection with the issuance of the debentures  the company incurred million of issuance costs  which primarily consisted of investment banking fees  legal and other professional fees 
these costs are classified within other noncurrent assets and are being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term from issuance through the first date that the holders can require repurchase of the debentures  which is march  amortization expense related to the issuance costs of the debentures was million for the year  and the interest expense on the debentures was million for the year the company made cash payments of million for interest on the debentures during the company used a portion of the proceeds of the debenture offering to retire million of term debt and terminate a million revolving credit line under its previous credit facility 
interest expense for includes approximately million of amortization expense and million for the non cash write off of unamortized issuance costs on the prior facility 
in conjunction with terminating the revolving credit line  the company posted million of restricted cash during to collateralize stand by letters of credit previously supported by that facility

critical accounting policies mine development expenditures capitalization and amortization mining operations are inherently capital intensive  generally requiring substantial capital investment for the initial and concurrent development and infrastructure of the mine 
many of these expenditures are necessarily incurred well in advance of actual extraction of ore 
underground mining operations such as those conducted by the company require driving tunnels and sinking shafts that provide access to the underground ore body and construction and development of infrastructure  including electrical and ventilation systems  rail and other forms of transportation  shop facilities  material handling areas and hoisting systems 
ore mining and removal operations require significant underground facilities used to conduct mining operations and to transport the ore out of the mine to processing facilities located above ground 
contemporaneously with mining  additional development is undertaken to provide access to ongoing extensions of the ore body  allowing more ore to be produced 
in addition to the development costs that have been previously incurred  these ongoing development expenditures are necessary to access and support all future mining activities 
mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new ore bodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized 
mine development expenditures consist of vertical shafts  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps  rail 
table of contents and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
many such facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific ore reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate is based upon un amortized capitalized mine development costs  and the related ore reserves 
capital development expenditures are added to the un amortized capitalized mine development costs as the related assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 
the company s method of accounting for development costs is as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine are treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all ongoing development costs of footwall laterals  ramps and associated facilities are amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development 
the calculation of the amortization rate  and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations  could be materially affected to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable ore reserves 
this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining ore reserves 
these factors could include an expansion of proven and probable ore reserves through development activities  differences between estimated and actual costs of mining due to differences in grade or metal recovery rates  and differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of ore reserves 
asset impairment the company follows statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices long term sales contract prices and historical pricing trends or third party projections of future prices rather than prices at a point in time as an indicator of longer term future prices  production levels  and capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
if the assets are impaired  a calculation of fair market value is performed  and if fair market value is lower than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are reduced to their fair market value 
in accordance with the methodology prescribed by sfas no 
 the company concluded that the economic circumstances in which the company operates have changed significantly during the latter part of this required the company to assess whether total estimated future cash flows at the east boulder and the stillwater mines would be sufficient to recoup the carrying amount of each asset 
based on current mine plans and an assessment of long term pricing  the company determined that undiscounted future cash flows at the stillwater mine are sufficient to return the carrying value  but the undiscounted future cash flows projected at east boulder mine are not sufficient to cover the carrying value there 
consequently  with the assistance of behre dolbear  the company assessed the fair value of the east 
table of contents boulder mine assets and concluded that a valuation adjustment was needed at east boulder 
accordingly  the company s reported earnings at december   include a million reduction in carrying value of the east boulder mine assets to million 
income taxes income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax rates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
each quarter  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance has been provided at december   and december   for the portion of the company s net deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
based on the company s current financial projections  and in view of the level of tax depreciation and depletion deductions available  it appears unlikely that the company will owe any income taxes for the foreseeable future 
however  if average realized pgm prices were to increase substantially in the future  the company could owe income taxes prospectively on the resulting higher taxable income 
post closure reclamation costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  the company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation ultimately is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss at the time of settlement 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates for each mining operation of the future costs the company will incur to complete final reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work that the company is required to perform 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 
the company reviewed its asset retirement assumptions at december   and recorded a reduction of million and million for the stillwater mine and the east boulder mine  respectively  due to an increase in the estimated mine lives of both mines 
see note asset retirement obligation to the company s audited financial statements for further information 
derivative instruments from time to time  the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards to manage the effect of changes in the prices of palladium and platinum on the company s revenue 
the company accounts for its derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be highly effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the company primarily uses derivatives to hedge metal prices and to manage interest rate risk 
the company also enters into financially settled forwards related to its recycling segment which are not 
table of contents accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
see note derivative instruments to the company s audited financial statements for further information 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in metal prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells palladium  platinum and associated by product metals directly to its customers and also through third parties 
as a result  financial performance can be materially affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
in order to manage commodity price risk and to reduce the impact of fluctuation in prices  the company enters into long term contracts and from time to time uses various derivative financial instruments 
because the company hedges only with instruments that have a high correlation with the value of the hedged transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged transaction 
the company has entered into long term sales contracts with ford motor company and general motors corporation 
the contracts together cover significant portions of the company s mined pgm production through december and stipulate floor and ceiling prices for some of the covered production 
the company from time to time also purchases platinum and rhodium in the open market for resale under various supply arrangements 
see business and properties current operations pgm sales and hedging activities and note derivative instruments to the company s audited financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company s open positions 
beginning in the third quarter of  the major us bond rating agencies have successively downgraded the corporate ratings of ford motor company and general motors corporation  the company s two primary customers under long term sales contracts 
as a result  the debt of these companies no longer qualifies as investment grade 
the company s business is substantially dependent on its contracts with ford and general motors  particularly because the floor prices in these contracts provide significant price protection to the company in periods of low palladium prices 
under applicable law  these contracts may be void or voidable if ford or general motors becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy 
the loss of either of these contracts could require the company to sell at prevailing market prices  which at price levels prevailing at december   would expose it to lower metal prices as compared to the floor prices under the contracts 
in such an event  the company s operating plans could be threatened 
thus  termination of these contracts could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and viability 
federal financial assistance to automotive manufacturers cannot be assured and pressures for the restructuring or combination among manufacturers may increase  with potentially negative impacts on the company 
the company from time to time enters into fixed forward sales and financially settled forward sales transactions that may or may not be accounted for as cash flow hedges to mitigate the price risk in its pgm recycling and mine production activities 
in the fixed forward transactions  normally metals contained in the spent catalytic materials are sold forward at the time the materials are purchased and are delivered against the fixed forward contracts when the finished ounces are recovered 
the company accounted for such fixed forwards as cash flow hedges for transactions entered into prior to april   thereafter  the company has elected to account for these transactions using the normal purchase and normal sales provisions contained in sfas no 
financially settled forwards also may be used as a mechanism to offset fluctuations in metal prices associated with future production in circumstances where the company elects to retain control of the final disposition of the metal 
in the past  the company generally accounted for financial settled forward transactions as cash flow hedges 
following the amendment of one of the automotive pgm supply contracts in august of  the company has from time to time entered into various financially settled forward contracts covering a portion of its recycling production and has elected not to apply hedge accounting treatment to these transactions 
consequently  these transactions are marked to market in each accounting period 
under financially settled forwards  at each settlement date  the company receives the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is below the forward price  and the company pays the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is above the forward price 
the company s financially settled forwards are settled at maturity 
as of december   the company was not party to any financially settled forward agreements 

table of contents the company also enters into financially settled forwards related to its recycling segment which are not accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
all commodity instruments outstanding at december   are expected to be settled within the next six months
