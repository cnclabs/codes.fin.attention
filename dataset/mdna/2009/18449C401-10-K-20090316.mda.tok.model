table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design products and license environmentally proven technologies and solutions for the global emission reduction market based upon our portfolio of patents and extensive library of performance data and know how 
we believe our core competence is the innovation  application  development and marketing of technological products and solutions to enable emission control 
our suite of technologies offers a broad range of market ready solutions to reduce emissions while saving costs through fuel economy improvement and reduction of engine wear 
we believe that clean air  energy efficiency and sustainability continue to attract increasing attention around the world  as does the need to develop alternative energy sources 
increasingly  combustion engine development is influenced by concern over global warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and toxic exhaust emissions 
because carbon dioxide results from the combustion of fossil fuels  reducing fuel consumption is often cited as the primary way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
further  because diesel engines are or more fuel efficient than gasoline engines  the increased use of diesel engines relative to gasoline engines is one way to reduce overall fuel consumption  and thereby  significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
we believe the diesel engine is and will remain a strategic and economic source of motive power 
however  diesel engines emit higher levels of two toxic pollutants particulate matter and nitrogen oxides than gasoline engines fitted with catalytic converters 
both of these pollutants affect human health and damage the environment 
these factors  among others  have led to legislation and standards that may drive demand for our products and solutions 
our operating revenue consists of product sales  technology licensing fees and royalties  and consulting and other primarily  engineering and development consulting services 
the following table sets forth the percentage contribution of our revenue sources in relation to total revenue for the years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  product sales license and royalty revenue consulting and other total the mix of our revenue sources during any reporting period may have a material impact on our operating results 
in particular  our execution of technology licensing agreements  and the timing of the revenue recognized from these agreements  has not been predictable 
product sales include our patented platinum plus fuel borne catalyst products and concentrate and hardware primarily  our patented aris advanced reagent injector and dosing systems for selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides  our platinum plus purifier systems and catalyzed wire mesh filters 
our platinum plus fuel borne catalyst is registered with the us environmental protection agency epa and other environmental authorities around the world 
our products are sold to distributors  resellers  various transportation segments  including on road  off road  rail and marine  among other end users  through our distribution network and direct sales 
we license our aris nitrogen oxides selective catalytic reduction scr system and the combination of exhaust gas recirculation egr with scr to others  generally with an up front fee for the technology and know how and an on going royalty per unit 
we also sell finished aris based scr systems to potential aris licensees and end users 
we are actively seeking additional licensees for both mobile and stationary applications 
we offer rights to our catalyzed wire mesh technology through license agreements as well as selling finished filters for use with our platinum plus fuel borne catalyst 
since inception  we have devoted efforts to the research and development of technologies and products in various areas  including platinum fuel borne catalysts for emission reduction and fuel economy improvement and nitrogen oxides reduction systems to control emissions from diesel engines 
although we believe we have made progress in commercializing our technologies  we have experienced recurring losses from our operations 
our accumulated deficit amounted to approximately million as of december  the internally generated funds from our revenue sources have not been sufficient to cover our operating costs 
the ability of our revenue sources  especially product sales and technology license fees and royalties  to generate significant cash for our operations is critical to our long term success 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in obtaining market acceptance of our products or technologies or in completing our current licensing agreement negotiations 
to the extent our internally generated funds are inadequate  we believe that we will need to obtain additional working capital through equity financings 
however  we can give no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based upon assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes that of our significant accounting policies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when earned 
for technology licensing fees paid by licensees that are fixed and determinable  accepted by the customer and nonrefundable  revenue is recognized upon execution of the license agreement  unless it is subject to completion of any performance criteria specified within the agreement  in which case it is deferred until such performance criteria are met 
royalties are frequently required pursuant to license agreements or may be the subject of separately executed royalty agreements 
revenue from royalties is recognized ratably over the royalty period based upon periodic reports submitted by the royalty obligor or based on minimum royalty requirements 
revenue from product sales is recognized when title has passed and our products are shipped to our customer  unless the purchase order or contract specifically requires us to provide installation for hardware purchases 
for hardware projects in which we are responsible for installation either directly or indirectly by third party contractors  revenue is recognized when the hardware is installed and or accepted  if the project requires inspection and or acceptance 
other revenue primarily consists of engineering and development consulting services 
revenue from technical consulting services is generally recognized and billed as the services are performed 
generally  our license agreements are non exclusive and specify the geographic territories and classes of diesel engines covered  such as on road vehicles  off road vehicles  construction  stationary engines  marine and railroad engines 
at the time of the execution of our license agreement  we convey the right to the licensee to use our patented technologies 
the up front fees are not subject to refund or adjustment 
we recognize the license fee as revenue at the inception of the license agreement when we have reasonable assurance that the technologies transferred have been accepted by the licensee and collectability of the license fee is reasonably assured 
the nonrefundable up front fee is in exchange for the culmination of the earnings process as the company has accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenue 
under our license agreements  there is no significant obligation for future performance required of the company 
each licensee must determine if the rights to our patented technologies are usable for their business purposes and must determine the means of use without further involvement by the company 
in most cases  licensees must make additional investments to enable the capabilities of our patents  including significant engineering  sourcing of and assembly of multiple components 
our obligation to defend valid patents does not represent an additional deliverable to which a portion of an arrangement fee should be allocated 
defending the patents is generally consistent with our representation in the license agreement that such patents are legal and valid 

table of contents research and development costs costs relating to the research  development and testing of our technologies and products are charged to operations as they are incurred 
these costs include verification programs  evaluation and testing projects  salary and benefits  consulting fees  materials and testing gear 
our research and development expenses totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
patents and patent expense patents  which include all direct incremental costs associated with initial patent filings and costs to acquire rights to patents under licenses  are stated at cost and amortized using the straight line method over the remaining useful lives  ranging from one to twenty years 
indirect and other patent related costs are expensed as incurred 
patent amortization expense for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
we evaluate the remaining useful life of our patents each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
if the evaluation determines that the patent s remaining useful life has changed  the remaining carrying amount of the patent is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
we also evaluate our patents for impairment whenever events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the testing for impairment includes evaluating the undiscounted cash flows of the asset and the remaining period of amortization or useful life 
the factors used in evaluating the undiscounted cash flows include current operating results  projected future operating results and cash flows and any other material factors that may affect the continuity or the usefulness of the asset 
if impairment exists or if we decide to abandon a patent  the patent is written down to its fair value based upon discounted cash flows 
at december  and  the company s patents  net were  and  respectively 
newly adopted accounting standards effective january   we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
specifically  sfas no 
sets forth a definition of fair value  and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques  giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the provisions of sfas no 
are generally required to be applied on a prospective basis  except to certain financial instruments accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  for which the provisions of sfas no 
should be applied retrospectively 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp clarified the application of fas fsp demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
fsp was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the guidance provided by fsp is consistent with our approach to valuing our auction rate securities for which there is no active market 
in the first quarter of  we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits an entity to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many financial assets and liabilities 
entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings 
entities electing the fair value option are required to distinguish  on the face of the statement of financial position  the fair value of assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and similar assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute 
the adjustment to reflect the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of initial adoption 
sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as the company did not have any such financial assets and liabilities as of january  
table of contents recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r provides revised guidance on how acquirers recognize and measure the consideration transferred  identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
establishes requirements for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company sometimes called minority interests be clearly identified  presented  and disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
all changes in the parent s ownership interests are required to be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in deconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially at fair value 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued staff position fsp 
fsp permits delayed adoption of sfas for certain non financial assets and liabilities  which are not recognized at fair value on a recurring basis  until fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  as permitted by fsp  the company has elected to delay the adoption of sfas for qualifying non financial assets and liabilities  such as fixed assets and patents 
the company does not expect the adoption of fsp to have a material impact on the on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
these enhanced disclosures will discuss a how and why a company uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb statement no

fsp fas no 
amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intent of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 
revised  business combinations  and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
fsp fas no 
is effective for the company for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect this standard to have any material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued eitf  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf provides guidance on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock for the purpose of evaluating the first criteria of the scope exception in paragraph a of sfas no 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and early application is not permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows

we expect to continue to invest in our patents 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and is attributable primarily to proceeds from borrowing from a demand loan facility 
we are using the proceeds from short term debt for general working capital purposes 
at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively  an increase of million 
our working capital was million at december  compared to million at december   a decrease of million primarily attributable to the million decrease in accounts receivable  net

at december  and  we held approximately million million par value and million million par value  respectively  in investments in ars collateralized by student loans  primarily aaa aaa rated  which are substantially guaranteed by the us department of education 
we sold million of these investments in however  starting on february  and continuing to date in  the company experienced difficulty in effecting additional sales of such securities because of the failure of the auction mechanism as a result of sell orders exceeding buy orders 
liquidity for these ars is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals 
these failed auctions represent liquidity risk exposure and are not defaults or credit events 
holders of the securities continue to receive interest on the investments  and the securities continue to be auctioned at the pre determined intervals typically every days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 

table of contents in may  we arranged a million demand loan facility using our ars as collateral and in july  borrowed those funds as a matter of financial prudence to secure available cash see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  ubs approved a million credit facility 
the ars serve as collateral for the loan which is due upon demand see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in october  the company received an offer the offer from ubs for a put right permitting us to sell to ubs at par value all ars previously purchased from ubs at a future date any time during a two year period beginning june  
the offer also included a commitment to loan us of the ubs determined value of the ars at any time until the put is exercised 
the offer was non transferable and expired on november  on november   the company accepted the offer 
the company s right under the offer is in substance a put option with the strike price equal to the par value of the ars which it recorded as an asset  measured at its fair value pursuant to sfas no 
 with the resultant gain recognized in earnings 
at december  and for the period through the date the company accepted the offer  the company classified the ars as available for sale under sfas no 
thereafter  the company transferred the ars to the trading category 
the fair value of the ars was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we sold million of these investments in the fair value declined million from par value in  which loss was charged to operations 
the fair value of the ars was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow approach and market evidence with respect to the ars s collateral  ratings and insurance to assess default risk  credit spread risk and downgrade risk 
the company also recorded the arsr at a fair value of million and recognized the gain in operations  which  together with the million decline in fair value of the ars  resulted in a net charge to operations in of million included in other expense 
the fair value of the arsr was based on an approach in which the present value of all expected future cash flows was subtracted from the current fair market value of the securities and the resultant value was calculated as a future value at an interest rate reflective of counterparty risk 
the company used an independent third party valuation firm to assist it with its determination of fair value of the ars and arsr 
classification of investments as current or non current is dependent upon management s intended holding period  the security s maturity date and liquidity considerations based on market conditions 
at december   the company classified million of the ars as current based on management s intention to use such securities as consideration if ubs demands payment on its loan prior to the date the company exercises the arsr
