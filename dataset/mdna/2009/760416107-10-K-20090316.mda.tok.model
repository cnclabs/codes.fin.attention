item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following is management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
in connection with management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting at december   management identified certain material weaknesses related to other than temporarily impaired investment securities and the financial statement reporting process 
you should see item a of this report and management s report on internal control over financial reporting  for additional information 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 the company has presented the operations of first bank of delaware as discontinued operations starting with the first quarter on january  the first bank of delaware was spun off  effective january  all assets  liabilities and equity of first bank of delaware were spun off as an independent company  trading on the otc market under the stock symbol fbod 
shareholders received one share of stock in first bank of delaware  for every share owned of the company 
the short term loan and tax refund lines of business were accordingly transferred after that date 
republic continued to purchase tax refund anticipation loans from the first bank of delaware through however  first bank of delaware decided not to continue with this program in in reviewing and understanding financial information for the company you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies are described in note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the accounting and financial reporting policies of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those related to the allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of securities and deferred income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the bases for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income through the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
the allowance is maintained at a level that management  based upon its evaluation  considers adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the company s past loan loss experience  the volume and composition of lending conducted by the company  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions and other factors affecting the known and inherent risk in the portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including  among others  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans  exposure at default  value of collateral  and estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios 
all of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance consists of specific allowances for both impaired loans and all classified loans which are not impaired  and a general allowance on the remainder of the portfolio 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
we establish an allowance on certain impaired loans for the amount by which the discounted cash flows  observable market price  or fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  is lower than the carrying value of the loan 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
a delay or shortfall in amount of payments does not necessarily result in the loan being identified as impaired 
we also establish a specific valuation allowance on classified loans which are not impaired 
we segregate these loans by category and assign allowances to each loan based on inherent losses associated with each type of lending and consideration that these loans  in the aggregate  represent an above average credit risk and that more of these loans will prove to be uncollectible compared to loans in the general portfolio 
classification of a loan within this category is based on identified weaknesses that increase the credit risk of the loan 
we establish a general allowance on non classified loans to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular loans 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience  delinquency trends  and management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas  credit quality trends  collateral value  loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  duration of the current business cycle  and bank regulatory examination results 
the applied loss factors are reevaluated each reporting period to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
while management uses the best information known to it in order to make loan loss allowance valuations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  or changes in accounting guidance 
in times of economic slowdown  either regional or national  the risk inherent in the loan portfolio could increase resulting in the need for additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses in future periods 
an increase could also be necessitated by an increase in the size of the loan portfolio or in any of its components even though the credit quality of the overall portfolio may be improving 
historically  our estimates of the allowance for loan loss have approximated actual losses incurred 
in addition  the pennsylvania department of banking and the fdic  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
the pennsylvania department of banking or the fdic may require the recognition of adjustment to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
other than temporary impairment of securities securities are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation  to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
to determine whether a loss in value is other than temporary  management utilizes criteria such as the reasons underlying the decline  the magnitude and duration of the decline and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in the fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
in connection with management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting at december   management identified certain material weaknesses related to other than temporarily impaired investment securities and the financial statement reporting process 
see item a of this report and management s report on internal control over financial reporting  for additional information 
income taxes management makes estimates and judgments to calculate various tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of various deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
management also estimates a reserve for deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
these estimates and judgments are inherently subjective 
historically  our estimates and judgments to calculate our deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  management makes assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
fasb statement no 
does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an asset or liability is carried at fair value 
the new standard provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on exit price and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
the standard also establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the standard eliminates large position discounts for financial instruments quoted in active markets  requires costs related to acquiring financial instruments carried at fair value to be included in earnings as incurred and requires that an issuer s credit standing be considered when measuring liabilities at fair value 
the new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted 
the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations

per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share for the prior year 
there was a million  or  decrease in total interest income  reflecting a decrease in average loans outstanding while interest expense decreased million reflecting a decrease in average interest bearing deposits 
accordingly  net interest income decreased million

return on average assets and average equity of and respectively in compared to and respectively in analysis of net interest income historically  the company s earnings have depended primarily upon republic s net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis  setting forth for the periods i average assets  liabilities  and shareholders equity  ii interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  iii average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates on interest bearing liabilities  and iv republic s net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets 
averages are computed based on daily balances

net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a tax equivalent basis 
net interest income has been increased over the financial statement amount by  and in  and  respectively  to adjust for tax equivalency 
the tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average total interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis of changes in net interest income net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense 
the following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income for the periods indicated

the basis point decrease in the cost of deposits and other borrowings exceeded the basis point decrease in yield on interest bearing assets by basis points 
however  the net interest margin increased by a lesser basis points reflecting a reduction in the amount loan balances which are the highest yielding interest earning assets 
the decrease in yields on assets and rates on deposits and borrowings was due primarily to the repricing of assets and liabilities as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve since september the company s tax equivalent net interest income decreased million  or  to million for  from million for the prior year comparable period 
as shown in the rate volume table above  the decrease in net interest income was due primarily to a decrease in average interest earning assets as well as a larger concentration of higher rate time deposits that offset a decrease in average money market and savings deposits

the company s total tax equivalent interest income decreased million  or  to million for  from million for the prior year comparable period 
interest and fees on loans decreased million  or  to million for  from million for the prior year comparable period

the company s total interest expense decreased million  or  to million for  from million for the prior year comparable period 
interest bearing liabilities averaged million for  versus million for the prior year comparable period  or a decrease of million 
the decrease primarily reflected reduced funding requirements due to a decrease in average interest earning assets 
average deposit balances decreased million while there was an million decrease in average other borrowings 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to for interest expense on time deposit balances decreased million to million in from million in the comparable prior year period  reflecting lower rates  the impact of which more than offset the impact of higher average balances 
money market and savings interest expense decreased million to million in  from million in the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in interest expense on deposits reflected the impact of the lower short term interest rate environment as well as lower average balances 
accordingly  rates on total interest bearing deposits decreased basis points in compared to the comparable prior year period 
interest expense on other borrowings decreased million to million in  reflecting the lower short term interest rate environment and lower average balances 
average other borrowings  primarily overnight fhlb borrowings  decreased million  or  between the respective periods 
rates on overnight borrowings reflected the lower short term interest rate environment as the rate of other borrowings decreased to in  from in the comparable prior year period

results of operations for the years ended december  and overview the company s net income decreased million  or  to million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share for the prior year 
there was a million  or  increase in total interest income  reflecting a increase in average loans outstanding and a increase in average investment securities while interest expense increased million reflecting a increase in average interest bearing deposits outstanding and higher rates as well as a increase in average borrowings outstanding 
accordingly  net interest income decreased million 
contributing to the million decrease in net interest income was the impact of million in net interest income related to tax refund loans in which was not earned in due to the discontinuation of the program 
also there were interest income reductions due to the increase in non performing loans in the provision for loan losses in increased  to million  compared to million in  reflecting the impact of a increase in non accrual loans as well as an increase in reserves on certain loans due to a downturn in the housing market which was offset by  in net tax refund recoveries in versus  in net tax refund charge offs in non interest income decreased  to million in compared to million in non interest expenses increased  to million compared to million in return on average assets and average equity of and respectively in compared to and respectively in net interest income the company s tax equivalent net interest margin decreased basis points to for compared to in excluding the impact of tax refund loans  which were substantially all a first quarter event  the net interest margin was in and in while yields on interest bearing assets decreased basis points to in from in  the yield on total deposits and other borrowings increased basis points to in from in the decrease in yields on assets resulted primarily from the high yield tax refund loans recorded in as well as interest reductions due to the increase in non accrual loans in and rate reductions in the last four months of on variable rate loans as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve 
the increase in yields on deposits was due to the repricing of maturing time deposits at higher rates and increases in rates on money market and savings deposits 
the cost of overnight borrowings decreased slightly as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve but those actions had limited immediate impact in reducing the cost of deposits 
the company s tax equivalent net interest income decreased million  or  to million for from million for as shown in the rate volume table on page  the decrease in net interest income was due primarily to higher rates on deposits and lower rates on loans as discussed in the previous paragraph 
these factors more than offset the impact of the growth in average interest earning assets  primarily loans 
average interest earning assets amounted to million for and million for the million increase resulted from loan growth of million and securities growth of million 
the company s total tax equivalent interest income increased million  or  to million for from million for interest and fees on loans increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase in interest and fees on loans of million resulted from a increase in average loans outstanding less interest reductions due to an increase in non performing loans in and rate reductions on variable rate loans in the last four months of also  million in interest on tax refund loans was realized in interest and dividends on investment securities increased million to million for from million for the increase reflected an increase in average securities outstanding of million  or  to million for from million for interest on federal funds sold and other interest earning assets decreased  or  to  for from million for the decrease reflected a million decrease in average balances to million for from million for the company s total interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million for interest bearing liabilities averaged million for from million for  or an increase of million 
the increase reflected additional funding for loan and securities growth 
average deposit balances increased million while there was a million increase in average other borrowings 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to for from for interest expense on time deposit balances increased million to million for from million for money market and savings interest expense increased million to million for from million for the majority of the increase in interest expense on deposits reflected the higher average deposit balances as well as the higher short term interest rate environment for the first eight months of the basis point decrease in short term interest rates from september through december had minimal effect on deposit rates in accordingly  rates on total interest bearing deposits increased basis points in compared to interest expense on other borrowings increased million to million for from million for  as a result of increased average balances 
average other borrowings  primarily overnight fhlb borrowings  increased million  or  between those respective periods 
increases in balances were utilized to fund loan growth 
rates on other borrowings  primarily due to the basis point decrease in short term interest rates from september through december decreased to for from for interest expense on other borrowings also included the impact of million of average subordinated debentures supporting trust preferred securities 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to maintain the total allowance for loan losses at a level which management determines is adequate to absorb all inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million for compared to million for the provision reflected  for net charge offs of tax refund loans  which were more than offset by million in related net revenues 
the comparable provision reflected  for net recoveries on tax refund loans 
this favorable variance was more than offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses of million for loans transferred to non accrual status in and  for increases in reserves on certain loans due to a downturn in the housing market 
those increases were partially offset by the reversal of reserves on loans which were paid down or otherwise disposed of 
the remaining provisions in both periods also reflected amounts required to increase the allowance for loan growth in accordance with the company s methodology 
non accrual loans increased from million at december  to million at december  non interest income total non interest income decreased  to million for compared to million for  primarily due to a decrease of  related to service fees on deposit accounts 
the decrease in service fees on deposit accounts reflected the termination of services to several large customers 
in addition  other income decreased  primarily due to fee recoveries recorded in loan advisory and servicing fees decreased  which was partially offset by a  increase in bank owned life insurance income and a  increase in gain on sales of other real estate owned 
non interest expenses total non interest expenses increased  or  to million for from million in salaries and employee benefits decreased million  or  to million for from million in that decrease reflected a reduction in bonuses and incentives expense of million

other real estate owned at december   the company had assets classified as other real estate owned with a value of million comprised of plus acres of vacant  unimproved ground with a value of million  a vacant unit motel condominium building with a value of million  a vacant  improved lot zoned for the construction of four townhouses with a value of million and a commercial building with a value of  at december   the company had assets classified as other real estate owned with a value of million comprised of a tract development project for single family homes with a value of million  a commercial building with a value of  and a parcel of land with a value of  bank owned life insurance at december   the value of the insurance was million  an increase of  or  from million at december  the increase reflected income earned on the insurance policies 
other assets other assets increased by million to million at december   from million at december   reflecting million in current income tax assets  the effect of million in short term receivables expected to be collected in first quarter  a  change in the deferred tax asset for unrealized securities losses  a  increase in prepaid expenses related to the issuance of trust preferred securities  a  deferred tax asset for realized securities losses and a  increase in other prepaid expenses 
deposits deposits  which include non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  money market  savings and time deposits including some brokered deposits  are republic s major source of funding 
deposits are generally solicited from the company s market area through the offering of a variety of products to attract and retain customers  with a primary focus on multi product relationships 
total deposits decreased by million to million at december   from million at december  average transaction accounts decreased or million from the prior year end to million in time deposits decreased million  or  to million at december   versus million at the prior year end 
short term borrowings and fhlb advances short term borrowings and fhlb advances are used to supplement deposit generation 
republic had million of term borrowings at december  and at december   respectively 
the million of term borrowings mature june  republic had short term borrowings overnight of million at december  versus million at the prior year end 
subordinated debt subordinated debt amounted to million at december   compared to million at december   as a result of an million issuance of subordinated debentures to support trust preferred securities issued in june the new debentures were issued with an annual rate of and are convertible into the company s common stock at a conversion ratio based on per share of company common stock 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity decreased million to million at december   versus million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of an increase in the unrealized loss on securities 
commitments  contingencies and concentrations the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements 
credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
the maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the company uses the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately million and million and standby letters of credit of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
the million of commitments to extend credit at december   were substantially all variable rate commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  dollars in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years after five years minimum annual rentals or noncancellable operating leases remaining contractual maturities of time deposits subordinated debt employment agreements former ceo serp director and officer retirement plan obligations loan commitments standby letters of credit total as of december   the company had entered into non cancelable lease agreements for its main office and operations center  eleven current republic retail branch facilities  and a new branch facility scheduled to open in  expiring through august   including renewal options 
the leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the minimum rental payments required under these leases are million through the year  including renewal options 
the company has entered into an employment agreement with the ceo of the company 
the aggregate commitment for future salaries and benefits under this employment agreement at december  is approximately  the company has retirement plan agreements with certain directors and officers 
the accrued benefits under the plan at december  was approximately million  with a minimum age of established to qualify for the payments 
at december   the company had no foreign loans and no loan concentrations exceeding of total loans except for credits extended to real estate operators and lessors in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  various types of real estate are included in this category  including industrial  retail shopping centers  office space  residential multi family and others 
in addition  credits extended for real estate agents and managers amounted to million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities are matched 
the company attempts to optimize net interest income while managing period to period fluctuations therein 
the company typically defines interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities as those that reprice within one year or less 
generally  the company limits long term fixed rate assets and liabilities in its efforts to manage interest rate risk 
the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is known as the interest sensitivity gap gap 
a positive gap occurs when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities repricing in the same time periods  and a negative gap occurs when interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets repricing in the same time periods 
a negative gap suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates  and a positive gap suggests the converse 
static gap analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time 
however  it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income  as changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about repricing certain categories of assets and liabilities 
for purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis  assets and liabilities are stated at either their contractual maturity  estimated likely call date  or earliest repricing opportunity 
mortgage backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow  including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends 
savings  money market and interest bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or repricing term and can be withdrawn or repriced at any time 
management estimates the repricing characteristics of these accounts based on historical performance and other deposit behavior assumptions 
these deposits are not considered to reprice simultaneously and  accordingly  a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year 
however  management may choose not to reprice liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates  for competitive or other reasons 
shortcomings  inherent in a simplified and static gap analysis  may result in an institution with a negative gap having interest rate behavior associated with an asset sensitive balance sheet 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating gap in the manner presented in the table on the following page 
the company attempts to manage its assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments 
management uses gap analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income 
management presently believes that the effect on republic of any future fall in interest rates  reflected in lower yielding assets  could be detrimental since republic may not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on its interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  other borrowings and certain transaction accounts 
an increase in interest rates could have a negative effect on republic  due to a possible lag in the repricing of core deposits not assumed in the model 
the following table presents a summary of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap at december  amounts shown in the table include both estimated maturities and instruments scheduled to reprice  including prime based loans 
for purposes of these tables  the company has used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because  statistically  certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date  even without regard to interest rate fluctuations 
additionally  certain prepayment assumptions were made with regard to investment securities based upon the expected prepayment of the underlying collateral of the mortgage backed securities 
the interest rate on a portion of the trust preferred securities is variable and adjusts quarterly

such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental 
in addition to the gap analysis  the company utilizes income simulation modeling in measuring its interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such as yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions 
net portfolio value and net interest income analysis 
our interest rate sensitivity also is monitored by management through the use of models which generate estimates of the change in its net portfolio value npv and net interest income nii over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the following table sets forth our npv as of december  and reflects the changes to npv as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated 
change in npv as of portfolio interest rates net portfolio value value of assets in basis points rate shock amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp bp static in addition to modeling changes in npv  we also analyze potential changes to nii for a twelve month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the following table shows our nii model as of december  change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net interest income change change dollars in thousands bp static the above table indicates that as of december   in the event of an immediate and sustained basis point increase in interest rates  the company s net interest income for the months ending december   subject to the significant limitations specified in the following paragraph  would approximate the static scenario 
however  higher net interest income than shown could result by the effective execution of various deposit pricing and other related strategies 
as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv and nii require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results 
it is unlikely that the increases in net interest income shown in the table would occur  if deposit rates continue to lag prime rate reductions  in falling rate scenarios 
conversely  in rising rate scenarios  competitors deposit rates would be an important determinant for any increases in interest income 
the company s management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the company s estimated net interest income are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
periodically  the company may and does make significant changes to underlying assumptions  which are wholly judgmental 
prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities have increased over historical levels due to the lower interest rate environment  and may result in reductions in margins 
capital resources the company has sponsored three outstanding issues of corporation obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the corporation more commonly known as trust preferred securities 
the subsidiary trusts are not consolidated with the company for financial reporting purposes 
the purpose of the issuances of these securities was to increase capital 
the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to of total tier capital 
in december  republic capital trust ii trust ii issued million of trust preferred securities to investors and million of common securities to the company 
trust ii purchased million of junior subordinated debentures of the company due  and the company used the proceeds to call the securities of republic capital trust i trust i 
the debentures supporting trust ii have a variable interest rate  adjustable quarterly  at over the month libor 
the company may call the securities on any interest payment date after five years 
on june   the company caused republic capital trust iii trust iii  through a pooled offering  to issue million of trust preferred securities to investors and million common securities to the company 
trust iii purchased million of junior subordinated debentures of the company due  which have a variable interest rate  adjustable quarterly  at over the month libor 
the company has the ability to call the securities or any interest payment date after five years  without a prepayment penalty  notwithstanding their final year maturity 
the company caused republic first bancorp capital trust iv trust iv to issuance of million of convertible trust preferred securities in june as part of the company s strategic capital plan 
the securities were purchased by various investors  including vernon w 
hill  ii  founder and chairman retired of commerce bancorp  former director of pennsylvania commerce and  since the investment  a consultant to the company  a family trust of harry d 
madonna  chairman  president and chief executive officer of the company  and theodore j 
flocco  jr  who  since the investment  has been a director of the company 
trust iv also issued million of common securities to the company 
trust iv purchased million of junior subordinated debentures due  which pay interest at an annual rate of and are callable after the fifth year 
the trust preferred securities of trust iv are convertible into approximately million shares of common stock of the company  based on a conversion price of per share of company common stock 
the shareholders equity of the company as of december   totaled approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  this decrease of approximately million was comprised of other comprehensive loss of million and net loss of  partially offset by  from stock option exercises 
the book value per share of the company s common stock decreased from as of december   based upon  shares outstanding  as adjusted for treasury stock to as of december   based upon  shares outstanding at december   as adjusted for treasury stock 
regulatory capital requirements the company is required to comply with certain risk based capital adequacy guidelines issued by the frb and the fdic 
the risk based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank 
the guidelines also assign weights to the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts 
under these guidelines  banks are expected to meet a minimum target ratio for qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets of  at least one half of which is to be in the form of tier capital 
qualifying total capital is divided into two separate categories or tiers 
tier capital includes common stockholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill  tier capital components limited in the aggregate to one half of total qualifying capital includes allowances for credit losses within limits  certain excess levels of perpetual preferred stock and certain types of hybrid capital instruments  subordinated debt and other preferred stock 
applying the federal guidelines  the ratio of qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets  was and at december  and  respectively  and as required by the guidelines  at least one half of the qualifying total capital consisted of tier l capital elements 
tier l risk based capital ratios on december  and were and  respectively 
at december  and  the company exceeded the requirements for risk based capital adequacy under both federal and pennsylvania state guidelines 
under frb and fdic regulations  a bank and a holding company are deemed to be well capitalized when it has a leverage ratio tier l capital to total assets of at least  a tier l capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least  and a total capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least 
at december  and  the company s leverage ratio was and  respectively 
accordingly  at december  and  the company was considered well capitalized under frb and fdic regulations 
federal banking agencies impose three minimum capital requirements on the company s risk based capital ratios based on total capital  tier capital  and a leverage capital ratio 
the risk based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank s capital against the riskiness of its assets and off balance sheet activities 
failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for prompt corrective action or other regulatory enforcement action 
in assessing a bank s capital adequacy  regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  quality and level or earnings  concentrations of credit  quality of loans and investments  risks of any nontraditional activities  effectiveness of bank policies  and management s overall ability to monitor and control risks 
the following table presents the company s regulatory capital ratios at december  and actual for capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines dollars in thousands amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio at december  total risk based capital republic company 
tier one risk based capital republic company 
tier one leverage capital republic company 
at december  total risk based capital republic company 
tier one risk based capital republic company 
tier one leverage capital republic company 
management believes that the company and republic met  as of december  and  all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the fdic categorized republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the federal deposit insurance act 
there are no calculations or events since that notification  which management believes would have changed republic s category 
the company and republic s ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans  the impact of future economic events on republic s loan customers and republic s ability to manage its interest rate risk  growth and other operating expenses 
in addition to the above minimum capital requirements  federal banking regulators are required to take specified prompt corrective action when an insured institution s capital level falls below certain levels 
the rule defines five capital categories based on several of the above capital ratios 
republic currently exceeds the levels required for a bank to be classified as well capitalized 
however  the federal reserve may consider other criteria when determining such classifications  which criteria could result in a downgrading in such classifications 
the company s equity to assets ratio increased to as of december   from as of december  the increase at year end was the result of the million decrease in total assets at december  compared to december  the company s average equity to assets ratio for  and was  and  respectively 
the company s average return on equity for  and was  and  respectively  and its average return on assets for  and  was  and  respectively 
liquidity financial institutions must maintain liquidity to meet day to day requirements of depositors and borrowers  time investment purchases to market conditions and provide a cushion against unforeseen needs 
liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities 
the most liquid assets consist of cash  amounts due from banks and federal funds sold 
regulatory authorities require the company to maintain certain liquidity ratios such that republic maintains available funds  or can obtain available funds at reasonable rates  in order to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors 
in response to these requirements  the company has formed an asset liability committee alco  comprised of certain members of republic s board of directors and senior management  which monitors such ratios 
the purpose of the committee is  in part  to monitor republic s liquidity and adherence to the ratios in addition to managing relative interest rate risk 
the alco meets at least quarterly 
the company s most liquid assets  comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity 
at december   republic estimated that in excess of million of loans would mature or repay in the six month period ended june  additionally  the majority of its securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through pledges to the fhlb to access republic s line of credit 
funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates  buying federal funds or utilizing the facilities of the federal home loan bank system fhlb 
at december   republic had million in unused lines of credit available under arrangements with the fhlb and with correspondent banks  compared to million at december  the decrease in available lines resulted from the reduction in the secured lines of available credit 
management believes it satisfactorily exceeds regulatory liquidity guidelines 
these lines of credit enable republic to purchase funds for short to long term needs at rates often lower than other sources and require pledging of securities or loan collateral 
at december   the company had outstanding commitments including unused lines of credit and letters of credit of million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled million at december  the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current commitments 
in addition  the company can use term borrowings to replace these borrowed funds 
republic s target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of republic s interest earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities 
republic has established a contingency line of credit with a correspondent bank to assist in managing republic s liquidity position 
that line of credit totaled million at december  republic had drawn down on this line at december  republic has also established a line of credit with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately million 
that million capacity is reduced by advances outstanding to arrive at the unused line of credit available 
as of december  and  republic had borrowed million and million  respectively from the fhlb 
investment securities represent a primary source of liquidity for republic 
accordingly  investment decisions generally reflect liquidity over other considerations 
additionally  republic has uncollateralized overnight advances with pnc 
as of december  and  there were million and million of such overnight advances outstanding 
operating cash flows are primarily derived from cash provided from net income during the year and are another source of liquidity 
the company s primary short term funding sources are certificates of deposit and its securities portfolio 
the circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect those sources are as follows 
republic has historically been able to generate certificates of deposit by matching philadelphia market rates or paying a premium rate of to basis points over those market rates 
it is anticipated that this source of liquidity will continue to be available  however  the incremental cost may vary depending on market conditions 
the company s securities portfolio is also available for liquidity  most likely as collateral for fhlb advances 
in addition  numerous investment companies would likely provide repurchase agreements up to the amount of the market value of the securities 
the alco committee is responsible for managing the liquidity position and interest sensitivity of republic 
that committee s primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring republic s interest sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs 
investment securities portfolio republic s investment securities portfolio is intended to provide liquidity and contribute to earnings while diversifying credit risk 
the company attempts to maximize earnings while minimizing its exposure to interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio consists primarily of us government agency issued mortgage backed securities  municipal securities  corporate bonds and trust preferred securities 
the company s alco monitors and approves all security purchases 
the decline in securities in primarily reflected the maturity of an eighteen month security 
the increase in the total amortized cost of securities in primarily reflected the purchase of mortgage backed securities

for certain securities which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability  and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence level 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
management s best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain level investments 
internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker dealers where available were used to support fair values of certain level investments 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include all of the company s us government and agency securities  municipal obligations and corporate bonds 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
as required by sfas no 
 the company does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments 
level is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  and may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability  with such adjustment generally based on available market evidence 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
subsequent to inception  management only changes level inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments  completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities  subsequent rounds of financing  recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure  offerings in the equity or debt markets  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows 
the level investment securities classified as available for sale are comprised of various issues of bank pooled trust preferred securities 
bank pooled trust preferred consists of the debt instruments of various banks  diversified by the number of participants in the security as well as geographically 
the securities are performing according to terms  however the secondary market for such securities has become inactive  and such securities are therefore classified as level securities 
the fair value analysis does not reflect or represent the actual terms or prices at which any party could purchase the securities 
there is currently no secondary market for the securities and there can be no assurance that any secondary market for the securities will develop 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the securities available for sale measured as fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable imputs level for the year ended december in thousands beginning balance  january securities transferred to level measurement during unrealized losses arising during impairment charge on level security other  including proceeds from calls of investment securities ending balance  december a third party pricing service was used in the development of the fair market valuation 
the calculations used to determine fair value are based on the attributes of the trust preferred securities  the financial condition of the issuers of the trust preferred securities  and market based assumptions 
the intex cdo deal model library was utilized to obtain information regarding the attributes of each security and its specific collateral as of december  financial information on the issuers was also obtained from bloomberg  the fdic and the office of thrift supervision 
both published and unpublished industry sources were utilized in estimating fair value 
such information includes loan prepayment speed assumptions  discount rates  default rates  and loss severity percentages 
due to the current state of the global capital and financial markets  the fair market valuation is subject to greater uncertainty that would otherwise exist 
fair market valuation for each security was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses 
the cash flows are primarily dependent on the estimated speeds at which the trust preferred securities are expected to prepay  the estimated rates at which the trust preferred securities are expected to defer payments  the estimated rates at which the trust preferred securities are expected to default  and the severity of the losses on securities which default 
prepayment assumptions 
due to the lack of new trust preferred issuances and the relativity poor conditions of the financial institution industry  the rate of voluntary prepayments are estimated at 
prepayments affect the securities in three ways 
first  prepayments lower the absolute amount of excess spread  an important credit enhancement 
second  the prepayments are directed to the senior tranches  the effect of which is to increase the overcollateralization of the mezzanine layer  the layer at which the company is located in each of the securities 
however  the prepayments can lead to adverse selection in which the strongest institutions have prepaid  leaving the weaker institutions in the pool  thus mitigating the effect of the increased overcollateralization 
third  prepayments can limit the numeric and geographic diversity of the pool  leading to concentration risks 
deferral and default rates 
trust preferred securities include a provision that allows the issuing bank to defer interest payments for up to five years 
the estimates for the rates of deferral are based on the financial condition of the trust preferred issuers in the pool 
estimates for the conditional default rates are based on the trust preferred securities themselves as well as the financial condition of the trust preferred issuers in the pool 
estimates for the near term rates of deferral and conditional default are based on key financial ratios relating to the financial institutions capitalization  asset quality  profitability and liquidity 
each bank in each security is evaluated based on ratings from outside services including standard poors  moodys  fitch  bankrate 
com and the street 
com 
recent stock price information is also considered  as well as the week high and low  for each bank in each security 
finally  the receipt of tarp funding is considered  and if so  the amount 
estimates for longer term rates of deferral and defaults are based on historical averages based on a research report issued by salomon smith barney in default is defined as any instance when a regulator takes an active role in a bank s operations under a supervisory action 
this definition of default is distinct from failure 
a bank is considered to have defaulted if it falls below minimum capital requirements or becomes subject to regulatory actions including a written agreement  or a cease and desist order 
the rates of deferral and conditional default are estimated at 
loss severity 
the fact that an issuer defaults on a loan  does not necessarily mean that the investor will lose all of their investment 
thus  it is important to understand not only the default assumption  but also the expected loss given a default  or the loss severity assumption 
both standard poors and moody s analytics have performed and published research that indicate that recoveries on trust preferred securities are low less than 
the loss severity estimates are estimated at a range of to 
ratings agencies 
the major ratings agencies have recently been cutting the ratings on various trust preferred securities bond waterfall 
the trust preferred securities have several tranches senior tranches  mezzanine tranches and the residual or income tranches 
the company invested in the mezzanine tranches for all of its trust preferred securities 
the senior and mezzanine tranches were overcollateralized at issuance  meaning that the par value of the underlying collateral was more than the balance issued on the tranches 
the terms generally provide that if the performing collateral balances fall below certain triggers  then income is diverted from the residual tranches to pay the senior and mezzanine tranches 
however  if significant deferrals occur  income could also be diverted from the mezzanine tranches to pay the senior tranches 
internal rate of return 
internal rates of return are the pre tax yield rates used to discount the future cash flow stream expected from the collateral cash flow 
the marketplace for the trust preferred securities at december  was not active 
this is evidenced by a significant widening of the bid ask spreads the markets in which the trust preferred securities trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
the new issue market is also inactive 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the discount rates to be used when a market is not active 
the discount rate should take into account the time value of money  price for bearing the uncertainty in the cash flows and other case specific factors that would be considered by market participants  including a liquidity adjustment 
the discount rate used is a libor month forward looking curve plus basis points 
loan portfolio the company s loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate loans  loans secured by one to four family residential property  commercial construction and residential construction loans as well as residential mortgages  home equity loans and other consumer loans 
commercial loans are primarily secured term loans made to small to medium sized businesses and professionals for working capital  asset acquisition and other purposes 
commercial loans are originated as either fixed or variable rate loans with typical terms of to years 
republic s commercial loans typically range between  and million but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to republic s legal lending limit of approximately million at december  individual customers may have several loans often secured by different collateral 
such relationships in excess of million an internal monitoring guideline which approximates of capital and reserves at december   amounted to million 
there were no loans in excess of the legal lending limit at december  the company s total loans decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  that decrease reflected a million  or  decrease in real estate secured loans  which represents the company s largest loan category 
the decrease also reflected a million  or  decrease in construction loans and a decrease of million  or  decrease in non real estate secured loans  which was partially offset by a million  or  increase in non real estate unsecured loans

a committee of the board of directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained  while approving the majority of commercial loans 
loans  including impaired loans  are generally classified as non accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than days may also be classified as non accrual if repayment in full of principal and or interest is in doubt 
loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time  and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower  in accordance with the contractual terms 
while a loan is classified as non accrual or as an impaired loan and the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is doubtful  collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding 
when the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is expected  interest income may be recognized on a cash basis 
for non accrual loans which have been partially charged off  recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate 
cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge offs have been fully recovered

non performing assets are composed of non performing loans and other real estate owned 
non accrual loans decreased million  to million at december   from million at december  an analysis of activity is as follows 
the million decrease reflected million of transfers of loans to two customers to other real estate owned after related charge offs of million and payoffs of million 
the resulting decrease was partially offset by the transition of fifteen loans totaling million to non accrual status 
problem loans consist of loans that are included in performing loans  but for which potential credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to continue to comply with present repayment terms 
at december   all identified problem loans are included in the preceding table  or are internally classified with a specific reserve allocation in the allowance for loan losses see allowance for loan losses 
the following summary shows the impact on interest income of non accrual loans  subsequent to being placed on non accrual  for the periods indicated for the year ended december  interest income that would have been recorded had the loans been in accordance with their original terms interest income included in net income at december   the company had no foreign loans and no loan concentrations exceeding of total loans except for credits extended to real estate operators and lessors in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  various types of real estate are included in this category  including industrial  retail shopping centers  office space  residential multi family and others

in  the company charged off loans to three customers totaling million prior to the transfer of the remaining loan balances to other real estate owned 
in  the company charged off commercial loans to three borrowers totaling million 
there were no charge offs on tax refund loans in and as the company did not purchase tax refund loans in those years 
recoveries on tax refund loans decreased to  in  from  in as a result of the discontinuation of the tax refund loan program in management makes at least a quarterly determination as to an appropriate provision from earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses that management determines is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the company s board of directors periodically reviews the status of all non accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by republic s regulators or internal loan review officer  who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the board of directors also considers specific loans  pools of similar loans  historical charge off activity  economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses 
the company has an existing loan review program  which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis 
loan review is conducted by a loan review officer who reports quarterly  directly to the board of directors 
estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult  particularly in a continually changing economy 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at december  however  there can be no assurance that  if asset quality deteriorates in future periods  additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
republic s management is unable to determine in which loan category future charge offs and recoveries may occur 
the following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories 
the allocation is accordingly based upon historical experience 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category at december  dollars in thousands allocation of the allowance for loan losses amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans commercial construction residential real estate consumer and other unallocated total gross loans net of unearned income 
the methodology utilized to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses is as follows the company first applies an estimated loss percentage against all loans which are not specifically reserved 
in  excluding tax refund loans  the company experienced net charge offs to average loans of approximately 
net recoveries and net charge offs  respectively  excluding tax refund loans  to average loans were   and in   and in the absence of sustained charge off history  management estimates loss percentages based upon the purpose and or collateral of various commercial loan categories 
while such loss percentages exceed the percentages suggested by historical experience longer than over the past five years  the company maintained those percentages in due to the economic downturn  the company will continue to evaluate these percentages and may adjust these estimates on the basis of charge off history  economic conditions  industry experience or other relevant factors 
the company also provides specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance  when the collateral is the only source of repayment 
also  the company estimates and recognizes reserve allocations on loans classified as internally classified accruing loans based upon any factor that might impact loss estimates 
those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and management s potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition 
the unallocated component decreased  from  at december  to  at december  as the company integrated the revised interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses issued by the fdic in december as of december   the unallocated component decreased  to  from  at december  as of december   the unallocated component decreased  to  from  at december  total loans at december   decreased to million from million at the prior year end 
the unallocated allowance is established for losses that have not been identified through the formulaic and other specific components of the allowance as described above 
the unallocated portion is more subjective and requires a high degree of management judgment and experience 
management has identified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments 
these factors consist of macro and micro economic conditions  industry and geographic loan concentrations  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  changes in underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates 
the impact of the above is considered in light of management s conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors 
the majority of the company s loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes  while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans 
the company attempts to evaluate larger loans individually  on the basis of its loan review process  which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis  and other available information 
even if all commercial purpose loans could be reviewed  there is no assurance that information on potential problems would be available 
the company s portfolios of loans made for purposes of financing residential mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated in groups

dollars in thousands thereafter total variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest 
an entity is subject to consolidation under fin if the investors either do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  are unable to direct the entity s activities  or are not exposed to the entity s losses or entitled to its residual returns variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
management previously determined that each of the company s current and former subsidiary trusts  trust i  trust ii  trust iii and trust iv  qualifies as a variable interest entity under fin trust i originally issued mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to investors and loaned the proceeds to the company 
the securities were subsequently refinanced via a call during from proceeds of an issuance by trust ii 
trust ii holds  as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by the company in the company issued an additional million of pooled trust preferred securities in june trust iii holds  as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by the company in in june  the company issued an additional million of convertible trust preferred securities 
trust iv holds as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by the company in the company does not consolidate its subsidiary trusts 
fin r precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred stock when determining if the company has the right to a majority of the trusts expected residual returns 
the non consolidation results in the investment in the common securities of the trusts to be included in other assets with a corresponding increase in outstanding debt of  in addition  the income received on the company s investment in the common securities of the trusts is included in other income 
the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations 
the federal reserve has issued final guidance on the regulatory capital treatment for the trust preferred securities issued by the capital trusts as a result of the adoption of fin r 
the final rule would retain the current maximum percentage of total capital permitted for trust preferred securities at  but would enact other changes to the rules governing trust preferred securities that affect their use as part of the collection of entities known as restricted core capital elements 
the rule would take effect march   however  a five year transition period starting march  and leading up to that date would allow bank holding companies to continue to count trust preferred securities as tier capital after applying fin r 
management has evaluated the effects of the final rule and does not anticipate a material impact on its capital ratios 
effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is the company s need and ability to react to changes in interest rates 
as discussed previously  management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations
