risk factors and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included under item financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this annual report 
overview transocean ltd 
together with its subsidiaries and predecessors  unless the context requires otherwise  transocean  the company  we  us or our is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells 
as of february   we owned  had partial ownership interests in or operated mobile offshore drilling units 
as of this date  our fleet consisted of high specification floaters ultra deepwater  deepwater and harsh environment semisubmersibles and drillships  midwater floaters  high specification jackups  standard jackups and four other rigs 
in addition  we had ultra deepwater floaters under construction or contracted for construction 
we believe our mobile offshore drilling fleet is one of the most modern and versatile fleets in the world 
our primary business is to contract these drilling rigs  related equipment and work crews primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells 
we specialize in technically demanding segments of the offshore drilling business with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling services 
we also provide oil and gas drilling management services on either a dayrate basis or a completed project  fixed price or turnkey basis  as well as drilling engineering and drilling project management services  and we participate in oil and gas exploration and production activities 
in november  we completed our merger transaction the merger with globalsantafe corporation globalsantafe 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase  with the company as the acquirer for accounting purposes 
at the time of the merger  globalsantafe owned  had partial ownership interests in  operated  had under construction or contracted for construction  mobile offshore drilling units and other units utilized in the support of offshore drilling activities 
the balance sheet data as of december  represents the consolidated statement of financial position of the combined company 
the statement of operations and other financial data for the year ended december  include approximately one month of operating results and cash flows for the combined company 
in december  transocean ltd 
completed a transaction pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger among transocean ltd  transocean inc  which was our former parent holding company  and transocean cayman ltd  a company organized under the laws of the cayman islands that was a wholly owned subsidiary of transocean ltd  pursuant to which transocean inc merged by way of schemes of arrangement under cayman islands law with transocean cayman ltd  with transocean inc as the surviving company the redomestication transaction 
in the redomestication transaction  transocean ltd 
issued one of its shares in exchange for each ordinary share of transocean inc in addition  transocean ltd 
issued million of its shares to transocean inc for future use to satisfy transocean ltd 
s obligations to deliver shares in connection with awards granted under our incentive plans  warrants or other rights to acquire shares of transocean ltd 
the redomestication transaction effectively changed the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from the cayman islands to switzerland 
as a result of the redomestication transaction  transocean inc became a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of transocean ltd 
in connection with the redomestication transaction  we relocated our principal executive offices to vernier  switzerland 
we refer to the redomestication transaction and the relocation of our principal executive offices together as the redomestication 
key measures of our total company results of operations and financial condition are as follows years ended december  change in millions  except average daily revenue and percentages average daily revenue a b utilization b c n a statement of operations data operating revenues operating and maintenance expenses operating income net income balance sheet data at end of period cash and cash equivalents total assets total debt n a means not applicable 
a average daily revenue is defined as contract drilling revenue earned per revenue earning day 
a revenue earning day is defined as a day for which a rig earns dayrate after commencement of operations 
b excludes a drillship engaged in scientific geological coring activities  the joides resolution  that is owned by a joint venture in which we have a percent interest and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
c utilization is the total actual number of revenue earning days as a percentage of the total number of calendar days in the period 
we are currently experiencing high utilization and historically high dayrates across our fleet 
customers continue to express interest in multi year contracts for our high specification units 
recently  we have experienced weakness in our midwater floater fleet and in our jackup fleet  as near term customer demand has declined 
we currently have two midwater floaters  including one that is held for sale  and four jackups that are idle  and we expect to idle more rigs as they come off contracts 
we expect the decline in commodity prices and the downturn in the global economy to continue to have a negative effect on dayrates and the level of contract activity in these markets  and that effect could be substantial 
see item a 
risk factors for a discussion of some of the risks associated with a continued decline in commodity prices and an extended worldwide economic downturn 
over the last few years  a shortage of qualified personnel in our industry drove up compensation costs and suppliers increased prices as their backlogs grow 
we expect increasing unemployment  a stronger us dollar and a continued decline in commodity prices to slow the rate of escalation in these costs or cause these costs to decrease over time 
our revenues for the year ended december  increased from the prior year period primarily as a result of the addition of globalsantafe s operations for a full year and higher dayrates 
our operating and maintenance expenses for the year increased primarily as a result of higher labor and rig maintenance costs in connection with such increased activity as well as inflationary cost increases and the addition of globalsantafe s operations see outlook 
total debt decreased as a result of repayments of borrowings under the bridge loan facility during see liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of liquidity 
we have established two reportable segments contract drilling services and other operations 
the contract drilling segment consists of floaters  jackups and other rigs used in support of offshore drilling activities and offshore support services on a worldwide basis 
our fleet operates in a single  global market for the provision of contract drilling services 
the location of our rigs and the allocation of resources to build or upgrade rigs are determined by the activities and needs of our customers 
the other operations segment includes drilling management services and oil and gas properties 
we provide drilling management services through applied drilling technology inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  and through adt international  a division of one of our uk subsidiaries together  adti 
drilling management services are provided primarily on a turnkey basis at a fixed bid amount 
oil and gas properties consist of exploration  development and production activities carried out through our oil and gas subsidiaries  challenger minerals inc and challenger minerals north sea limited together  cmi 
significant events redomestication in december  we completed the redomestication transaction 
see overview 
in december  in connection with the redomestication transaction  we assumed transocean cayman s obligations under the warrants that were previously exercisable for ordinary shares of transocean cayman 
also in december  we guaranteed the obligations of transocean cayman under the indenture relating to transocean cayman s series a convertible senior notes due  series b convertible senior notes due and series c convertible senior notes due together  the convertible senior notes and senior notes due  senior notes due and senior notes due in addition  we assumed the obligation to deliver our shares  if any  upon conversion of the convertible senior notes  in lieu of transocean cayman ordinary shares 
we also guaranteed the obligations of transocean cayman under the indenture relating to transocean cayman s notes due  notes due  senior notes due  debentures due  notes due  senior notes due and notes due furthermore  in december  we guaranteed the payment of the principal and the accrued and unpaid interest on commercial paper notes issued or to be issued under transocean cayman s commercial paper program 
impairment loss during the year ended december   we recorded impairment losses of million  of which million was related to the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our drilling management services reporting unit 
additionally  we recognized an impairment loss of million associated with gsf arctic ii and gsf arctic iv after having determined that the rigs were subject to impairment indicators resulting from the credit crisis and the rapid decline in commodity prices 
we estimate the fair market value of the assets held for sale  goodwill and other intangibles based on our estimates and projections considering current market conditions and other factors 
asset dispositions during  we completed the sale of three of our standard jackups gsf adriatic iii  gsf high island i and gsf high island viii 
see liquidity and capital resources fleet expansion and dispositions 
bank credit agreements in march  transocean cayman entered into a term credit facility under the term credit agreement dated march  the term loan and borrowed billion under the facility 
in april  transocean cayman borrowed an additional million under the term loan 
in june  transocean cayman repaid the then outstanding balance under the bridge loan facility and terminated the facility 
see liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of liquidity 
in november  transocean cayman entered into a new credit agreement for a day  billion revolving credit facility the day revolving credit facility to replace its expiring billion revolving credit agreement entered into in december former day revolving credit facility and terminated the expiring agreement 
transocean cayman also amended its existing billion revolving credit facility the five year revolving credit facility and the term loan together with the day revolving credit facility and the five year revolving credit facility  the credit facilities in connection with the redomestication transaction 
upon completion of the redomestication transaction  transocean cayman became our wholly owned subsidiary  and we guaranteed transocean cayman s obligations under the credit facilities 
fleet expansion in april  we were awarded a drilling contract for discoverer india 
the ultra deepwater floater is expected to commence operations under a multi year drilling contract during the fourth quarter of see liquidity and capital resources fleet expansion and dispositions 
in june  we reached an agreement with subsidiaries of petrobras and mitsui to acquire a newbuild ultra deepwater floater  petrobras  under a capital lease contract 
in conjunction with the capital lease contract  we entered into a year drilling contract with subsidiaries of petrobras covering worldwide operations of the drillship with an option for petrobras to extend the term of the drilling contract by up to an additional years 
see liquidity and capital resources fleet expansion and dispositions 
floating rate notes in september  transocean cayman issued billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes  due september floating rate notes 
in september  transocean cayman repaid the floating rate notes at maturity 
angola deepwater drilling company in september  we acquired a percent interest in angola deepwater drilling company limited addcl  a cayman islands joint venture company 
outlook drilling market we were successful in building contract backlog in within all of our asset classes 
our contract backlog at february  was approximately billion 
a summary of our rigs that  as of february   had available uncommitted time in and is set forth below uncommitted rigs high specification floaters midwater floaters high specification jackups standard jackups we have been successful in building contract backlog within our high specification floaters fleet with of our current and future high specification floaters  including all of our newbuilds  contracted into or beyond as of february  these units also include of our current and future ultra deepwater floaters 
our total contract backlog of approximately billion as of february  includes an estimated billion of backlog represented by our high specification floaters 
the deepwater market benefits from the limited supply of deepwater capable rigs available for contract 
we believe the continued exploration successes in the deepwater offshore provinces of brazil  angola  india and us gulf of mexico will continue to drive significant demand for the ultra deepwater floaters and support our long term positive outlook for our high specification floater fleet 
with the expected demand for deepwater programs  we believe that the long term outlook for deepwater capable rigs continues to be very favorable 
we have a limited number of high specification floaters coming available in  which may result in limited or no new contracts in the near term 
additionally  the decline in commodity prices and the downturn in the global economy may have a near term negative effect on dayrates in the high specification floater fleet 
our midwater floaters fleet  which includes semisubmersible rigs  is percent committed to contracts that extend into however  near term customer demand has declined  resulting in a lack of tendering opportunities and the warm stacking of one of our midwater floaters and one midwater floater that is classified as held for sale 
weakness in the uk floater market  coupled with subletting of the existing rigs in this market and cancellations and delays in customer programs in other midwater floater markets  is expected to result in reduced dayrates and the stacking of additional rigs in this fleet in the near term 
we are also experiencing weakness in the jackup market 
as of february   we had warm stacked two jackups and cold stacked two jackups 
considering the number of jackups that are under construction without customer contracts and the lack of customer demand  we expect dayrates and utilization to decrease in our jackup fleet 
we believe the delivery of the uncontracted units will further adversely impact the market for jackups through  and potentially beyond  and is expected to result in the stacking of additional rigs in the near term 
with of our jackups completing their current contracts in  our exposure to market weakness is significant 
the decline in commodity prices  together with the difficult conditions in the credit markets  has had a negative impact on our business 
one of our clients has been placed into administration a form of bankruptcy proceeding in the uk  and another has been unable to post the required escrow leading us to terminate the contract 
continued low commodity prices may lead to further decreases in demand across all rig classes and  as a result  lower dayrates and utilization for our rigs or further idling rigs in our fleet 
as of february   the percentage of contract days in our uncommitted fleet for   and is as follows uncommitted fleet percentage high specification floaters midwater floaters high specification jackups standard jackups we expect our total revenues to be lower in than in although the commencement of new contracts with higher dayrates and the commencement of operations of five of our newbuilds and the sedco are expected to increase contract drilling revenues  both contract drilling intangible revenues and other revenues are expected to decline by a greater amount 
these lower revenues are expected as a result of the reduction of non drilling activity  the sale of three jackups in  the anticipated sale of gsf arctic ii and gsf arctic iv in and lost revenue associated with an expected increase in idle rigs 
we expect our total operating and maintenance costs in to decrease compared to due to lower operating costs associated with a number of jackups and midwater floaters that may be cold stacked during  exchange rate changes  the anticipated sale of gsf arctic ii and gsf arctic iv in and the sale of three jackups during in addition  we expect a reduction of support costs due to various overhead cost reduction initiatives and an expected decrease in non drilling activity 
these decreases are expected to be partially offset in by an increase in operating and maintenance costs as a result of the commencement of operations of five of our deepwater newbuilds and the sedco our actual operating and maintenance costs for remain uncertain given current economic and market conditions and could be significantly impacted by the actual level of activity and other factors 
we have nine existing contracts with fixed price or capped options  and we expect that a number of these fixed price options will not be exercised by our customers in in light of the current market environment 
well in progress or similar provisions in our existing contracts may delay the start of higher dayrates in subsequent contracts  and some of the delays have been and could be significant 
our operations are geographically dispersed in oil and gas exploration and development areas throughout the world 
rigs can be moved from one region to another  but the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary somewhat between regions 
however  significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility 
consequently  we operate in a single  global offshore drilling market 
insurance matters we periodically evaluate our hull and machinery and third party liability insurance limits and self insured retentions 
effective may   we renewed our hull and machinery and third party liability insurance coverages 
subject to large self insured retentions  we carry hull and machinery insurance covering physical damage to the rigs for operational risks worldwide  and we carry liability insurance covering damage to third parties 
however  we do not generally have commercial market insurance coverage for physical damage losses to our rigs due to hurricanes in the us gulf of mexico and war perils worldwide 
additionally  we do not carry insurance for loss of revenue 
also  for our subsidiaries adti and cmi  we generally self insure operators extra expense coverage 
this coverage provides protection against expenses related to well control and redrill liability associated with blowouts 
generally  adti s clients assume  and indemnify adti for  liability associated with blowouts in excess of million 
in the opinion of management  adequate accruals have been made based on known and estimated losses related to such exposures 
tax matters we are a swiss corporation and we operate through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world 
our tax provision is based upon the tax laws  regulations and treaties in effect in and between the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned 
our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes will fluctuate from year to year  as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
we are subject to changes in tax laws  treaties and regulations in and between the countries in which we operate and earn income 
a change in the tax laws  treaties or regulations in any of the countries in which we operate could result in a higher or lower effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and  as a result  could have a material effect on our financial results 
our income tax return filings in the major jurisdictions in which we operate worldwide are generally subject to examination for periods ranging from three to six years 
we have agreed to extensions beyond the statute of limitations in two jurisdictions for up to years 
tax authorities in certain jurisdictions are examining our tax returns and in some cases have issued assessments 
we are defending our tax positions in those jurisdictions 
while we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the final outcome of these proceedings  we do not expect the ultimate liability to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position or results of operations although it may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated cash flows 
with respect to our and us federal income tax returns  us taxing authorities previously proposed certain adjustments that  if sustained  would have resulted in a cash tax liability of approximately million  exclusive of interest 
the tax authorities have now withdrawn one of these proposed adjustments  which will significantly reduce the proposed assessment 
the authorities continue to contend that one of our key subsidiaries maintains a permanent establishment in the us and is  therefore  subject to us taxation on certain earnings effectively connected to such us business 
such tax treatment would not be expected to result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows with respect to and activities 
with respect to years following  us taxing authorities may continue to pursue the argument that one of our key subsidiaries maintains a permanent establishment in the us and is therefore subject to us taxation on certain earnings effectively connected to such us business 
since there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the us or maintaining a permanent establishment under an applicable treaty  we cannot be certain that the tax authorities will not be successful in their claim that we or any of our key subsidiaries is are engaged in a trade or business in the us or  when applicable  maintains a permanent establishment in the us if we were or any of our key subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the us when applicable  through a permanent establishment  we could be subject to us corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such us business  in which case our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings with respect to years following could increase substantially  and our earnings and cash flows from operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we believe our returns are materially correct as filed  and we will continue to vigorously defend against all such claims 
certain of our brazilian income tax returns for the years through are currently under examination 
the brazil tax authorities have issued tax assessments totaling million  plus a percent penalty and million of interest through december  the us dollar amount of the assessments decreased during due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we believe our returns are materially correct as filed  and we are vigorously contesting these assessments 
we filed a protest letter with the brazilian tax authorities on january   and we are currently engaged in the appeals process 
norwegian civil tax and criminal authorities are investigating various transactions undertaken by our subsidiaries in and the authorities have issued a tax assessment of approximately million  plus interest  related to a dividend payment 
we plan to appeal this tax assessment 
we may be required to provide some form of financial security  in an amount up to million  for these assessed amounts as this dispute is appealed and addressed by the norwegian courts 
furthermore  the authorities have also issued notifications of their intent to issue tax assessments of approximately million  plus interest  related to certain restructuring transactions  approximately million  plus interest  related to certain foreign exchange deductions  and approximately million  plus interest  related to the migration of a subsidiary that was previously subject to tax in norway 
the authorities have indicated that they plan to seek penalties of percent on all matters 
we have and will continue to respond to all information requests from the norwegian authorities 
we plan to vigorously contest any assertions by the norwegian authorities in connection with the various transactions being investigated 
during the year ended december   our long term liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to these norwegian tax issues decreased by million to million due to exchange rate fluctuations partially offset by the accrual of interest 
while we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the final outcome of these proceedings  we do not expect the ultimate resolution of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position or results of operations although it may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated cash flows

regulatory matters in june  globalsantafe s management retained outside counsel to conduct an internal investigation of its nigerian and west african operations  focusing on brokers who handled customs matters with respect to its affiliates operating in those jurisdictions and whether those brokers have fully complied with the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and local laws 
globalsantafe commenced its investigation following announcements by other oilfield service companies that they were independently investigating the fcpa implications of certain actions taken by third parties in respect of customs matters in connection with their operations in nigeria  as well as another company s announced settlement implicating a third party handling customs matters in nigeria 
in each case  the customs broker was reported to be panalpina inc  which globalsantafe used to obtain temporary import permits for its rigs operating offshore nigeria 
globalsantafe voluntarily disclosed its internal investigation to the us department of justice the doj and the securities and exchange commission sec and  at their request  expanded its investigation to include the activities of its customs brokers in other west african countries and the activities of panalpina inc worldwide 
the investigation is focusing on whether the brokers have fully complied with the requirements of their contracts  local laws and the fcpa 
in late november  globalsantafe received a subpoena from the sec for documents related to its investigation 
in this connection  the sec advised globalsantafe that it had issued a formal order of investigation 
after the completion of the merger  outside counsel began formally reporting directly to the audit committee of our board of directors 
our legal representatives are keeping the doj and sec apprised of the scope and details of their investigation and producing relevant information in response to their requests 
on july   our legal representatives met with the doj in response to a notice we received requesting such a meeting regarding our engagement of panalpina inc for freight forwarding and other services in the us and abroad 
the doj informed us that it is conducting an investigation of alleged fcpa violations by oil service companies who used panalpina inc and other brokers in nigeria and other parts of the world 
we developed an investigative plan which has continued to be amended and which would allow us to review and produce relevant and responsive information requested by the doj and sec 
the investigation was expanded to include one of our agents for nigeria 
this investigation and the legacy globalsantafe investigation are being conducted by outside counsel who reports directly to the audit committee of our board of directors 
the investigation has focused on whether the agent and the customs brokers have fully complied with the terms of their respective agreements  the fcpa and local laws 
our outside counsel has coordinated their efforts with the doj and the sec with respect to the implementation of our investigative plan  including keeping the doj and sec apprised of the scope and details of the investigation and producing relevant information in response to their requests 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these investigations  the total costs to be incurred in completing the investigations  the potential impact on personnel  the effect of implementing any further measures that may be necessary to ensure full compliance with applicable laws or to what extent  if at all  we could be subject to fines  sanctions or other penalties 
our internal compliance program has detected a potential violation of us sanctions regulations in connection with the shipment of goods to our operations in turkmenistan 
goods bound for our rig in turkmenistan were shipped through iran by a freight forwarder 
iran is subject to a number of economic regulations  including sanctions administered by the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control ofac  and comprehensive restrictions on the export and re export of us origin items to iran 
iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the us state department 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to sanctions and export restrictions may subject us to criminal sanctions and civil remedies  including fines  denial of export privileges  injunctions or seizures of our assets 
see item a 
risk factors our non us operations involve additional risks not associated with our us operations 
we have self reported the potential violation to ofac and retained outside counsel who is conducting an investigation of the matter 
performance and other key indicators contract backlog the following table presents our contract backlog  including firm commitments only  for our contract drilling segment as of december  and firm commitments are represented by signed drilling contracts or  in some cases  by other definitive agreements awaiting contract execution 
our contract backlog is calculated by multiplying the full contractual operating dayrate by the number of days remaining in the firm contract period  excluding revenues for mobilization  demobilization and contract preparation or other incentive provisions  which are not expected to be significant to our contract drilling revenues

our primary uses of cash were capital expenditures including for newbuild construction  repayments of borrowings under our credit facilities and the repayment of the floating rate notes at maturity 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we include investments in highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or less in cash and cash equivalents 
as of september   we had million invested in the reserve primary fund and million invested in the reserve international liquidity fund ltd 
in september  the reserve announced that certain funds had lost the ability to maintain a net asset value of per share due to losses in connection with the bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings  inc lehman holdings 
according to public disclosures by the reserve  the reserve stopped processing redemption requests in order to develop an orderly plan of liquidation that would protect all of the funds shareholders 
based on statements made by the funds  in september we reclassified million from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and recorded an impairment charge in the third quarter of in the amount of million associated with our proportional interest in the debt instruments of lehman holdings held by the funds until such time as we receive our liquidated portion of the assets 
our statement of cash flows presents a use of cash in the amount of this reclassification 
as of december   we had received million invested in the reserve primary fund 
following december   we received million invested in the reserve international fund and another million invested in the reserve primary fund 
at february   the carrying values of our investments in the reserve primary fund and the reserve international liquidity fund were million and million  respectively 
the timing of our ability to access the remaining funds is uncertain but is expected to be during potential rulings or decisions by courts or regulators may impact further distributions by the funds

c the costs for discoverer luanda represent percent of expenditures incurred since inception 
however  angco cayman limited shares percent of these costs beginning on the date of its investment in addcl 
d in june  we reached an agreement with subsidiaries of petrobras and mitsui to acquire petrobras  under a capital lease contract 
the capital lease contract  which is expected to commence in the third quarter of  has a year term  after which we will have the right and obligation to acquire the drillship for one dollar 
total capital costs to be incurred by petrobras and mitsui for the construction of the drillship are estimated to be million  including million of capitalized interest 
upon delivery of the rig  we will record a liability for the capital lease obligation and a corresponding addition to property and equipment based on the fair value at that date 
we are offering assistance and advisory services for the construction of petrobras and have agreed to provide operating management services once the drillship begins operations 
during  we expect capital expenditures to be approximately billion  including approximately billion for our major construction and conversion projects and million in non cash capital cost related to the petrobras capital lease 
the level of our capital expenditures is partly dependent upon financial market conditions  the actual level of operational and contracting activity and the level of capital expenditures for which our customers agree to reimburse us 
our expected capital expenditures during do not include amounts that would be incurred as a result of other possible newbuild opportunities 
as with any major shipyard project that takes place over an extended period of time  the actual costs  the timing of expenditures and the project completion date may vary from estimates based on numerous factors  including actual contract terms  weather  exchange rates  shipyard labor conditions and the market demand for components and resources required for drilling unit construction 
see item a 
risk factors our shipyard projects are subject to delays and cost overruns 
we intend to fund the cash requirements relating to our capital expenditures through available cash balances  cash generated from operations and asset sales 
we also have available credit under the five year revolving credit facility and the day revolving credit facility see sources and uses of liquidity and may utilize other commercial bank or capital market financings 
we intend to fund the cash requirements of our joint ventures for capital expenditures in connection with newbuild construction through their respective credit facilities 
the continued credit crisis and related instability in the global financial system could impact the availability of these sources of funding 
see item a

we received cash proceeds of million associated with the sale  which had no effect on earnings 
in may  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our standard jackup transocean nordic for cash proceeds of million 
in december  the buyer failed to perform under the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  the buyer forfeited an escrow deposit in the amount of million  which we recognized as a gain  recorded in other income  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  we classified the rig as an asset held and used  recorded in property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet 
in july  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell two midwater floaters gsf arctic ii and gsf arctic iv in connection with our previously announced undertakings to the office of fair trading in the uk oft 
the acquisition of the rigs was contingent upon the buyers ability to obtain lender consents 
the buyers have reported that they have been unable to obtain the consent of their lenders on terms acceptable to them and have publicly announced their termination of the agreement to purchase the vessels 
at december   both gsf arctic ii and gsf arctic iv continue to be marketed for sale and are classified as assets held for sale in the aggregate amount of million on our consolidated balance sheet 
the market for midwater floaters appears to have deteriorated subsequent to december   and we have a limited amount of time to sell the rigs 
consequently  we can make no assurances as to whether we are able to sell the rigs  the timing of the sale or any terms of the sale  including price 
any sale at a price below our valuation would result in an additional write down of the asset carrying value 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note impairment loss 
sources and uses of liquidity we expect to use existing cash balances  internally generated cash flows and proceeds from asset sales to fulfill anticipated obligations such as scheduled debt maturities  repayment of short term debt  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we may also use a portion of such sources of cash to reduce debt including convertible debt prior to scheduled maturity through repurchases in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  redemptions or tender offers  or to make repayments on bank borrowings or to repurchase our shares  subject in each case to then existing market conditions and to our then expected liquidity needs 
our board of directors has recommended that our shareholders approve a share repurchase program 
if approved  we may use our cash flow from other than debt to fund this program 
see share repurchase program recommendation 
from time to time  we may also use bank lines of credit and commercial paper borrowing to maintain liquidity for short term cash needs 
although commercial paper markets have improved considerably  our access to the commercial paper markets was impacted by the credit crisis in the third quarter of if the markets experience further instability  we may be required to rely more heavily on our bank lines of credit 
our access to debt and equity markets may be reduced or closed to us due to a variety of events  including among others  credit rating agency downgrades of our debt  industry conditions  general economic conditions  market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry 
the continued credit crisis and related instability in the global financial system has had  and may continue to have  an impact on our business and our financial condition 
we may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve 
our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access such markets  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
the credit crisis could have an impact on the lenders participating in our credit facilities or on our customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
our internally generated cash flow is directly related to our business and the market sectors in which we operate 
should the drilling market deteriorate  or should we experience poor results in our operations  cash flow from operations may be reduced 
we have  however  continued to generate positive cash flow from operating activities over recent years and expect that cash flow will continue to be positive over the next year

although there was no change to the conversion rate as a result of the redomestication  it triggered the right of holders to convert the convertible notes at any time beginning on december   which was the date days prior to the effective time of the redomestication the effective time of december   and ending on february   which was the th scheduled trading day following the effective time 
prior to the expiration of this period  we received conversion notices with respect to  principal amount of convertible notes and expect to pay an aggregate amount of  to the holders upon settlement 
share repurchase program recommendation in february  our board of directors recommended that our shareholders approve and authorize the repurchase of an amount of our shares with an aggregate purchase price of up to billion swiss francs which is equivalent to approximately us billion at an exchange rate as of the close of trading on february  of us to swiss francs 
shareholder approval is being sought in order to provide the company with the flexibility to repurchase shares at any time after the may annual general meeting 
if the share repurchase program is approved by the shareholders  there can be no assurance that any shares will actually be repurchased in the near term after the meeting  or at all 
the board of directors would be permitted to delegate its share repurchase authority to company management to repurchase shares under the share repurchase program 
the board of directors or company management  as applicable  may decide  based upon the company s ongoing capital requirements  the price of the company s shares  regulatory considerations  cash flow generation  the relationship between the company s contractual backlog and debt  general market conditions and other factors  that the company should retain cash  reduce debt  make capital investments or otherwise use cash for general corporate purposes  and consequently repurchase fewer shares or not repurchase any shares 
decisions regarding the amount  if any  and timing of any share repurchases would be made from time to time based upon the factors set forth above 
the company plans to fund any share repurchases from the company s current and future cash balances and will not use debt to fund any repurchases 
the board of directors has decided to recommend that the shareholders at their may annual general meeting approve the release of swiss statutory reserves  which is necessary for this authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares for cancellation 
any shares repurchased under this program are expected to be purchased from time to time from market participants that have acquired those shares on the open market and that can fully recover swiss withholding tax resulting from the share repurchase 
repurchases could also be made by tender offer  in privately negotiated transactions or by any other share repurchase method 
any repurchased shares would be held by the company for cancellation by the shareholders at a future annual general meeting 
the share repurchase program would not have an established expiration date and could be suspended or discontinued by the company s board of directors or company management  as applicable  at any time 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations included in the table below are at face value 
for the years ending december  total thereafter in millions contractual obligations debt interest on debt operating leases capital leases stock warrant consideration purchase obligations defined benefit pension plans total bondholders may  at their option  require transocean cayman to repurchase the series a notes and the series b notes in december and  respectively 
in addition  holders of any series of the convertible notes may  at their option  require transocean cayman to repurchase their notes in december    and the chart above assumes that the holders of the notes exercise the options at the first available date 
capital leases includes our estimated future obligations associated with our newbuild petrobras  which will be held under capital lease 
due to market conditions  the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans in future periods cannot be reasonably estimated 
additionally  we are awaiting guidance related to the enactment of the pension protection act  which is expected to have an effect on the amounts associated with our minimum funding requirements 
as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions  net of prepayments was million 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the liabilities recognized in this balance  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
other commercial commitments at december   we had other commitments that we are contractually obligated to fulfill with cash should the obligations be called 
these obligations include standby letters of credit and surety bonds that guarantee our performance as it relates to our drilling contracts  insurance  customs  tax and other obligations in various jurisdictions 
letters of credit are issued under a number of facilities provided by several banks 
the obligations that are the subject of these surety bonds and letters of credit are geographically concentrated in nigeria and india 
these letters of credit and surety bond obligations are not normally called as we typically comply with the underlying performance requirement 
the following table provides a list of these obligations in us dollar equivalents and their time to expiration 
for the years ending december  total thereafter in millions other commercial commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds total we have established a wholly owned captive insurance company which insures various risks of our operating subsidiaries 
access to the cash investments of the captive insurance company may be limited due to local regulatory restrictions 
these cash investments totaled million at december  and are expected to rise to approximately million by the end of our estimate is dependent on the level of claims that will be incurred in and assumes the actual level of premiums paid to the captive insurance company continues to increase 
derivative instruments we have established policies and procedures for derivative instruments that have been approved by our board of directors 
these policies and procedures provide for the prior approval of derivative instruments by our chief financial officer 
from time to time  we may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments in connection with the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes  however  for accounting purposes  certain transactions may not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
at december   we had no outstanding foreign exchange or interest rate derivative instruments 
in january  tpdi entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of million  which are designated as cash flow hedge of the variable rate borrowings under the tpdi credit facilities  to reduce the variability of its cash interest payments 
under the interest rate swaps  tpdi will receive interest at three month libor and pay interest at a fixed rate of percent over the expected term of the tpdi credit facilities 
in february  transocean cayman entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of billion  which are designated as a cash flow hedge of a portion of transocean cayman s borrowings under the term loan to reduce the variability of its cash interest payments 
under the interest rate swaps  transocean cayman will receive interest at one month libor and pay interest at a fixed rate of percent over the six month period ending august  these hedges are expected to be highly effective 
any gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the hedge  therefore  will be reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently  recognized in interest expense upon settlement coinciding with the forecasted transaction 
any gain or loss associated with the ineffective portion will be recognized in interest expense in the period in which it is realized

critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with disclosures included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements related to estimates  contingencies and new accounting pronouncements 
significant accounting policies are discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  materials and supplies obsolescence  investments  property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  workers insurance  share based compensation  pensions and other post retirement and employment benefits and contingent liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following to be our most critical accounting policies 
we have discussed each of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
income taxes we are a swiss corporation that operates through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world 
we have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
the countries in which we operate have taxation regimes with varying nominal rates  deductions  credits and other tax attributes 
there is no expected relationship between the provision for or benefit from income taxes and income or loss before income taxes because the countries have taxation regimes that vary not only with respect to the nominal tax rate  but also in terms of the availability of deductions  credits and other benefits 
variations also arise when income earned and taxed in a particular country or countries fluctuates from year to year 
our annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination and evaluation of our annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction would impact our tax liability in any given year 
we also operate in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the offshore drilling industry are not well developed 
while our annual tax provision is based on the best information available at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions are determined 
we maintain liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
our annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to permanent establishment positions  intercompany pricing  disposition transactions and the applicability or rate of various withholding taxes 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause us to conclude a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
we are currently undergoing examinations in a number of taxing jurisdictions for various fiscal years 
we believe that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we review these liabilities quarterly and to the extent the audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year  the effect will be recognized in the period of the event 
we do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
judgment  assumptions and estimates are required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is estimated to be more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carryforwards  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are considered at the time to be unrealizable 
resulting from a change of circumstances in  we believe that we will realize the benefits of our foreign tax credits in the us as such  we released the entire associated valuation allowance against us foreign tax credits of approximately million 
there were no significant changes to our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in see results of operations historical compared to and results of operations historical compared to we continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets 
we have not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
should we make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we may be required to record additional taxes 
because we cannot predict when  if at all  we will make a distribution of these unremitted earnings  we are unable to make a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability 
we have not provided for deferred taxes in circumstances where we expect that  due to the structure of operations and applicable law  the operations in that jurisdiction will not give rise to future tax consequences 
should our expectations change regarding the expected future tax consequences  we may be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
goodwill we had approximately billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we conduct impairment testing for our goodwill annually as of october and more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we test goodwill at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management 
we have determined that our reporting units for this purpose are contract drilling services  drilling management services and oil and gas properties 
to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  we use a combination of generally accepted valuation methodologies  including both income and market approaches 
for our contract drilling services reporting unit  we estimate the fair market value using discounted cash flows and publicly traded company multiples 
we discount projected cash flows using a long term weighted average cost of capital  which is based on our estimate of the investment returns that market participants would require for each of our reporting units 
to develop the projected cash flows associated with our contract drilling services reporting unit  which are based on estimated future utilization and dayrates  we consider key factors that include assumptions regarding future commodity prices  credit market uncertainties and the effect these factors may have on our contract drilling operations and the capital expenditure budgets of our customers 
we derive publicly traded company multiples for companies with operations similar to our reporting units using information on shares traded on stock exchanges and  when they are available  from analyses of recent acquisitions in the marketplace 
for our drilling management services reporting unit  we estimate fair market value using estimated discounted cash flows based on assumptions for future commodity prices  projected demand for our services  rig availability and dayrates 
in determining the fair value of our oil and gas properties reporting unit  we use a reserves analysis  which is a form of the market approach that considers the changes in the commodity prices 
because our business is cyclical in nature  the results of our impairment testing is expected to vary significantly depending on the timing of the performance of the assessment in relation to the business cycle 
altering either the timing of or the assumptions used in the calculations could result in estimating a reporting unit fair value that is significantly below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill 
in calculating the fair values of our reporting units for our annual and interim impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of  we applied discount rates of nine percent and percent and terminal growth rates of three percent and zero percent to our contract drilling services reporting unit and drilling management services reporting unit  respectively 
as a result of our tests  we recorded an impairment of goodwill associated with our drilling management services reporting unit 
furthermore  we performed sensitivity analyses of our valuations assuming a hypothetical three percent increase in the discount rate and a hypothetical percent decrease in our projected cash flows 
applying these hypothetical assumptions to the impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill associated with our contract drilling services reporting unit 
property and equipment property and equipment represents approximately percent of our total assets 
we determine the carrying value of these assets based on our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate our estimates  assumptions  and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of our rigs 
our policies are designed to appropriately and consistently capitalize costs incurred to enhance  improve and extend the useful lives of our assets and expense those costs incurred to repair and maintain the existing condition of our rigs 
capitalized costs increase the carrying values and depreciation expense of the related assets  which would also impact our results of operations 
we depreciate our assets over their estimated useful lives  which we determine by applying assumptions and judgments that reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and asset performance 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in establishing the useful lives of our rigs would likely result in materially different net book values of our assets and results of operations 
useful lives of rigs are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including technological advances that impact the methods or cost of oil and gas exploration and development  changes in market or economic conditions  and changes in laws or regulations affecting the drilling industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our rigs when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the rig and include changes in operating condition  functional capability and market and economic factors 
we also consider major capital upgrades required to perform certain contracts and the long term impact of those upgrades on the future marketability when assessing the useful lives of individual rigs 
a one year increase in the useful lives of all of our rigs would cause a decrease in our annual depreciation expense of approximately million while a one year decrease would cause an increase in our annual depreciation expense of approximately million 
we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may be impaired or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
some of the potential indicators include rapid declines in commodity prices and related market conditions  actual or expected declines in utilization or increases in idle time  cancellations of contracts or credit concerns of multiple clients 
supply and demand are the key drivers of rig utilization and our ability to contract our rigs at economical rates 
during periods of an oversupply  it is not uncommon for us to have rigs idled for extended periods of time  which could indicate that an asset group may be impaired 
our rigs are mobile units  equipped to operate in geographic regions throughout the world and  consequently  we may move rigs from an oversupplied market sector to one that is more lucrative and undersupplied when it is economical to do so 
as such  our rigs are considered to be interchangeable within classes or asset groups and accordingly  we perform our impairment evaluation by asset group 
we consider our asset groups to be ultra deepwater floaters  deepwater floaters  harsh environment floaters  midwater floaters  high specification jackups  standard jackups and other rigs 
we assess asset impairment using estimated undiscounted cash flows for the assets being evaluated by applying assumptions regarding future operations  market conditions  dayrates  utilization and idle time 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount of assets within an asset group is not recoverable 
the evaluation requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenues and costs 
in turn  these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific asset groups and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
fair value of assets acquired we accounted for the merger using the purchase method of accounting as defined under sfas no 
 business combinations  and the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill 
we estimated the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the merger  and these estimates were subject to adjustment based on our final assessments of the fair values of property and equipment  intangible assets  liabilities and our evaluation of tax positions and contingencies 
these assessments were completed within one year of the date of the merger 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note business combination 
our estimates of fair value of property and equipment were subjective based on the age and condition of rigs acquired and the determination of the remaining useful lives of the rigs 
we estimated the fair values of rigs acquired based on input from a third party broker  and values were appraised based on perceptions of potential buyers and sellers in the market  which generally renders a low trading volume of rigs in the secondary market 
the valuation of a rig and our estimate of the remaining useful life can also vary based on the rig design  condition and particular equipment configuration 
it can be difficult to determine the fair value based on the cyclicality of our business  demand for offshore drilling rigs in different markets and changes in economic conditions 
in connection with the merger  we acquired drilling contracts for future contract drilling services at fixed dayrates that may have been above or below market dayrates for similar contracts as of the date of the merger 
we adjusted these drilling contracts to fair value based on the discounted cash flow associated with each contract and the estimated market expectations for dayrates that could be charged over the same contractual terms 
the market for drilling contracts is limited  identifying comparable contract rates in the market and determining the fair value is subjective  and the assumptions used to estimate market value and the discounted cash flow associated with the contract can affect the assigned value 
these assumptions include differences in capabilities of rigs  cost differentials between locations for similar rigs  cost escalations or tax reimbursements that may or may not be included in the dayrate and assumptions about rig efficiency 
differences in estimated market values of the contracts could have a material impact on the amortization of the contract intangible recognized in contract intangible revenues on our consolidated statement of operations 
pension and other postretirement benefits our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit retiree life insurance and medical benefits obligations and the related benefit costs are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas  sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
pension and postretirement costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
we evaluate our assumptions periodically and make adjustments to these assumptions and the recorded liabilities as necessary 
two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
we periodically evaluate our assumptions regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and future expectations on investment returns  which are calculated by our third party investment advisor utilizing the asset allocation classes held by the plans portfolios 
as of january   based on market conditions and investment strategies  we did not change our expected long term rate of return for our us plans of percent 
for determining the discount rate for our us plans  we utilize a yield curve approach based on aa corporate bonds and the expected timing of future benefit payments 
changes in these and other assumptions used in the actuarial computations could impact our projected benefit obligations  pension liabilities  pension expense and other comprehensive income 
we base our determination of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets that reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
for each percentage point the expected long term rate of return assumption is lowered  pension expense would increase by approximately million 
for each one half percentage point the discount rate is lowered  pension expense would increase by approximately million 
see retirement plans and other postemployment benefits 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to litigation  personal injury claims and potential tax assessments see income taxes 
revisions to contingent liability reserves are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss change 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required and would be recognized in the period the new information becomes known 
the estimation of the liability for personal injury claims includes the application of a loss development factor to reserves for known claims in order to estimate our ultimate liability for claims incurred during the period 
the loss development method is based on the assumption that historical patterns of loss development will continue in the future 
actual losses may vary from the estimates computed with these reserve development factors as they are dependent upon future contingent events such as court decisions and settlements 
retirement plans and other postemployment benefits defined benefit pension plans we maintain two qualified defined benefit pension plans  one of which we assumed in connection with the merger the retirement plans  covering substantially all us employees 
we also maintain two unfunded plans the supplemental benefit plans  one of which we assumed in connection with the merger along with two additional unfunded benefit plans the other supplemental benefit plans 
one of the other supplemental benefit plans provides certain eligible employees with benefits in excess of those allowed under the retirement plans and the other provides benefits to eligible non us employees 
we assumed three defined benefit pension plans two funded and one unfunded in connection with the r b falcon merger and one unfunded defined benefit plan in connection with the merger the frozen plans  all of which were frozen prior to the respective mergers and for which benefits no longer accrue but the pension obligations have not been fully distributed 
we refer to the retirement plans  the supplemental benefit plans  the other supplemental benefit plans and the frozen plans  collectively  as the us plans 
effective january   we merged the two retirement plans into a single qualified defined benefit pension plan  and we combined the two supplemental benefit plans into a single supplemental benefit plan 
in connection with the merger  we amended the supplemental benefit plans to provide employees terminated under a severance plan with age  earnings and service benefits severance credits described in the severance plan  as defined below  and similar severance arrangements 
the supplemental benefit plans provide severance credits for the period of time following termination during which severance is paid the salary continuation period 
alternatively  to provide the value of the severance credits to an eligible employee who receives severance in a lump sum  the severance credits are granted for the period of time over which the lump sum would have been paid had it been paid as salary continuation the severance continuation period equivalent 
the amended supplemental benefit plans also provide for a lump sum form of payment within days after a participant s termination of employment and a six month delay on benefits payable to specified employees under section a of the internal revenue code 
in connection with the merger  we also assumed a defined benefit plan in the uk the uk plan covering certain current and former legacy globalsantafe employees in the uk in addition  we provide several defined benefit plans  primarily group pension schemes with life insurance companies covering our norway operations and two unfunded plans covering certain of our employees and former employees the norway plans 
our contributions to the norway plans are determined primarily by the respective life insurance companies based on the terms of the plan 
for the insurance based plans  annual premium payments are considered to represent a reasonable approximation of the service costs of benefits earned during the period 
we also have unfunded defined benefit plans the other plans that provide retirement and severance benefits for certain of our indonesian  nigerian and egyptian employees 
the benefits we provide under defined benefit pension plans are comprised of the us plans  the norway plans  the other plans and the uk plan collectively  the transocean plans 
we account for the transocean plans in accordance with sfas  as amended by sfas these accounting standards require us to calculate our pension expense and liabilities using assumptions based on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility using actuarial assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
in accordance with sfas  changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in the statement of operations but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants 
two of the most critical assumptions used in calculating our pension expense and liabilities are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets for funded us plans was percent and percent as of december  and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was developed by reviewing each plan s target asset allocation and asset class long term rate of return expectations 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate 
for the us plans  we discounted our future pension obligations using a rate of percent at december  and percent at december  we expect pension expense related to the transocean plans for to increase by approximately million primarily due to the significant decline in the aggregate fair value of plan assets held by the trust  partly offset by a change in the demographic assumptions for future periods and plan asset growth realized in future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future

c weighted average based on relative average fair value of plan assets for the year 
for the funded us plans  our funding policy consists of reviewing the funded status of these plans annually and contributing an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
employer contributions to the funded us plans are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes 
we contributed million and million to the funded us plans during and  respectively 
we contributed less than million to the unfunded us plans during each of and to fund benefit payments 
our contributions to the transocean plans in and were funded from our cash flows from operations 
plan assets of the funded transocean plans have been unfavorably impacted by a decline in world equity markets during  given the allocation of approximately percent of plan assets to equity securities 
to a lesser extent  debt securities and other investments also experienced decreased values 
during  the market value of the investments in the transocean plans decreased by million  or percent  which is due to net investment losses of million  primarily in the funded us plans  resulting from the unfavorable performance of equity markets in  benefit plan payments of million and million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the transocean plans made employee contributions of million and participants contributed million in we expect to contribute million to the transocean plans in these contributions are comprised of an estimated million to meet minimum funding requirements for the funded us plans  million to fund expected benefit payments for the unfunded us plans and other plans  million for the funded norway plans and million for the uk plan 
we expect to fund the required contributions with cash flow from operations 
the following pension benefits payments are expected to be paid by the transocean plans in millions years ending december  postretirement benefits other than pensions we have several unfunded contributory and noncontributory other postretirement employee benefits opeb plans  including one that we assumed in connection with the merger  covering substantially all of our us employees 
funding of benefit payments for plan participants will be made as costs are incurred 
net periodic benefit cost for these other postretirement plans and their components  including service cost  interest cost  amortization of prior service cost and recognized net actuarial losses were million and less than million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the postretirement benefits payments are expected to be approximately million in each of  and off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  related party transactions pacific drilling limited we hold a percent equity interest in tpdi  a british virgin islands joint venture company formed by us and pacific drilling  a liberian company  to own two ultra deepwater drillships to be named dhirubhai deepwater kg and dhirubhai deepwater kg  which are currently under construction 
beginning on october   pacific drilling will have the right to exchange its interest in the joint venture for our shares or cash at a purchase price based on an appraisal of the fair value of the drillships  subject to various adjustments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term and short term debt 
the table below presents scheduled debt maturities in us dollars and related weighted average interest rates for each of the years ended december relating to debt obligations as of december  in millions  except interest rate percentages scheduled maturity date a b fair value thereafter total total debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate a maturity dates of the face value of our debt assume the put options on the series a notes  the series b notes and the series c notes will be exercised in december  december and december  respectively 
b expected maturity amounts are based on the face value of debt 
at december   we had approximately billion of variable rate debt at face value percent of total debt at face value 
this variable rate debt primarily represented issuances outstanding under the program and borrowings under the term loan 
at december   we had approximately billion of variable debt outstanding represented by the floating rate notes and borrowings under the bridge loan facility and the former day revolving credit facility 
based upon the december  and variable rate debt outstanding amounts  a one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a corresponding change in interest expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  a large part of our cash investments would earn commensurately higher rates of return if interest rates increase 
using december  and cash investment levels  a one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a corresponding change in interest income of approximately million and million per year  respectively 
the fair market value of our debt at december  was billion compared to billion at december  the decrease in fair value of billion was primarily due to the repayment of debt during the year  as well as changes in the corporate bond market 
in connection with the merger  we acquired gsf jack ryan  which is subject to a fully defeased financing lease arrangement with a remaining term of years 
as a result  we have assumed the rights and obligations under the terms of the defeasance arrangement executed by globalsantafe with three financial institutions  whereby we are required to make additional payments if the defeasance deposit does not earn a rate of return of at least percent per year  the interest rate expected at the inception of the agreement 
the defeasance deposit earns interest based on the british pound three month libor  which was percent as of december  if the interest rate were to remain fixed at this rate for the next five years  we would be required to make an additional payment of approximately million during that period 
we do not expect that  if required  any additional payments made under this defeasance arrangement would be material to our statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign exchange risk our international operations expose us to foreign exchange risk 
we use a variety of techniques to minimize the exposure to foreign exchange risk  including customer contract payment terms and the possible use of foreign exchange derivative instruments 
our primary foreign exchange risk management strategy involves structuring customer contracts to provide for payment in both us dollars  which is our functional currency  and local currency 
the payment portion denominated in local currency is based on anticipated local currency requirements over the contract term 
due to various factors  including customer acceptance  local banking laws  other statutory requirements  local currency convertibility and the impact of inflation on local costs  actual foreign exchange needs may vary from those anticipated in the customer contracts  resulting in partial exposure to foreign exchange risk 
fluctuations in foreign currencies typically have not had a material impact on our overall results 
in situations where payments of local currency do not equal local currency requirements  foreign exchange derivative instruments  specifically foreign exchange forward contracts  or spot purchases  may be used to mitigate foreign currency risk 
a foreign exchange forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   we had no open foreign exchange derivative contracts
