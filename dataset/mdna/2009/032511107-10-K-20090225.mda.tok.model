operating results segment analysis adjusted ebitdax to assess the operating results of anadarko s segments  management uses income from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense  exploration expense  dd a expense and impairments adjusted ebitdax 
anadarko s definition of adjusted ebitdax  which is not a gaap measure  excludes exploration expense  as exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period  but is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities 
similarly  dd a expense and impairments are excluded from adjusted ebitdax as a measure of segment operating performance  because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred 
the company s definition of adjusted ebitdax also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to anadarko s financing methods or capital structure 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitdax provides information useful in assessing the company s financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitdax is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make distributions to shareholders 
adjusted ebitdax  as defined by anadarko  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  anadarko s consolidated adjusted ebitdax should be considered in conjunction with income from continuing operations and other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap  such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations and net cash

western transaction on august   anadarko completed the acquisition of western for billion  or per share  plus the assumption of million of debt 
western s cbm properties within the powder river basin are directly adjacent to anadarko s assets in this developing play 
anadarko believes that combining its properties with western s accelerated the development of these natural gas resources and will produce volume growth through the end of the decade  and possibly longer  with more than  identified drilling locations in inventory 
the acquisition of western also significantly increased the company s holdings in gathering and processing systems 
divestitures as a result of a portfolio refocusing effort stemming from the acquisitions of kerr mcgee and western  anadarko divested certain properties during and for approximately billion before income taxes

the closing of this transaction was subject to customary closing conditions  including receipt of approvals by venezuelan authorities 
anadarko has been informed by the venezuelan ministry of energy and petroleum that it will not grant approval of the sale transaction because pdvsa intends to acquire anadarko s equity interest in petroritupano 
anadarko has subsequently received a letter from corporacion venezolana del petroleo  sa cvp  an affiliate of pdvsa  in which cvp states its interest in acquiring anadarko s equity interest in petroritupano 
at this time  anadarko is unable to determine when the sale to cvp may be consummated 
anadarko s investment in petroritupano is included in other assets at december  for additional information  see note acquisitions  divestitures and other under item of this form k 
proved reserves anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is a key to growth 
future profitability depends partially upon the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves  among other factors 
reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling  improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties 
in conjunction with the august acquisition of kerr mcgee and western  anadarko implemented an asset realignment program 
the goal of the kerr mcgee and western acquisitions was to provide a more economically efficient platform with higher and more consistent growth potential  with the intent of divesting properties that were no longer deemed to be core to anadarko s operations 
during  the company successfully completed the majority of the divestiture stage of the realignment program 
as expected  anadarko s proved reserves at the end of were about equal to levels before the acquisitions 
the following discussion of proved reserves  reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves includes both continuing and discontinued operations 
a breakdown of reserve information by continuing and discontinued operations is contained in the supplemental information under item of this form k 
mmboe proved reserves beginning of year reserve additions and revisions sales in place production end of year proved developed reserves beginning of year end of year the company s proved natural gas reserves at year end were tcf compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end anadarko s proved crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves at year end were billion barrels compared to billion barrels at year end and billion barrels at year end crude oil  condensate and ngls comprised about  and of the company s proved reserves at year end  and respectively 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by the company s engineers  are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
the available data reviewed include  among other things  seismic data  structure and isopach maps  well logs  production tests  material balance calculations  reservoir simulation models  reservoir pressures  individual well and field performance data  individual well and field projections  offset performance data  operating expenses  capital costs and product prices 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions  as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with infill drilling 
sustained decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner 
reserve additions and revisions during  the company added mmboe of proved reserves as a result of additions purchases in place  discoveries  improved recovery and extensions and revisions 
the company expects the majority of future reserve adds to come from positive revisions associated with infill drilling and extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in north america and the deepwaters of the gulf of mexico  as well as through improved recovery operations  purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas 
the success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future 
additions during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves primarily as the result of successful drilling in the rockies and developments and appraisals in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves 
of this amount  mmboe were as a result of successful drilling in cbm and conventional plays of the rockies and the initial recognition of proved reserves at the peregrino field in brazil 
during  anadarko added  mmboe of proved reserves 
of this amount   mmboe were related to purchases in place primarily associated with the acquisitions of kerr mcgee and western in august in addition  the company added mmboe of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in core areas onshore in the united states 
revisions total revisions in were mmboe or of the beginning of year reserve base 
the revisions included an increase of mmboe primarily related to the large onshore natural gas plays  such as the greater natural buttes  wattenberg and pinedale fields  as a result of successful infill drilling  in addition to positive revisions to the peregrino heavy oil field  offshore brazil  which was sold in  partially offset by a decrease of mmboe related to prices for oil and ngls 
total revisions for were mmboe 
revisions in related primarily to the large onshore natural gas plays such as greater natural buttes  wattenberg  and pinedale and jonah fields  where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as a positive revision  and the increase in oil and natural gas prices 
total revisions for were mmboe 
revisions in related primarily to performance revisions of mmboe mainly due to downward revisions of the company s reserves at the k complex in the gulf of mexico and adjustments in algeria  and price revisions of mmboe primarily due to a significant decrease in natural gas prices since the end of  partially offset by additional infill drilling reserve bookings of mmboe 
sales in place during  the company sold properties located in the united states and brazil representing mmboe and mmboe of proved reserves  respectively 
in  the company sold properties located in the united states and qatar representing mmboe and mmboe of proved reserves  respectively 
in  the company sold properties located in canada representing mmboe of proved reserves 
in addition  sales in place included mmboe of proved reserves related to government imposed contract changes which resulted in the company s venezuelan properties being exchanged for an equity interest in a new venezuela operating entity 
future net cash flows at december   the present value discounted at of future net cash flows from anadarko s proved reserves was billion stated in accordance with the regulations of the sec and the financial accounting standards board fasb 
this present value was calculated based on prices at year end 
table of contents 
index to financial statements held flat for the life of the reserves  adjusted for any contractual provisions 
the decrease of billion or in compared to is primarily due to lower commodity prices at year end see supplemental information under item of this form k 
the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
midstream strategies anadarko invests in midstream gathering  treating and processing facilities to complement its oil and gas operations in regions where the company has natural gas production 
the company is better able to control the timing of development of its oil and gas properties and manage both the value received for  and cost of  gathering  treating and processing natural gas through its ownership and operation of these facilities 
in addition  anadarko s midstream business provides gathering  treating and processing services for third party customers  including major and independent producers 
anadarko generates revenues in its gathering and processing activities through various fee structures that include fixed rate  percent of proceeds  or keep whole agreements 
the company also processes a portion of its gas at various third party plants 
in  anadarko significantly increased the size and scope of its midstream business through the acquisitions of western and kerr mcgee 
anadarko has systems in seven states wyoming  colorado  utah  new mexico  kansas  oklahoma and texas located in major producing basins of the onshore united states 
in december  a midstream subsidiary issued a billion note payable to a related party

wes is a delaware limited partnership formed by anadarko to own  operate  acquire and develop midstream assets 
anadarko contributed assets to wes in exchange for an aggregate limited partner interest consisting of common and subordinated limited partner units in wes  a general partner interest and idrs 
idrs entitle the holder to specified increasing percentages of cash distributions as wes s per unit cash distributions increase 
in addition  anadarko maintains control over the assets owned by wes through sole indirect ownership of the general partner interests 
proceeds from the initial public offering were used to reduce debt 
on december   wes acquired additional midstream assets from anadarko for aggregate consideration of million  consisting of a million note payable to anadarko and the issuance of million common units of wes to anadarko 
in addition  wes issued additional general partner units to its general partner  a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko  to allow it to maintain its general partner interest in wes after contribution by anadarko of its undivided interest in the midstream assets 
anadarko currently holds an aggregate limited partner interest in wes 
marketing strategies the company s marketing department actively manages sales of its natural gas  crude oil and ngls 
the company s sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale 
in  the company also engaged in sales of greenhouse gas ercs derived from co 

injection operations in wyoming 
the company expects additional sales of ercs in the future 
the company also purchases natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near anadarko s production 
these purchases allow anadarko to aggregate larger volumes  fully utilize transportation capacity  attract larger  creditworthy customers and facilitate its efforts to maximize prices received for the company s production and minimize balancing issues with customers and pipelines during operational disruptions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
the company does not engage in market making practices and limits its trading activities to natural gas  crude oil and ngls commodity contracts 
the company s trading risk position  typically  is a net short position that is offset by the company s natural long position as a producer 
see energy price risk under item a of this form k 
in an effort to protect the company from commodity price risk stemming from the acquisitions  the company entered into derivatives covering and of the acquired companies then expected production volumes for and  respectively 
this price risk management program employed collars and other derivatives intended to help ensure a return on investment while maintaining upside potential that could result from higher commodity prices 
in the past year  almost all segments of the global economy have experienced a downturn 
this downturn  along with the commodity price volatility  have made the creditworthiness  liquidity and financial position of the company s counterparties increasingly difficult to evaluate 
for this reason  the company has placed an increased emphasis on the monitoring of counterparty risk 
although anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third parties  in certain situations the company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases 
natural gas natural gas continues to fulfill a significant portion of north america s energy needs and the company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue 
natural gas prices have varied over the last year  with the first three quarters of the year averaging higher than corresponding quarters in and a year on year decrease in the last quarter of price volatility persists due to an increase in supply stemming principally from unconventional gas coupled with a decrease in domestic industrial demand 
anadarko markets its natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets 
anadarko energy services company  a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko  is a marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing  risk management and other services tailored to its customers needs 
the company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
the company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
the company owns a significant amount of natural gas firm transportation capacity that is used to help ensure access to downstream markets which increases the ability to produce the company s natural gas 
this transportation capacity also provides the opportunity to capture incremental value when pricing differentials between physical locations occur 
the company also stores some of its purchased natural gas in contracted storage facilities with the intent of selling the gas at a higher price in the future 
normally  the company will have forward contracts in place physical delivery or financial derivative instruments to sell the stored gas at a fixed price 
the company also utilizes these storage facilities to minimize operational disruptions to its ongoing operations 
crude oil  condensate and ngls anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls revenues are derived from production in the united states us  algeria  china and other international areas 
most of the company s us crude oil and ngls production is sold under contracts with prices based on market indices  adjusted for location  quality and transportation 
oil from algeria is sold by tanker as saharan blend to customers primarily in the mediterranean area 
saharan blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products such as jet and diesel fuel 
oil from china is sold by tanker as cao fei dian cfd blend to customers primarily in the far east markets 
cfd blend is a heavy sour crude oil which is sold into both the prime fuels refining market and the heavy fuel oil blend stock market 
the company also purchases and sells third party produced crude oil  condensate and ngls in the company s domestic and international market areas 
included in this strategy is the use of contracted ngls storage facilities 
the company utilizes this storage to capture market opportunities and to help minimize fractionation and downstream infrastructure disruptions

the downturn in the global economy  along with the turmoil in the financial markets and reduced availability to capital  have increased the importance of maintaining ample liquidity 
the pace with which the downturn has occurred made the evaluation of the company s lenders creditworthiness  liquidity and financial position increasingly difficult 
for this reason  the company has increased its diligence in monitoring its lenders funding capabilities 
the company has in place a billion rca and as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under its rca 
the company may choose to refinance certain portions of its short term borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets 
to facilitate such financings  the company may sell securities under its shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september the company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules 
the company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including property divestitures and additional borrowings  to secure funds when needed 
following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows during the period 
forward looking information related to the company s liquidity and capital resources are discussed in outlook that follows 
sources of cash cash flow from operating activities anadarko s cash flow from continuing operating activities in was billion compared to billion in and billion in the increase in cash flow was attributed to higher commodity prices and lower estimated income tax payments in compared to primarily related to the divestitures  partially offset by the effect of lower sales volumes primarily associated with the divestitures  and realized derivative losses in the decrease in cash flow from continuing operations compared to was attributed to the impact of income taxes on divestitures and higher costs and expenses  partially offset by the impact of higher sales volumes associated with the acquisitions 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the company s short term changes in cash flow from operating activities 
anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk 
sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short term  but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in prior years 
anadarko s long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices  reserve replacement  the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations and the level of acquisition and divestiture activity 
divestitures in  anadarko received proceeds of billion from divestitures of certain oil and gas properties primarily in brazil  onshore in the united states and the gulf of mexico 
proceeds from divestitures in were used to reduce debt

margin deposits the company is required to provide margin deposits whenever its unrealized losses on derivative transactions with a counterparty exceed predetermined credit limits  and in some cases only until negotiated maximum limits are reached 
both exchange and over the counter traded derivative instruments may be subject to margin deposit requirements 
given the company s price risk management position and price volatility  the company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these deposit requirements 
the company manages its exposure to margin requirements through negotiated credit arrangements with counterparties  which may include collateral caps 
if credit thresholds are exceeded  the company utilizes available cash or letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and maintains ample available committed credit facilities to meet its obligations

over the past three years  anadarko has entered into several agreements to secure the necessary drilling rigs to execute its drilling strategy over several years 
a previous review of the company s worldwide deepwater drilling inventory  along with the tightening deepwater and onshore rig market experienced in prior years  led anadarko to secure the drilling rigs it needs to execute its strategy 
the company believes these rig contracting efforts offer compelling economics and facilitate its drilling strategy

index to financial statements critical accounting estimates in preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to determination of properties and equipment  proved reserves  goodwill  asset retirement obligations  litigation  environmental liabilities  pension liabilities and costs  income taxes and fair values 
changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
management considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
oil and gas activities anadarko uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas activities 
under this method  acquisition costs and the costs associated with drilling exploratory well costs are capitalized pending the determination of proved oil and gas reserves 
geological and geophysical costs and other costs of carrying properties such as delay rentals are expensed as incurred 
acquisition costs acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent associated with successful exploration activities 
significant undeveloped leases are assessed periodically for impairment individually  based on the company s current exploration plans  and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated 
for unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs  costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease terms at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon expiration 
costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance  while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases are included in exploration expense 
significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play for example  greater natural buttes area in the rocky mountain region  while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have had limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area 
a majority of the company s unproved leasehold costs are associated with properties acquired in the kerr mcgee and western acquisitions in and to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed 
generally  economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests  but may be confirmed by the company s continuing exploitation program 
ultimate recovery of potentially recoverable reserves in areas with established production generally has greater likelihood than in areas with limited or no prior drilling activity 
another portion of the company s unproved leasehold costs are associated with the land grant acreage  where the company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to continue to explore and evaluate the acreage 
a change in the company s expected future plans for exploration and development could cause a write down in the company s unproved property 
exploratory costs under the successful efforts method of accounting  exploratory costs associated with a discovery well are initially capitalized  or suspended  pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling 
at the end of each quarter  management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular  whether the company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or  in the case of discoveries requiring government 
table of contents 
index to financial statements sanctioning  whether development negotiations are under way and proceeding as planned 
if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur  associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed 
therefore  at any point in time  the company may have capitalized costs on its consolidated balance sheet associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in a future period 
at december   suspended exploratory drilling costs were million compared to million at december  proved reserves anadarko estimates proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the sec and the fasb 
this definition includes crude oil  natural gas  and ngls which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions  as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with infill drilling 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier 
a material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on dd a expense and impairment expense 
in december  the sec released the final rule for modernization 
the modernization disclosure requirements will permit reporting of oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices and the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves  if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserves volumes 
companies will also be allowed to disclose probable and possible reserves in sec filed documents 
in addition  companies will be required to report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conduct a reserves audit 
the modernization disclosure requirements become effective for anadarko s annual report on form k for the year ended december  the sec is coordinating with the fasb to obtain the revisions necessary to provide consistency with the modernization 
in the event that consistency is not achieved in time for companies to comply with the modernization  the sec will consider delaying the compliance date 
a significant change as a result of the modernization rule relates to the calculation of reserves 
currently  reserves are calculated on a single day year end price 
under the modernization rule  reserves will be calculated on an average price which will reduce the volatility volatility as demonstrated in of the reserve calculation 
fair value the company estimates fair value for the measurement of derivatives  long lived assets during certain impairment tests  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing  certain exchanges  guarantees  and the initial measurement of an aro 
when the company is required to measure fair value  and there is not a market observable price for the asset or liability  or a market observable price for a similar asset or liability  the company generally utilizes an income valuation approach 
this approach utilizes management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows  and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk adjusted discount rate 
such evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on expected future events or conditions  such as sales prices  estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput  development and operating costs and the timing thereof  economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
the company s estimates of future net cash flows are inherently imprecise because they reflect management s expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management s control 
however  assumptions used reflect a market participant s view of long term prices  costs and other factors  and are consistent with assumptions used in the company s business plans and investment decisions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements business combinations accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
purchase price allocation the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company s assets and liabilities and carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost 
goodwill at december   the company had billion of goodwill recorded related to past business combinations 
this goodwill is not amortized  but is required to be assessed for impairment annually  or more often as facts and circumstances warrant 
the first step of that process is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill 
the reporting units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined from the manner in which the business is managed 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 
anadarko has allocated goodwill to three reporting units 
these reporting units are oil and gas exploration and production  gathering and processing  and transportation 
goodwill is tested annually on january the company completed its january  annual goodwill impairment tests with no impairment indicated 
as a result of general economic conditions  declines in commodity prices  and declines in its market capitalization compared to the book value of its stockholders equity during the fourth quarter of  the company determined an interim impairment test as of december  was appropriate 
the results of this interim goodwill impairment test also resulted in no impairment indicated 
anadarko considered its conclusions in light of its year end market capitalization being approximately below the book value of its stockholders equity  and concluded the assessment that no impairment was appropriate when considering that the market value for one share of anadarko common stock does not consider any premium that might be paid by a buyer who would obtain control of anadarko s entire oil and gas  gathering and processing  or transportation reporting units 
although anadarko cannot predict when or if goodwill will be impaired in the future  impairment charges may occur if the company is unable to replace the value of its depleting asset base or if other adverse events for example  lower sustained oil and gas prices reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit 
because quoted market prices for the company s reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test 
management uses all available information to make these fair value estimates  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit and market multiples of ebitdax for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units 
in estimating fair value of its oil and gas reporting unit  the company assumed production profiles utilized in its year end estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the company s supplemental oil and gas disclosures  market prices considering the forward price curve for oil and gas  adjusted for location and quality differentials that the company currently receives  as well as capital and operating costs consistent with year end pricing  adjusted for management s view that such costs should decline in the near term to realign with lower commodity prices  and discount rates that management believes a market participant would utilize to consider the risks inherent in anadarko s operations 
for the company s midstream reporting units  the company estimated fair value based on an estimated multiple of projected earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the company 
table of contents 
index to financial statements considered the relatively few transactions in the market  as well as trading multiples for peers to determine an appropriate multiple to apply against the company s projected ebitda for its gathering and processing and transportation reporting units 
a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment 
examples of factors that could cause a lower fair value estimate could be sustained declines in prices  increases in costs  and changes in discount rate assumptions due to market conditions 
impairment of assets a long lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may be greater than its future net cash flows 
impairment loss  if any  is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over the asset s estimated fair value 
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes  prices and costs  considering all available information at the date of the impairment review 
derivative instruments all derivative instruments  other than those that meet specific exclusions  are recorded at fair value 
if market quotes are not available to estimate fair value  management s best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or utilizing industry standard valuation techniques 
the company s derivative instruments are either exchange traded or transacted in an over the counter market 
valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data 
option fair values are measured using the black scholes merton option pricing model and verified by comparing a sample to market quotes for similar options if available 
unrealized gains or losses on derivatives are recorded within anadarko s current earnings 
benefit plan obligations the company has non contributory defined benefit pension plans  including both qualified and supplemental plans  and a foreign contributory defined benefit pension plan 
the company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
determination of the projected benefit obligations for the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans is important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement 
this also impacts the company s decisions for amounts contributed into the plans 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions  the most significant of which relate to discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of future increases in compensation levels  and health care cost projections 
anadarko develops demographics and utilizes the work of third party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations 
discount rate the discount rate assumption used by the company is meant to reflect the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date 
the company currently uses a yield curve analysis  for a majority of the plans  to support the discount rate assumption 
this analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high quality  non callable  marketable bonds  then discounts the projected cash flows from each plan at interest rates on the created curve specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present values of the cash flows are then accumulated  and a weighted average discount rate is calculated by imputing the single discount rate that equates to the total present value of the cash flows 
the consolidated discount rate assumption is determined by evaluation of the weighted average discount rates determined for each of the company s significant pension and postretirement plans 
the weighted average discount rate assumption used by the company as of december  was for pension plans and other postretirement plans 

table of contents 
index to financial statements expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption was determined using the year end pension investment balances by category and projected target asset allocations for the expected return for each of these categories was determined by using capital market projections  with consideration of actual five year performance statistics for investments in place 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption used by the company as of december  was 
rate of compensation increases the company determines this assumption based on its long term plans for compensation increases specific to employee groups covered and expected economic conditions 
the assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases  promotions and general inflation 
the weighted average rate of increase in long term compensation levels assumption used by the company as of december  was 
health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for  decreasing gradually to in and later years 
environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change the company s estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  or changes in their interpretation or administration  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the company s estimates 
the company s in house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and  in certain circumstances  outside legal counsel or consultants are utilized 
income taxes the amount of income taxes recorded by the company requires the interpretation of complex rules and regulations of various taxing jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
the company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and  if required  establishes accruals for such amounts 
the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by company management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances 
although company management believes its tax accruals are adequate  material changes in these accruals may occur in the future  based on the progress of ongoing tax audits  changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters
