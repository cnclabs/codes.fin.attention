item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview general we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on february   primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased industrial and commercial real property and selectively making long term industrial and commercial mortgage loans 
most of the portfolio of real estate we currently own is leased to a wide cross section of tenants ranging from small businesses to large public companies  many of which are corporations that do not have publicly rated debt 
we have in the past entered into  and intend in the future to enter into  purchase agreements for real estate having triple net leases with terms of approximately to years and built in rental increases 
under a triple net lease  the tenant is required to pay all operating  maintenance and insurance costs and real estate taxes with respect to the leased property 
we are actively communicating with buyout funds  real estate brokers and other third parties to locate properties for potential acquisition or to provide mortgage financing in an effort to build our portfolio 
business environment the united states entered into a recession in december  and  as a result  conditions within the global credit markets and the us real estate credit markets in particular continue to experience historic levels of dislocation and stress 
the economic downturn and the disruptions in the capital markets have increased the cost of  and decreased our ability to obtain  new debt and equity capital 
the longer these conditions persist  the greater the probability that these factors could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
the current economic conditions also make it difficult to price and finance new investment opportunities on attractive terms 
we do not know when market conditions will stabilize  if adverse conditions will intensify or the full extent to which the disruptions will affect us 
continued weak economic conditions could adversely impact the financial condition of one or more of our tenants and therefore  could make a tenant bankruptcy and payment default on the related lease or loan more likely 
currently  all of our properties are fully leased and all of our tenants and our borrower are current and paying in accordance with their leases and loan  respectively 
in addition  no balloon payments are due under our mortgage notes payable until  and the million mortgage note that matures in has three annual extension options through our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon external financing 
our principal external financing sources generally include the issuance of equity securities  the issuance of long term mortgages secured by properties and borrowings under our line of credit 
recent market conditions have affected the trading price of our common stock 
on february   the closing market price of our common stock was  which represents a discount to our average stock price of during as a result  equity financing is not currently a viable alternative for us 
in addition  the market for long term mortgages has frozen as the collateralized mortgage backed securities  or cmbs  market has disappeared 
with the recent closure of the cmbs market  many banks are not lending on commercial real estate as they are no longer able to sell these loans to the cmbs market and many banks are not willing or able to keep these loans on their balance sheets 
we are now seeing banks only willing to issue medium term mortgages  between to years  at substantially less favorable terms 
as a result  we intend to focus on medium term mortgages until the market for long term mortgages returns 
our ability to increase the availability under our line of credit is dependent upon us pledging additional properties as collateral 
traditionally  we have pledged new properties to the line of credit as we arrange for long term mortgages for these pledged properties 
currently  only of our properties do not have long term mortgages  and of those are pledged as collateral under our line of credit 
our line of credit matures in december  however we intend to exercise our option to extend the term for an additional year  through december we expect that under current market conditions  debt and equity capital will be costly and difficult for us to access for some time 
as long as this is the case  our near term strategy has become somewhat dependent upon retaining capital and building the value of our existing portfolio of properties by reviewing and renegotiating existing leases and making capital improvements to our properties 
capital improvements will be limited to the extent we have available capital 
we will continue to review potential acquisitions and we intend to continue our strategy of making conservative investments in properties that have existing financing  and funding the remainder using the existing availability under our line of credit  that we believe will weather the current recession and that are likely to produce attractive long term returns for our stockholders 
recent events investment activities during the year ended december   we acquired six properties totaling approximately  square feet for approximately million  and made capital improvements to our properties located in newburyport  massachusetts  arlington  texas and duncan  south carolina for approximately million  resulting in a total investment of approximately million 
of the total investment  million was funded under our line of credit and the remaining million was funded under a long term note payable with ge commercial mortgage financial corporation  or ge  assumed in connection with an acquisition 
financing activities during the year ended december   we had net borrowings under our line of credit of approximately million with million outstanding at december  the proceeds from the line of credit were used to fund the six acquisitions during the year and to fund capital improvements to our properties located in newburyport  massachusetts  arlington  texas and duncan  south carolina 
in september  we borrowed approximately million pursuant to a long term note payable with ge  collateralized by security interests in of our properties 
the proceeds from the long term note payable were used to pay down the line of credit 
property classifications at december   we owned properties totaling approximately million square feet  and had one mortgage loan outstanding 
the total gross investment in these acquisitions  including the million mortgage loan investment  was approximately million at december  prior to december   we reported the aggregate number of properties we own based on the appraisals obtained in connection with the acquisition of our properties  which occasionally grouped two or more buildings together 
at december  we are reporting  and in future periods we will report  our aggregate number of properties based on the number of individual buildings 
below is a summary of the properties we owned as of the respective periods  using the new methodology as of total properties owned march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  our adviser and administrator gladstone management corporation  or our adviser  is led by a management team which has extensive experience in our lines of business 
our adviser is controlled by david gladstone  our chairman and chief executive officer 
mr 
gladstone is also the chairman and chief executive officer of our adviser 
terry lee brubaker  our vice chairman  chief operating officer  secretary and director  is a member of the board of directors of our adviser and its vice chairman and chief operating officer  george stelljes iii  our president  chief investment officer and director  is a member of the board of directors of our adviser and its president and chief investment officer 
our adviser also has a wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone administration  llc  or the administrator  which employs our chief financial officer  chief compliance officer  treasurer and their respective staffs 
our adviser and administrator also provide investment advisory and administrative services to our affiliates  gladstone capital corporation and gladstone investment corporation  both publicly traded business development companies  as well as gladstone land corporation  a private agricultural real estate company 
with the exception of our chief financial officer  all of our executive officers serve as either directors or executive officers  or both  of gladstone capital corporation and gladstone investment corporation 
in the future  our adviser may provide investment advisory and administrative services to other funds  both public and private  of which it is the sponsor 
investment advisory and administration agreements we have been externally managed pursuant to a contractual investment advisory arrangement with our adviser  under which our adviser has directly employed all of our personnel and paid its payroll  benefits  and general expenses directly 
our initial investment advisory agreement with our adviser  which we refer to as the initial advisory agreement  was in place from august  through december  on january   we entered into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement with our adviser  which we refer to as the amended advisory agreement  and an administration agreement  which we refer to as the administration agreement  with our administrator 
under the terms of the initial advisory agreement and the amended advisory agreement  we were and remain responsible for all expenses incurred for our direct benefit 
examples of these expenses include legal  accounting  interest on short term debt and mortgages  tax preparation  directors and officers insurance  stock transfer services  stockholder related fees  consulting and related fees 
in addition  we are also responsible for all fees charged by third parties that are directly related to our business  which may include real estate brokerage fees  mortgage placement fees  lease up fees and transaction structuring fees although we may be able to pass some or all of such fees on to our tenants and borrowers 
during the years ended december   and none of these expenses were incurred by us directly 
the actual amount of such fees that we incur in the future will depend largely upon the aggregate costs of the properties we acquire  the aggregate amount of mortgage loans we make and the extent to which we are able to shift the burden of such fees to our tenants and borrowers 
accordingly  the amount of these fees that we will pay in the future is not determinable at this time 
management services and fees under the amended advisory agreement the amended advisory agreement provides for an annual base management fee equal to of our total stockholders equity  less the recorded value of any preferred stock  and an incentive fee based on funds from operations  or ffo 
for purposes of calculating the incentive fee  ffo includes any realized capital gains and capital losses  less any distributions paid on preferred stock  but ffo does not include any unrealized capital gains or losses 
the incentive fee will reward our adviser if our quarterly ffo  before giving effect to any incentive fee pre incentive fee ffo  exceeds  or annualized  the hurdle rate of total stockholders equity  less the recorded value of any preferred stock 
our adviser will receive of the amount of the pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds the hurdle rate  but is less than of our pre incentive fee ffo 
our adviser will also receive an incentive fee of of the amount of our pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds 
the incentive fee may be reduced because of our line of credit covenant which limits distributions to our stockholders to of ffo 
in order to comply with this covenant  our board of directors accepted our adviser s offer to unconditionally  irrevocably and voluntarily waive a portion of the incentive fee for the years ended december  and  which allowed us to maintain the current level of distributions to our stockholders 
our adviser has indicated that it intends to continue to waive all or a portion of the incentive fee in order to support the current level of distributions to our stockholders  however  our adviser is not required to issue any waiver  in whole or in part 
administration agreement under the administration agreement  we pay separately for our allocable portion of our administrator s overhead expenses in performing its obligations including  but not limited to  rent for employees of our administrator  and our allocable portion of the salaries and benefits expenses of our chief financial officer  chief compliance officer  treasurer and their respective staffs 
our allocable portion of expenses is derived by multiplying our administrator s total expenses by the percentage of our total assets at the beginning of each quarter in comparison to the total assets of all companies managed by our adviser under similar agreements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to make judgments that are subjective in nature in order to make certain estimates and assumptions 
management relies on its experience  collects historical data and current market data  and analyzes this information in order to arrive at what it believes to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions or assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
in addition  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
a summary of all of our significant accounting policies is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
below is a summary of accounting polices involving estimates and assumptions that require complex  subjective or significant judgments in their application and that materially affect our results of operations 
allocation of purchase price when we acquire real estate  we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and liabilities  consisting of land  building  tenant improvements  long term debt and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases  the value of unamortized lease origination costs  the value of tenant relationships and the value of capital lease obligations  based in each case on their fair values 
management s estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg  discounted cash flow analysis 
factors considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which primarily range from to months  depending on specific local market conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases  including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
management also considers the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement  among other factors 
a change in any of the assumptions above  which are very subjective  could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the allocation of the purchase price directly affects the following in our consolidated financial statements the amount of acquisition costs allocated to the various tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet  the amounts allocated to the value of above market and below market lease values are amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the amounts allocated to all other tangible and intangible assets are amortized to depreciation or amortization expense 
thus changes in the purchase price allocation among our assets could have a material impact on our ffo  which is used by investors of reits to evaluate our operating performance  and the period of time that tangible and intangible assets are depreciated over varies greatly  and thus changes in the amounts allocated to these assets will have a direct impact on our results of operations 
intangible assets are generally amortized over the respective life of the leases  which normally range from to years  we depreciate our buildings over years  and land is not depreciated 
these differences in timing could have a material impact on our results of operations 
asset impairment evaluation we periodically review the carrying value of each property to determine if circumstances that indicate impairment in the carrying value of the investment exist or that depreciation periods should be modified 
in determining if impairment exists  management considers such factors as our tenants payment history  the financial condition of our tenants  including calculating the current leverage ratios of tenants  the likelihood of lease renewal  business conditions in the industry in which our tenants operate and whether the carrying value of our real estate has decreased 
if any of the factors above support the possibility of impairment  we prepare a projection of the undiscounted future cash flows  without interest charges  of the specific property and determine if the investment in such property is recoverable 
in preparing the projection of undiscounted future cash flows  we estimate the hold periods of the properties and cap rates using information we obtain from market comparability studies and other comparable sources 
if impairment is indicated  the carrying value of the property would be written down to its estimated fair value based on our best estimate of the property s discounted future cash flows 
any material changes to the estimates and assumptions used in this analysis could have a significant impact on our results of operations  as the changes would impact our determination of whether impairment is deemed to have occurred and the amount of impairment loss we would recognize 
using the methodology discussed above and in light of the current economic conditions discussed above in business environment  we performed an impairment analysis of our entire portfolio at december  we have concluded that none of our properties are currently impaired  and we will continue to monitor our portfolio for any indicators that may change our conclusion 
provision for loan losses our accounting policies require that we reflect in our financial statements an allowance for estimated credit losses with respect to mortgage loans we have made based upon our evaluation of known and inherent risks associated with our private lending assets 
management reflects provisions for loan losses based upon our assessment of general market conditions  our internal risk management policies and credit risk rating system  industry loss experience  our assessment of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults  and the value of the collateral underlying our investments 
any material changes to the estimates and assumptions used in this analysis could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we did not make a loss allowance for our existing mortgage loan receivable as of december   as we believe the carrying value of the loan is fully collectible 
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of all recently issued accounting pronouncements 
results of operations our weighted average yield on the portfolio was approximately  and as of december    and  respectively 
our weighted average yields on the six properties acquired during the year ended december  were as follows date acquired property location weighted average yield reading  pennsylvania fridley  minnesota concord township  ohio pineville  north carolina marietta  ohio chalfont  pennsylvania the weighted average yield on our portfolio is calculated by taking the annualized straight line rents  reflected as rental income on our consolidated statements of operations  or mortgage interest payments  reflected as interest income from mortgage notes receivable on our consolidated statements of operations  of each acquisition or mortgage loan as a percentage of the acquisition or loan price  as applicable 
the weighted average yield does not take into account the interest expense incurred on the financings placed on our properties 
a comparison of our operating results for the years ended december  and is below for the year ended december  change change operating revenues rental income interest income from mortgage notes receivable tenant recovery revenue total operating revenues operating expenses depreciation and amortization property operating expenses due diligence expense base management fee incentive fee administration fee professional fees insurance directors fees stockholder related expense asset retirement obligation expense general and administrative total operating expenses before credit from adviser credit to incentive fee total operating expenses other income expense interest income from temporary investments interest income employee loans other income interest expense total other expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations net realized income from foreign currency transactions taxes refunded on sale of real estate total discontinued operations net income distributions attributable to preferred stock net income available to common stockholders operating revenues rental income increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of the six properties acquired during  coupled with properties acquired during that were held for the full year in interest income from mortgage notes receivable decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily because interest income on our mortgage loan is based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor  which has significantly decreased over the past year 
tenant recovery revenue increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of the reimbursement of the ground lease payments on our tulsa  oklahoma property acquired in march  which was held for the entire year in  coupled with properties acquired during in which tenants reimbursed us for insurance expense 
operating expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   as a result of the six properties acquired during  and properties acquired during that were held for the full year in property operating expenses consist of franchise taxes  management fees  insurance  ground lease payments and overhead expenses paid on behalf of certain of our properties 
property operating expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to an increase in the amount of franchise taxes paid as a result of the properties acquired during in addition  property operating expenses included ground lease payments on our tulsa  oklahoma property acquired in march  which was held for the entire year in due diligence expense consists of fees incurred for acquisitions that did not close 
the fees primarily consist of legal fees and fees incurred for third party reports prepared during our due diligence work 
over million of the fees incurred were related to a large potential acquisition that did not close during  and is not expected to be pursued further in we anticipate with the adoption of sfas r  discussed in detail in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  that the amount of expense we incur during and future years will also increase  as we will no longer be able to capitalize due diligence costs into the price of the acquisition 
the base management fee decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   as a result of a decrease in total common stockholders equity  the main component of the calculation 
the calculation of the base management fee is described in detail above under investment advisory and administration agreements 
the incentive fee increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to the decrease in total common stockholders equity  coupled with the increase in ffo 
the calculation of the incentive fee is described in detail above under investment advisory and administration agreements 
the administration fee increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of the increased number of employees of our administrator  coupled with an increase in overhead expenses allocated by our administrator 
the calculation of the administrative fee is described in detail above under investment advisory and administration agreements 
professional fees  consisting primarily of legal and accounting fees  decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of a reduction in legal fees combined with fees incurred during the year ended december  for state tax research and costs related to the implementation of fin  which were not incurred during the year ended december  insurance expense consists of the premiums paid for directors and officers insurance  which is renewed annually each september 
insurance expense decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   because of a decrease in the premiums for the period from september through september premiums for directors and officers insurance increased approximately for the period from september through september and thus we expect this amount to increase in directors fees decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of fewer committee meetings occurring in the year ended december  coupled with one of the independent directors becoming an interested director in january  and thus the director no longer receiving fees for attending board meetings 
stockholder related expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of the increase in our costs associated with printing and filing the annual report  coupled with costs associated with the solicitation of the stockholder vote for the annual meeting

other income increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily because of a real estate tax reimbursement we received from our property located in sterling heights  michigan in interest expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this was primarily a result of the long term financings we closed on of our properties during  coupled with an increased amount outstanding on our line of credit during discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  is the expense related to our two canadian properties  which were sold in july the expense relates to legal fees associated with the dissolution of the entities which sold the properties 
the tax returns were filed in march  and we were due a refund of approximately  which is reflected on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations under taxes refunded on sale of real estate for the year ended december  net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of increased interest expense from the increased number of properties which have long term financing  partially offset by the increase in the size of our portfolio of investments in the past year and the corresponding increase in our revenues and the other events described above

there was no administration fee recorded during the year ended december   as the administration agreement was not in effect 
professional fees  consisting primarily of legal and accounting fees  decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of fees paid in connection with the formation of the massachusetts business trusts in  fees paid in connection with the audit of the modification to the stock option plan in  legal fees incurred in related to the defaulted mortgage loan on the sterling heights  michigan property  and lower audit fees paid in than  partially offset by an increase in accounting fees paid in related to the implementation of fin and increased tax return preparation fees associated with the increased number of states in which we were required to file tax returns 
insurance expense consists of the premiums paid for directors and officers insurance  which is renewed annually each september

there was no stock option compensation expense recorded for the year ended december  as we terminated our stock option plan on december  stock option compensation expense for the year ended december  was the result of the adoption of the sfas r revised share based payment 
other income and expense interest income from temporary investments increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of the increase in our average cash balances during the year ended december   as a result of long term financings on properties that closed subsequent to december  interest income on employee loans increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase was a result of employee loans that were originated during in which interest was earned for the full year in other income decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily because of income received from defaulted interest  expenses  and late penalties from the settlement on the defaulted mortgage loan on the sterling heights  michigan property in interest expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this was primarily a result of the long term financings we closed on properties in  partially offset by a decreased amount outstanding on our line of credit 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations relates to our two canadian properties  which were sold in july income for the year ended december  was a result of operations from the canadian properties held during that time  whereas the expense for the year ended december  was a result of expenses related to the entities that we incurred subsequent to the sale 
we also paid and fully accrued approximately  in taxes related to the gain on the sale in the tax returns were subsequently filed in march of  and the amount owed was approximately  we received a refund of approximately  in  which is reflected under taxes paid on sale of real estate 
net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of the gain on sale of the two canadian properties recognized in july of  coupled with increased interest expense from the increased number of properties which have long term financing and the preferred distributions paid 
this is partially offset by the increase in our portfolio of investments in the past year and the corresponding increase in our revenues and the other events described above  and the elimination of stock option expense during liquidity and capital resources future capital needs at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we have access to our existing line of credit with an available borrowing capacity of million  have obtained mortgages on of our properties and have a million short term loan 
we had investments in real properties for a net value  including intangible assets  of approximately million and one mortgage loan receivable for million 
as discussed in business environment above  continued weak economic conditions have adversely affected our ability to obtain additional mortgages  as well as our ability to borrow funds and issue equity securities  our principal sources of external financing 
until economic conditions improve  we intend to fund our existing contractual obligations with our cash flows from operations and borrowing against our existing line of credit 
when economic conditions improve  we intend to complete additional acquisitions of real estate and to originate additional mortgage notes 
when economic conditions improve  we intend to fund our contractual obligations and acquire additional properties by borrowing all or a portion of the purchase price and collateralizing the mortgages with some or all of our real property  by borrowing against our existing line of credit or by issuing additional equity securities under an effective shelf registration statement 
the registration statement permits us to issue  through one or more transactions  up to an aggregate of million in securities consisting of common or preferred stock  all of which was available as of december  we may also use these funds for general corporate needs 
if we are unable to make any required debt payments on any borrowings  our lenders could foreclose on the properties collateralizing their loans  which could cause us to lose part or all of our investments in such properties 
we do not have any balloon principal payments due under any of our long term mortgages until  and the million mortgage that matures in has three annual extension options through in addition  we need sufficient capital to fund our distributions  pay the debt service costs on our existing long term mortgages  repay our million short term loan and fund our current operating costs 
we may require credits to our management fees  issued from our adviser  in order to meet these obligations  although our adviser is under no obligation to provide such credits  in whole or in part 
we routinely review our liquidity requirements  and we believe that our current cash flows from operations  coupled with our current availability on our line of credit  are sufficient to continue operations  repay our short term loan and pay distributions to our stockholders  however we are unable to determine the terms of future borrowings or equity issuances or whether we will be able to borrow funds or issue equity on terms favorable to us  or at all 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily a result of the six properties we acquired during  coupled with the properties acquired during that were held for the full year in a majority of cash from operating activities is generated from the rental payments we receive from our tenants and the interest payments we receive from our borrower 
we utilize this cash to fund our property level operating expenses and use the excess cash primarily for debt and interest payments on our mortgage notes payable  interest payments on our line of credit and short term loan  distributions to our stockholders  management fees to our adviser  and other entity level expenses 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was approximately million  which primarily consisted of the purchase of six properties  as described in recent events above  as compared to net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  of approximately million  which primarily consisted of the purchase of properties and one leasehold interest 
during the year ended december   we purchased five of the six properties using borrowings under our line of credit and assumed the mortgage on the sixth property located in chalfont  pennsylvania 
during the year ended december   we purchased all of the properties using borrowings under our line of credit  and then subsequently placed long term mortgages on most of these properties and used the proceeds to pay down the line of credit 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  which primarily consisted of the proceeds from the long term financing of of our properties and borrowings under our line of credit  partially offset by repayments on our line of credit  principal repayments on mortgage notes payable  payments for deferred financing costs and distributions paid to our stockholders

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the primary risk that we believe we will be exposed to is interest rate risk 
we currently own one variable rate loan receivable  certain of our leases contain escalations based on market interest rates  and the interest rate on our existing line of credit and short term loan are variable 
although we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring such provisions of our loans and leases to contain a minimum interest rate or escalation rate  as applicable  these features do not eliminate this risk 
we are also exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of the holding of our cash and cash equivalents in short term  interest bearing investments 
we have not entered into any derivative contracts to attempt to further manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net income for the years ended december  and  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions beyond a minimum interest rate or escalation rate are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
the following table summarizes the impact of a increase and decrease in the one month libor for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase in the one month libor rental interest income interest expense net decrease net income available to common stockholders as reported net decrease as percentage of net income available to common stockholders as reported decrease in the one month libor rental interest income interest expense net increase net income available to common stockholders as reported net increase as percentage of net income available to common stockholders as reported as of december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt outstanding was approximately million 
interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments  using rates at december   had been one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
in the future  we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit  term loan or long term mortgage debt used to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and  in some cases  with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates 
we may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
in addition to changes in interest rates  the value of our real estate is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees  all of which may affect our ability to refinance debt if necessary
