the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the leading independent provider of enterprise data integration software 
we generate revenues from sales of software licenses for our enterprise data integration software products  including product upgrades that are not part of post contract services  and from sales of services  which consist of maintenance  consulting  and education services 
we receive revenues from licensing our products under perpetual licenses directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  distributors  and oems in the united states and internationally 
we also receive a small amount of revenues under subscription based licenses for on demand offerings from customers and partners 
we receive service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services  and education services that we perform for customers that license our products either directly or indirectly 
most of our international sales have been in europe  and revenues outside of europe and north america have comprised or less of total consolidated revenues during the past three years 
we license our software and provide services to many industry sectors  including  but not limited to  energy and utilities  financial services  insurance  government and public agencies  healthcare  high technology  manufacturing  retail  services  telecommunications  and transportation 
despite the turmoil in the financial markets  and recession in the united states and many foreign economies  we were able to grow our total revenues in by to million compared to million in license revenues increased year over year  primarily as a result of increases in the volume of our transactions  and growth in international revenues 
services revenues increased due to growth in maintenance revenues which is attributable to the increased size of our installed customer base 
additionally  broader use of our existing products and the increase in new license sales resulted in a increase in our training and consulting revenues 
since our revenues have grown at a faster pace than the increase in our operating expenses  our operating income as a percentage of revenues has grown from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in may  we acquired identity systems  inc identity  a provider of identity resolution technology 
incorporation of this technology extends our enterprise data integration platform to allow customers to perform real time searches for specific entities across very large data volumes and to resolve identity data accurately and quickly 
on february   the company acquired applimation  inc applimation  a private company incorporated in delaware  providing application information lifecycle management ilm technology 
the acquisition extends informatica s data integration software to include applimation s technology 

table of contents due to our dynamic market  we face both significant opportunities and challenges  and as such  we focus on the following key factors macroeconomic conditions during  the united states and many foreign economies have experienced significant adversity driven by varying concerns including those related to the turmoil in the credit markets and financial markets  concerns regarding the stability and viability of major financial institutions  the state of the housing and labor markets and volatility in fuel prices 
given the significance and widespread nature of the effects  the united states and global economies are in a recession and will remain challenged for some period in the future 
these adverse conditions  which are beyond our control  are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on our business 
competition inherent in our industry are risks arising from competition with existing software solutions  including solutions from ibm  oracle  and sap  technological advances from other vendors  and the perception of cost savings by solving data integration challenges through customer hand coding development resources 
our prospective customers may view these alternative solutions as more attractive than our offerings 
additionally  the consolidation activity in our industry including oracle s acquisition of bea systems  sunopsis and hyperion solutions  ibm s acquisition of datamirror and cognos  and sap s acquisition of business objects  which had previously acquired firstlogic could pose challenges as competitors market a broader suite of software products or solutions to our prospective customers 
new product introductions to address the expanding data integration and data integrity needs of our customers and prospective customers  we continue to introduce new products and technology enhancements on a regular basis 
in october  we delivered the generally available release of powercenter  powerexchange  and informatica data quality in june  we delivered a version upgrade to our entire data integration platform by delivering the generally available version of powercenter  powerexchange  and informatica data quality including identity resolution 
in november  we launched our on demand data synchronization service for salesforce 
com 
new product introductions and or enhancements have inherent risks including  but not limited to  product availability  product quality and interoperability  and customer adoption or the delay in customer purchases 
given the risks and new nature of the products  we cannot predict their impact on our overall sales and revenues 
quarterly and seasonal fluctuations historically  purchasing patterns in the software industry have followed quarterly and seasonal trends and are likely to do so in the future 
specifically  it is normal for us to recognize a substantial portion of our new license orders in the last month of each quarter and sometimes in the last few weeks of each quarter  though such fluctuations are mitigated somewhat by recognition of backlog orders 
in recent years  the fourth quarter has had the highest level of license revenue and order backlog  although the increase was less pronounced at the end of  and we have generally had weaker demand for our software products and services in the first and third quarters 
to address these potential risks  we have focused on a number of key initiatives  including certain cost containment measures  the strengthening of our partnerships  the broadening of our distribution capability worldwide  and the targeting of our sales force and distribution channel on new products 
we have reduced expenses in certain areas and have tempered our hiring plans 
in august  we implemented a one week shutdown of our operations 
instead of our traditional informatica world conference in  we have decided to host a more cost effective set of targeted events for our customers  partners  developers  and analysts 
we are concentrating on maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our existing strategic partners and building relationships with additional strategic partners 
these partners include systems integrators  resellers and distributors  and strategic technology partners  including enterprise application providers  database vendors  and enterprise information integration vendors  in the united states and internationally 
in february  we launched our new worldwide partner program  inform  which is comprised of a set of programs and services to help partners develop and promote solutions in conjunction with informatica 
in march  we announced that wipro technologies selected informatica data migration suite to power its data migration services 
we are partners with fast acquired by microsoft  sap  oracle  hyperion solutions acquired by oracle and salesforce 
com 
we have also recently partnered with nec 
see risk factors we rely on our relationships with our strategic partners 
if we do not maintain and strengthen these relationships  our ability to generate revenue and control expenses could be adversely affected  which could cause a decline in the price of our common stock in part i  item a 
we have broadened our distribution efforts  and we have continued to expand our sales both in terms of selling data warehouse products to the enterprise level and of selling more strategic data integration solutions beyond data warehousing  including data quality  data migrations  data consolidations  data synchronizations  data hubs  and cross enterprise data integration to our customers 
table of contents enterprise architects and chief information officers 
we have expanded our international sales presence in recent years by opening new offices  increasing headcount  and through acquisitions 
as a result of this international expansion  as well as the increase in our direct sales headcount in the united states  our sales and marketing expenses have increased 
in the long term  we expect these investments to result in increased revenues and productivity and ultimately higher profitability 
however  if we experience an increase in sales personnel turnover  do not achieve expected increases in our sales pipeline  experience a decline in our sales pipeline conversion ratio  or do not achieve increases in sales productivity and efficiencies from our new sales personnel as they gain more experience  then it is unlikely that we will achieve our expected increases in revenue  sales productivity  or profitability 
we have experienced some increases in revenues and sales productivity in the united states in the past few years 
during the past year  we have also experienced increases in revenues internationally  but we have not yet achieved the same level of sales productivity internationally as domestically 
to address the risks of introducing new products  we have continued to invest in programs to help train our internal sales force and our external distribution channel on new product functionalities  key differentiations  and key business values 
these programs include user conferences for customers and partners  our annual sales kickoff conference for all sales and key marketing personnel in january  webinars for our direct sales force and indirect distribution channel  in person technical seminars for our pre sales consultants  the building of product demonstrations  and creation and distribution of targeted marketing collateral 
we have also invested in partner enablement programs  including product specific briefings to partners and the inclusion of several partners in our beta programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments  and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments  and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments  and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments  and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  facilities restructuring charges  income taxes  impairment of goodwill  acquisitions  share based payments  and allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see the discussion in note summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
revenue recognition we follow detailed revenue recognition guidelines  which are discussed below 
we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states that have been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules  which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments  such as determining if collectibility is probable 
we derive revenues from software license fees  maintenance fees which entitle the customer to receive product support and unspecified software updates  and professional services  consisting of consulting and education services 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
the basis for recognizing software license revenue is determined by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop software revenue recognition  together with other authoritative literature including  but not limited to  the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  see the subsection revenue recognition in note summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
substantially all of our software licenses are perpetual licenses under which the customer acquires the perpetual right to use the software as provided and subject to the conditions of the license agreement 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
in applying these criteria to revenue transactions  we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of software  maintenance  and professional services revenue to be recognized at each period 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue 
we must make interpretations of our customer contracts and exercise judgments in determining if the fees associated with a license arrangement are fixed or determinable 
we consider factors including extended payment terms  financing arrangements  the category of customer end user customer or reseller  
table of contents rights of return or refund  and our history of enforcing the terms and conditions of customer contracts 
if the fee due from a customer is not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms  revenue is recognized when payment becomes due or upon cash receipt  whichever is earlier 
if we determine that a fee due from a reseller is not fixed or determinable upon shipment to the reseller  we do not recognize the revenue until the reseller provides us with evidence of sell through to an end user customer and or upon cash receipt 
further  we make judgment in determining the collectibility of the amounts due from our customers that could possibly impact the timing of revenue recognition 
we assess credit worthiness and collectibility  and  when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized when payment is received 
our software license arrangements include the following multiple elements license fees from our core software products and or product upgrades that are not part of post contract services  maintenance fees  consulting  and or education services 
we use the residual method to recognize license revenue upon delivery when the arrangement includes elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
if vsoe does not exist for any undelivered software product element of the arrangement  all revenue is deferred until all elements have been delivered  or vsoe is established 
if vsoe does not exist for any undelivered services elements of the arrangement  all revenue is recognized ratably over the period that the services are expected to be performed 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining if vsoe exists for each undelivered element 
consulting services  if included as part of the software arrangement  generally do not require significant modification or customization of the software 
if  in our judgment  the software arrangement includes significant modification or customization of the software  then software license revenue is recognized as the consulting services revenue is recognized 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services and product configurations 
these services are performed on a time and materials basis and  occasionally  on a fixed fee basis 
revenue is generally recognized as these services are performed 
if uncertainty exists about our ability to complete the project  our ability to collect the amounts due  or in the case of fixed fee consulting arrangements  our ability to estimate the remaining costs to be incurred to complete the project  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
multiple contracts with a single counterparty executed within close proximity of each other are evaluated to determine if the contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single arrangement 
we recognize revenues net of applicable sales taxes  financing charges that we have absorbed  and amounts retained by our resellers and distributors  if any 
our agreements do not permit for returns  and historically we have not had any significant returns or refunds  therefore  we have not established a sales return reserve at this time 
facilities restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded significant charges restructuring plan related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters  to take advantage of more favorable lease terms and reduce our operating expenses 
the accrued restructuring charges represent net present value of lease obligations and estimated commissions and other costs principally leasehold improvements and asset write offs  offset by actual and estimated gross sublease income  which is net of estimated broker commissions and tenant improvement allowances  expected to be received over the remaining lease terms 
in addition  we significantly increased the restructuring charges restructuring plan in the third and fourth quarters of due to changes in our assumptions used to calculate the original charges  as a result of our decision to relocate our corporate headquarters 
these liabilities include management s estimates pertaining to sublease activities 
inherent in the assessment of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are estimates related to the probability weighted outcomes of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
we will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions periodically to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly depending  in part on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the global economic downturn  time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and market rates at the time of subleases 
currently  we have subleased our excess facilities in connection with our and facilities restructuring but for durations that are generally less than the remaining lease terms 
if we determine that there is a change in the estimated sublease rates or in the expected time it will take us to sublease our vacant space  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future and our cash position could be adversely affected 
see note facilities restructuring charges  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
future adjustments to the charges could result from a change in the time period that the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease rates  expected sublease terms  and the expected time it will take to sublease 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin no 
to account for any income tax contingencies 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of any future changes in tax laws or rates have not been taken into account 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable  and to the extent we believe that realizability is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in assessing the need for any additional non share based payments valuation allowance  we considered all the evidence available to us both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  legislative developments  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
as a result of this analysis for the year ended december   we considered it more likely than not that our non stock option related deferred tax assets would be realized 
as such  the remaining valuation allowance is primarily related to our share based payments deferred tax assets 
the benefit of these deferred tax assets will be recorded in the stockholders equity as realized  and as such  they will not reduce our effective tax rate 
accounting for impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas no 
consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment  we have determined that there is only one reporting unit 
we tested goodwill for impairment in our annual impairment tests on october of each of the years   and  using the two step process required by sfas no 
first  we review the carrying amount of the reporting unit compared to the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of our common stock 
second  if such comparison reflects potential impairment  we would then perform the discounted cash flow analyses 
these analyses are based on cash flow assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage our business 
an excess carrying value to fair value would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
finally  if we determined that goodwill may be impaired  then we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
we determined in our annual impairment tests on october    and that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount and  accordingly  goodwill had not been impaired 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
accounting for impairment of goodwill will be impacted by certain elements of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  related to fasb staff position fsp no 
for non financial assets and liabilities  which is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we will apply this pronouncement to our accounting for impairment of goodwill in 
table of contents acquisitions in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as to in process research and development ipr d based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities  and pre acquisition contingencies 
a number of events could potentially affect the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates that we have made are reasonable and appropriate  nevertheless a level of uncertainty is inherent in all such decisions 
the following are some of the examples of critical accounting estimates that we have applied in our acquisitions future expected cash flows from software license sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired 
the sum of these costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
we also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
in any acquisition  we may identify certain pre acquisition contingencies 
if we are able to determine the fair value of such contingencies during the purchase price allocation period  we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation 
on the other hand  if as of the end of the purchase price allocation period  we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 with the exception of unresolved income tax matters and certain earn out payments  after the end of the purchase price allocation period  any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre acquisition contingency will be included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
accounting for business combinations will be impacted by certain elements of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  related to fsp no 
for non financial assets and liabilities  sfas no 
r  business combinations  and fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which became all effective for us on january  we will apply these pronouncements to any business combinations consummated in share based payments we account for share based payments related to share based transactions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably on a straight line basis over its requisite service period 
it requires a certain amount of judgment to select the appropriate fair value model and calculate the fair value of share based awards  including estimating 
table of contents stock price volatility and expected life 
further  estimates of forfeiture rates could shift the share based payments from one period to the next 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our current estimate of volatility was based upon a blend of average historical and market based implied volatilities of our stock price that we have used consistently since the adoption of sfas no 
r in our volatility rates were   and for   and  respectively 
the increase in from was due to fluctuations in our stock price during the latter part of the decline in the volatility rate in compared to was primarily due to stabilization of stock prices in and a decline in the historical component of our volatility rates 
our historical volatility in compared to remained relatively unchanged  but the historical volatility in compared to declined due to the exclusion of more volatile years from the calculation of our historical volatility rates 
our implied volatility rates in increased due to more volatile stock prices in the stock market  but the implied volatility in remained relatively unchanged compared to to the extent that the volatility rate in our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted will increase accordingly 
for example  a higher volatility rate in would have increased the fair value of the options that we granted in that year by approximately million 
we derived our expected life of the options that we granted in from the historical option exercises  post vesting cancellations  and estimates concerning future exercises and cancellations for vested and unvested options that remain outstanding 
we lowered our expected life estimate from years in to years in 
the lower expected life of options was mainly due to reduction in contractual term of our new grants from years to years in april  and also higher exercise volume due to higher stock prices during the most recent quarters 
the expected life remained unchanged at years in a reduction in the expected life from years to years reduces the fair value of the granted options by approximately 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate in determining the amount of share based payments 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based on an average of actual forfeited options for the past four quarters 
we lowered our forfeiture rate for the quarter ended march   from to based on the average of actual forfeited options during the four quarters in  which increased our share based payments in the first quarter of by approximately million 
we believe that the estimates that we have used for the calculation of the variables to arrive at share based payments are accurate 
we will  however  continue to monitor the historical performance of these variables and will modify our methodology and assumptions in the future as needed 
allowances for doubtful accounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts based on our review of credit profiles of our customers  contractual terms and conditions  current economic trends and historical payment  and return and discount experiences 
we reassess the allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter 
however  unexpected events or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to our future statements of operations and of cash flows 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and were million and million  respectively

the increase in license revenues in from was primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions and to a lesser extent due to an increase in the average size of our transactions and an increase in international license revenues 
we have two types of upgrades upgrades that are not part of the post contract services for which we charge customers an additional fee  and upgrades that are part of the post contract services that we provide to our customers at no additional charge  
table of contents when and if available 
the average transaction amount for orders greater than  in  including upgrades  for which we charge customers an additional fee  decreased to  from  and  in and  respectively 
the number of transactions greater than million decreased to in from and  in and  respectively due to the global economic downturn

consulting and education services revenues consulting and education services revenues were million or of total revenues in  million or of total revenues in  and million or of total revenues in the million or increase in compared to was primarily due to a higher demand for our consulting and education services globally 
the million or increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in demand for consulting and education services in europe and north america 
our utilization rates have declined recently due to the global economic slowdowns 
as a result  we expect our revenues from consulting and education services to decline or remain the same in from the levels 
international revenues our international revenues were million or of total revenues in  million or of total revenues in  and million or of total revenues in  representing an increase of million or in from  and an increase of million or in from the million or increase in from was primarily due to an increase in international license and service revenues as a result of a larger and growing installed customer base 
the million or increase in from in international revenues was primarily due to our expansion in europe  asia pacific  and latin america 
we expect international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in to be relatively consistent with future revenues new orders  backlog  and deferred revenue our future revenues include backlog consisting primarily of product license orders that have not shipped as of the end of a given quarter  orders received from certain distributors  resellers  and oems  not included in deferred revenues  where revenue is recognized based on cash receipt collectively and are aggregate backlog  and deferred revenues 
our deferred revenues consist primarily of the following maintenance revenues that we recognize over the term of the contract  typically one year  license product orders that have shipped but where the terms of the license agreement contain acceptance language or other terms that require that the license revenues be deferred until all revenue recognition criteria are met or recognized ratably over an extended period  and consulting and education services revenues that have been prepaid but for which services have not yet been performed 
we typically ship products shortly after the receipt of an order  which is common in the software industry  and historically our backlog of license orders awaiting shipment at the end of any given quarter has varied 
however  our backlog typically decreases from the prior quarter at the end of the first and third quarters and increases at the end of the fourth quarter although the increase was less pronounced at the end of aggregate backlog and deferred revenues at december  were approximately million compared to million at december  this increase in was primarily due to an increase in deferred license and maintenance revenues 
backlog and deferred revenues  as of any particular date  are not necessarily indicative of future results

cost of license revenues was million or of license revenues in  million or of license revenues in  and million or of license revenues in the million or decrease in from was primarily due to the smaller proportion of royalty based products being shipped in the million or decrease in from was primarily due to lower transaction volumes of sales for royalty bearing products 
we expect that our cost of license revenues in  as a percentage of license revenues  to be consistent with levels 
cost of service revenues our cost of service revenues is a combination of costs of maintenance  consulting  and education services revenues 
our cost of maintenance revenues consists mainly of costs associated with customer service personnel expenses and royalty fees for maintenance related to third party software providers 
cost of consulting revenues consists primarily of personnel costs and expenses incurred in providing consulting services at customers facilities 
cost of education services revenues consists primarily of the costs of developing course curriculum and providing training classes and materials at our headquarters  sales and training offices  and customer locations 
cost of service revenues was million or of service revenues in  million or of service revenues in  and million or of service revenues in the million or increase in from was proportional to the increase in service revenues and was primarily due to higher subcontractor fees in our consulting services group and headcount growth primarily in the customer support group

our results of operations have been positively affected since by a significant decrease in rent expense and decreases to non cash depreciation and amortization expense for the leasehold improvements and equipment written off 
these combined savings were approximately to million annually compared to  after accretion charges  and we anticipate that they will continue through in addition  we will continue to evaluate our current facilities requirements to identify facilities that are in excess of our current and estimated future needs 
we will also evaluate the assumptions related to estimated future sublease income for excess facilities 
accordingly  any changes to these estimates of excess facilities costs could result in additional charges that could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations

we expect our effective tax rate to decline in  but this rate is highly dependent on the result of our international operations as well as the outcome of various tax audits 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through cash flows from operations and public offerings of our common stock in the past 
as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
our primary sources of cash are the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan 
our uses of cash include payroll and payroll related expenses and operating expenses such as marketing programs  travel  professional services  and facilities and related costs 
we have also used cash to purchase property and equipment  repurchase common stock from the open market to reduce the dilutive impact of stock option issuances  repurchase our convertible senior notes  and acquire businesses and technologies to expand our product offerings 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities in was million  representing an increase of million from this increase resulted primarily from a million increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses  an increase in accounts receivable cash collections  an increase in income taxes payable  and an increase in accrued liabilities 
these increases were offset by payments to reduce our accrual for excess facilities and excess tax benefits from share based payments 
we recognized the excess tax benefits from share based payments for million during the year ended december  this amount is recorded as a use of operating activities and an offsetting amount is recorded as a provision by financing activities 
we made cash payments for taxes in different jurisdictions for million during the year ended december  our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased from days at december  to days at december   due to a higher amount of billings which occurred toward the end of  compared to deferred revenues increased primarily due to an increase in deferred maintenance revenues resulting from a larger customer base

our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreased from days at december  to days at december  due to improvements in our collection program

our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased from days at december  to days at december  due to a higher amount of billings which occurred toward the end of deferred revenues increased primarily due to a larger customer base and assumed deferred revenue in connection with the acquisition of itemfield in december investing activities we acquire property and equipment in our normal course of business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods depend on a number of factors  including the hiring of employees  the rate of upgrade of computer hardware and software used in our business  as well as our business outlook 
we have identified our investment portfolio as available for sale based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and our investment objectives are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk

we invest only in money 
table of contents market funds and short term marketable securities 
we believe that the purchase  maturity  or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
our revised and more conservative investment strategy has not impacted our liquidity 
we have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings  and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
due to the nature of these transactions  it is difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements 
in march  we invested million in the preferred stock of a privately held company that we account for on a cost basis 
on may   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of identity systems  inc  a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of intellisync corporation  for million in cash  including transaction costs of million and acquired cash of million 
on october   informatica nederland bv  a wholly owned subsidiary of informatica  purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of powerdata iberica  sl  a company organized under the laws of spain for million in cash  including transaction costs of million 
as of june  we were no longer required to maintain certificates of deposits for the million letter of credit that a financial institution issued in for our former corporate headquarters leases at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california 
accordingly  we classified the release of such restricted cash associated with such certificates of deposits from investing activities to operating activities 
financing activities we receive cash from the exercise of common stock options and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan espp 
net cash used in financing activities in was million due to repurchases and retirement of our common stock for million and our convertible senior notes for million 
these repurchases were offset by the issuance of common stock to option holders and to participants of our espp program for million  and million of excess tax benefits from share based payments

net cash provided by financing activities in was million including issuance of convertible debt for million and issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of espp for million  which were partially offset by a million repurchase and retirement of common stock and a million payment of debt issuance costs 
although we expect to continue to receive some proceeds from the issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of espp in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors  including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan  and general market conditions 
in march  we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due in notes 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the purchase of  shares of our common stock concurrently with the offering of the notes 
we intend to use the balance of the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights or technologies  strategic investments  or additional purchases of common stock or convertible senior notes 
in april  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock at any time until april as of april   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
in april  our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of million of our common stock under the existing stock repurchase program 
we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million in and in april  our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of million of our common stock under the stock repurchase program 
in october  informatica s board of directors authorized  under the existing stock repurchase program  the repurchase of a portion of its outstanding notes due in in privately negotiated transactions with holders of the notes 
as of december   we repurchased  shares of our stock at a cost of million  and we retired million of our convertible senior notes at a cost of million 
we have approximately million remaining available to repurchase shares of our stock or convertible senior notes under this program as of december  this repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
purchases can be made from time to time in the open market and will be funded from our available cash 
the primary purpose of these programs is to enhance shareholder value by partially offsetting the dilutive impact of stock based incentive plans 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases are based on several factors  including the price of our common stock  our liquidity and working capital needs  general business and market conditions  and other investment opportunities 
the repurchased shares are retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued shares of common stock 
see part ii  item of this report for more 
table of contents information regarding the stock and convertible senior notes repurchase program 
we may continue to repurchase shares and convertible senior notes from time to time  as determined by management under programs approved by the board of directors 
we believe that our cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
given our cash balances  it is less likely but still possible that we may require or desire additional funds for purposes such as acquisitions  and we may raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
beginning on march  and then upon march   and march   or upon the occurrence of certain events including a change in control  holders of the notes may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to the full principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest as of the relevant date 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time  and any financing we obtain might be dilutive to our stockholders 
contractual obligations and operating leases the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations  including future minimum lease payments at december   under non cancelable operating leases with original terms in excess of one year  and the effect of such obligations on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods in thousands payment due by period total and and and beyond operating lease obligations operating lease payments future sublease income net operating lease obligations debt obligations principal payments interest payments other obligations holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to the full principle amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest on march   march   and march   or upon the occurrence of certain events including a change in control 
we have the right to redeem some or all of the notes after march  other purchase obligations and commitments include minimum royalty payments under license agreements and do not include purchase obligations discussed below 
our contractual obligations at december  include the lease term for our headquarters office in redwood city  california  which is from december  to december  minimum contractual lease payments are million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
the above commitment table does not include approximately million of long term income tax liabilities recorded in accordance with fin no 
because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these potential future payments 
contractual obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and services are not included in the preceding table 
we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally 
table of contents contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above 
we adopted fin no 
effective january  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
as a result  this amount is not included in the table above 
for further information  see note  income taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
we estimate the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
operating leases we lease certain office facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
during  we recorded facilities restructuring charges related to the consolidation of excess leased facilities in redwood city  california 
operating lease payments in the table above include approximately million  net of actual sublease income  for operating lease commitments for those facilities that are included in accrued facilities restructuring charges 
see note facilities restructuring charges and note commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
of these future minimum lease payments  we have million recorded in accrued facilities restructuring charges at december  this accrual  in addition to minimum lease payments of million  includes estimated operating expenses of million  is net of estimated sublease income of million  and is net of the present value impact of million recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards board no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

we estimated sublease income and the related timing thereof based on existing sublease agreements and current market conditions  among other factors 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly from actual amounts realized depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
in relation to our excess facilities  we may decide to negotiate and enter into lease termination agreements  if and when the circumstances are appropriate 
these lease termination agreements would likely require that a significant amount of the remaining future lease payments be paid at the time of execution of the agreement  but would release us from future lease payment obligations for the abandoned facility 
the timing of a lease termination agreement and the corresponding payment could materially affect our cash flows in the period of payment 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different 
we have sublease agreements for leased office space at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california 
in the event the sublessees are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
we expect at this time that the sublessees will fulfill their obligations under the terms of the current lease agreements 
in february  we entered into two lease agreements for two buildings at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california our former corporate headquarters  which we occupied from august through december these two lease agreements will expire in july other uses of cash in october and may  and january and december  in connection with the powerdata  identity systems  inc  similarity and itemfield acquisitions  we used approximately million  million  million  and million cash  respectively  as part of the consideration 
a portion of our cash may be further used to acquire or invest in other complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use other complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products  or technologies 
the nature of these transactions makes it difficult to 
table of contents predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements 
we may also be required to raise additional financing to complete future acquisitions 
letters of credit in  a financial institution issued a million letter of credit  which required us to maintain certificates of deposit as collateral until the leases expire in as of june  however  we were no longer required to maintain certificates of deposits for this letter of credit related to our former corporate headquarters leases at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we market and sell our software and services through our direct sales force and indirect channel partners in north america  europe  asia pacific  and latin america 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency  except for informatica cayman ltd  which is in euros 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in foreign currencies  in particular the euro and british pound  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities in those foreign currencies 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
our foreign operations  however  in most instances act as a natural hedge since both operating expenses as well as revenues are generally denominated in their respective local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  the operating expenditures will be lower as well 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the indian rupee  israeli shekel  euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  japanese yen  brazilian real  and australian dollar 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we have attempted to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations through hedging programs for the foreign subsidiaries where we do not have a natural hedge 
the purpose of these programs is to reduce volatility of identified cash flow and earnings caused by movement in certain foreign currency exchange rates  in particular  indian rupee and israeli shekel foreign currency exchange rates 
any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the gain or loss derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures upon payment 
cash flow hedge activities beginning in the fourth quarter of  we have attempted to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations through initiation of certain cash flow hedge programs 
the purpose of these programs is to reduce volatility in cash flows and earnings caused by movement in certain foreign currency exchange rates  in particular indian rupee and israeli shekel foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents the table below presents the notional amounts of the foreign exchange forward contracts that the company committed to purchase in the fourth quarter of for indian rupees and israeli shekels in thousands functional currency foreign amount usd equivalent indian rupee israeli shekel we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the effective portion related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to operating expenditures 
if the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur for any reason  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
we did not incur any gains or losses in the other income or expense in due to occurrence of ineffectiveness in our previously forecasted hedging transactions 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer  or type of investment 
our investments consist primarily of us government notes and bonds  corporate bonds  commercial paper and municipal securities 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
see note cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the following table presents the fair value of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk and the average interest rate as of december  and dollars in thousands december  cash and short term investments average rate of return our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
as of december   we had net unrealized gains of million associated with these securities 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair market value of the portfolio would change by approximately million 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not necessarily expect to realize an adverse impact on income or cash flows 
at this time  we expect our average rate of return to drop by approximately to basis points during
