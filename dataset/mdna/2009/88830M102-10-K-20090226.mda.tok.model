market conditions and outlook titan experienced strong demand for its agricultural and earthmoving construction products throughout the continued strength of the agricultural market  resulting from high commodity prices and a gradual increase in the use of biofuels  contributed to the increase in sales

if oil prices remain lower  farmers will benefit from lower input costs for fuel and fertilizer

however  in the long term  these prices are expected to remain at levels that are attractive for continued investment  which will maintain support for earthmoving and mining sales 
the significant decline in the united states housing market continues to cause a decline in equipment used for housing construction 
the giant otr project will add significant capacity for giant mining tires in the additional sales of these giant otr tires are expected to more than offset any softness in other areas of the earthmoving construction market 
the earthmoving construction market is affected by many variables  including commodity prices  road construction  infrastructure  government appropriations  housing starts and the current banking and credit crisis 
consumer market outlook the current overall uncertainty in consumer spending resulting from the current banking and credit crisis  housing market decline  and high energy and food costs has affected the company s consumer market sales 
titan s sales in the consumer market include sales to goodyear  which includes an off take mixing agreement
