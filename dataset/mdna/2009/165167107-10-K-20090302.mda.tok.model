table of contents we manage our business as three separate operational segments exploration and production  marketing  and service operations  which is comprised of our wholly owned drilling and trucking operations 
we refer you to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for  and and our assets as of december   and executive summary we are the largest independent producer of natural gas in the united states 
we own interests in approximately  producing oil and natural gas wells that are currently producing approximately bcfe per day  of which is natural gas 
our strategy is focused on discovering  acquiring and developing conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves onshore in the us  primarily in the big natural gas shale plays the barnett shale in the fort worth basin of north central texas  the haynesville shale in the ark la tex area of northwestern louisiana and east texas  the fayetteville shale in the arkoma basin of central arkansas and the marcellus shale in the northern appalachian basin of west virginia  pennsylvania and new york 
we also have substantial operations in various other plays  both conventional and unconventional  in the mid continent  appalachian basin  permian basin  delaware basin  south texas  texas gulf coast and ark la tex regions of the united states 
during  chesapeake continued the industry s most active drilling program drilling  gross  net operated wells and participating in another  gross net wells operated by other companies 
the company s drilling success rate was for company operated wells and for non operated wells 
also during  we invested billion in operated wells using an average of operated rigs and million in non operated wells using an average of non operated rigs for total drilling  completing and equipping costs of billion 
chesapeake began with estimated proved reserves of tcfe and ended the year with tcfe  an increase of tcfe  or 
during  we replaced bcfe of production with an internally estimated tcfe of new proved reserves  for a reserve replacement rate of 
reserve replacement through the drillbit was tcfe  or of production  including tcfe of positive performance revisions and bcfe of negative revisions resulting from natural gas and oil price decreases between december  and december  reserve replacement through the acquisition of proved reserves was bcfe 
during  we divested bcfe of estimated proved reserves 
our annual decline rate on producing properties is projected to be from to  from to  from to  from to and from to our percentage of proved undeveloped reserve additions to total proved reserve additions was approximately in  in and in based on our current drilling schedule and budget  we expect that virtually all of the proved undeveloped reserves added in will begin producing within the next three to five years 
generally  proved developed reserves are producing at the time they are added or will begin producing within one year 
since  chesapeake has invested billion in new leasehold net of divestitures and d seismic acquisitions and now owns the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold million net acres and d seismic million acres in the us on this leasehold  the company has approximately  net drillsites representing more than a year inventory of drilling projects 
business strategy our exploration  development and acquisition activities require us to make substantial operating and capital expenditures 
through the middle of  we increased our capital expenditure budget for and several times in response to higher leasehold acquisition costs and in order to accelerate leasehold acquisition and drilling in the haynesville shale and other plays 
during the second half of  in response to a significant decrease in natural gas prices  deteriorating global economic conditions and outlook and concerns about a 
table of contents potential oversupply of natural gas in the us market  we significantly reduced our planned capital expenditures through year end in order to bring our planned operating and capital expenditures within our anticipated internally generated cash flow 
our current budgeted capital expenditures for drilling  leasehold and producing property acquisitions  geophysical costs  and additions to midstream  compression and other property and equipment are billion to billion in and billion to billion in cash flow from operations is our primary source of liquidity used to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures 
our billion revolving bank credit facility and our million midstream revolving bank credit facility  discussed more fully below  provide us with additional liquidity 
in response to the difficulties faced by several financial institutions and to ensure we had ample liquidity available  we borrowed the remaining capacity under our revolving bank credit facility at the end of the third quarter of as a result  we had borrowings of billion and letters of credit of million outstanding under that facility as of december  as of december   we had borrowings of million under the midstream credit facility 
during  we relied on capital markets financings and asset monetization transactions  such as sales of producing properties  undeveloped acreage and non strategic assets  joint venture arrangements and volumetric production payment  or vpp  transactions to provide us with additional capital 
since march   these types of transactions have provided approximately billion of new capital  and up to billion of our future drilling and completion costs in the haynesville  fayetteville and marcellus shales will be funded by our joint venture partners 
these transactions are summarized below from april through july of  we issued million shares of our common stock  million of our senior notes due and billion of our contingent convertible senior notes due  resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of billion 
the availability of any additional capital from the public or private markets is uncertain at this time 
in may  august and december of  we completed three separate vpp transactions involving approximately bcfe of proved reserves and net production at the time of sale of mmcfe per day from wells in texas  oklahoma and kansas  resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of billion 
in july of  we entered into a joint venture with plains exploration production company to develop our haynesville shale leasehold  under the terms of which plains acquired a interest in our approximately  net acres of haynesville shale leasehold for billion in cash  plains agreed to fund of our share of the costs associated with drilling and completing future haynesville shale joint venture wells over a multi year period  up to an additional billion and plains will have the right to a participation in any additional leasehold we acquire in the haynesville shale 
subsequently  in february  we amended the joint venture to provide plains a one time option in june to reduce its obligation to fund our drilling and completion costs by million in exchange for assigning us of its interest in the haynesville joint venture properties 
in august of  we sold  net acres of leasehold and producing natural gas properties with net production at the time of sale of mmcfe per day in the arkoma basin woodford shale play in oklahoma to bp america inc for billion in cash 
in september of  we entered into a joint venture with bp america inc to develop our fayetteville shale leasehold  under the terms of which bp acquired a interest in our approximately  net acres of fayetteville shale leasehold for billion in cash  bp agreed to fund of our share of the costs associated with drilling and completing future fayetteville shale joint venture wells over a multi year period  up to an additional million and bp will have the right to a participation in any additional leasehold we acquire in the fayetteville shale 
in november of  we entered into a joint venture with a us subsidiary of statoilhydro asa  under the terms of which statoilhydro acquired a interest in our approximately million net acres of marcellus shale leasehold for billion in cash  statoilhydro agreed to fund of 
table of contents our share of the costs associated with drilling and completing future marcellus shale joint venture wells over a multi year period  up to an additional billion and statoilhydro will have the right to a participation in any additional leasehold we acquire in the marcellus shale 
additionally  chesapeake and statoilhydro are evaluating opportunities for an international strategic alliance to jointly explore unconventional natural gas opportunities worldwide 
during the fourth quarter of  we privately exchanged million in aggregate principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due  our contingent convertible senior notes due and our contingent convertible senior notes due for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
our net debt as a percentage of total capitalization total capitalization is the sum of net debt less cash on hand and stockholders equity was as of december  and as of december  the average maturity of our long term debt as of december  was over eight years with an average interest rate of approximately 
no scheduled principal payments are required under our senior notes until when million is due 
we plan to continue to evaluate asset monetization transactions in order to create additional value from our proved and unproved properties and to increase our financial flexibility 
management believes that our leasehold and development joint ventures and various asset monetization programs benefit the company by improving our asset base  reducing our financial risk  decreasing our dd a rate and increasing our profitability per unit of production  thereby increasing our returns on capital and advancing future value creation 
we may also consider alternative sources of public or private investment in the company or its subsidiaries 
while we believe that our anticipated internally generated cash flow  cash resources and other sources of liquidity will allow us to fully fund our and operating and capital expenditure requirements  further deterioration of the economy and other factors could require us to fund these expenditures from monetization transactions or further curtail our spending 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds cash flow from operations is a significant source of liquidity used to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures 
cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared to billion in and billion in the million increase from to was primarily due to higher volumes of natural gas and oil production 
the million increase from to was primarily due to higher volumes of natural gas and oil production 
changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net income  excluding non cash items  such as depreciation  depletion and amortization  deferred income taxes and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives 
see the discussion below under results of operations 
changes in market prices for natural gas and oil directly impact the level of our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate the risk of declines in natural gas or oil prices and to provide more predictable future cash flow from operations  we currently have hedged through swaps and collars of our expected remaining natural gas and oil production in and of our expected natural gas and oil production in at average prices of and per mcfe  respectively 
our natural gas and oil hedges as of december  are detailed in item a of this report 
depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and management s view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
as of december   we had a net natural gas and oil derivative asset of billion 
we have arrangements with our hedging counterparties that allow us to minimize the potential liquidity impact of significant mark to market fluctuations in the value of our natural gas and oil hedges by making collateral allocations from our bank credit facility or directly pledging natural gas and oil properties  rather than posting cash or letters of credit with the counterparties 

table of contents our billion bank credit facility  our million midstream bank credit facility and cash and cash equivalents are other sources of liquidity 
following the february issuance of billion of senior notes due  there was as of february  billion of borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank credit facility and million of borrowing capacity under the midstream credit facility 
we use the facilities and cash on hand to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed 
we borrowed billion and repaid billion in  we borrowed billion and repaid billion in  and we borrowed billion and repaid billion in under our bank credit facilities 
a substantial portion of our natural gas and oil properties are not currently pledged under debt or hedging arrangements and therefore are available to be pledged as additional collateral under our revolving bank credit facility if needed based on our periodic borrowing base and collateral redeterminations 
accordingly  we believe our borrowing capacity will not be reduced associated with such periodic redeterminations 
on april   we issued million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of per share  and on july   we issued million shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
on may  we completed public offerings of million of our senior notes due and billion of our contingent convertible senior notes due these four offerings resulted in aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately billion  which we used to fund the redemption of our senior notes due and to temporarily repay indebtedness outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility 
the following table reflects the proceeds from sales of securities we issued in  and in millions total proceeds net proceeds total proceeds net proceeds total proceeds net proceeds common stock contingent convertible senior notes senior notes convertible preferred stock total in may  we sold a portion of our proved reserves in certain producing assets in texas  oklahoma and kansas in a vpp transaction for proceeds of approximately million  net of transaction costs 
we completed another vpp transaction in august  when we sold a portion of our proved reserves in certain producing assets in the anadarko basin of oklahoma for proceeds of approximately million  net of transaction costs 
also  in december  we sold certain long lived producing assets in the anadarko and arkoma basins in a vpp transaction for proceeds of approximately million  net of transaction costs 
approximately  million of the proceeds are being held in escrow until post closing adjustments have been finalized 
in august  we sold leasehold and producing natural gas properties in the arkoma basin woodford shale play in oklahoma for billion in cash 
in the second half of  the company entered into three joint venture arrangements covering three of the company s big shale plays 
in the joint ventures  the company has collaborated with other leading energy companies to accelerate the development of the company s properties in the haynesville shale  the fayetteville shale and the marcellus shale 
in total  we sold leasehold and producing property assets in which we had a cost basis of approximately billion to these three joint venture partners for total cash consideration of billion and up to billion of future drilling cost carries while we retained a majority interest in each joint venture 
the drilling cost carries of up to approximately billion that remain unused as of december  will be extremely valuable in the years ahead by enabling the company to develop reserves in these joint venture shale plays at greatly reduced costs 
we are also considering opportunities for other joint venture transactions to develop our properties 
our primary use of funds is for capital expenditures related to exploration  development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties 
we refer you to the table under investing activities below  which sets forth the components of our natural gas and oil investing activities and other investing activities for  and 
table of contents we retain a significant degree of control over the timing of our capital expenditures which permits us to defer or accelerate certain capital expenditures if necessary to address any potential liquidity issues 
in addition  higher drilling and field operating costs  drilling results that alter planned development schedules  acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program  which is largely discretionary 
we paid dividends on our common stock of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on common stock from to per share beginning with the dividend paid in july dividends paid on our preferred stock decreased to million in from million in and million in as a result of conversions and exchanges of preferred stock into common stock during and in  holders of our cumulative convertible preferred stock and our series b cumulative preferred stock exchanged  shares and  shares for  shares and  shares of common stock  respectively  in privately negotiated exchanges 
the exchanges resulted in a loss of million 
in  holders of our series cumulative convertible preferred stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock exchanged  shares and  shares for  and  shares of common stock  respectively  in public exchange offers 
the exchanges resulted in a loss million 
we received million  million and million from the exercise of employee and director stock options in  and  respectively 
we paid million  and million to purchase treasury stock in  and  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million were used to fund our matching contribution to our k and deferred compensation plans in and  respectively 
the remaining million in was used to purchase shares of common stock to be used upon the exercise of stock options under certain stock option plans 
in  and  we paid million  million and million  respectively  to settle a portion of the derivative liabilities assumed in our acquisition of columbia natural resources  llc 
sfas r requires tax benefits resulting from stock based compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes to be reported as cash flows from financing activities 
in  and  we reported a tax benefit from stock based compensation of million  million and million  respectively 
outstanding payments from certain disbursement accounts in excess of funded cash balances where no legal right of set off exists increased by million  decreased by million and increased by million in  and  respectively 
all disbursements are funded on the day they are presented to our bank using available cash on hand or draws on our revolving bank credit facility 
credit risk a significant portion of our liquidity is concentrated in both cash and cash equivalents and derivative instruments 
on december   our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds with investment grade ratings 
a significant portion of these funds was invested at the close of business on september   and is protected under the us treasury department s temporary guarantee program 
the remaining funds were spread among several counterparties to mitigate risk 
derivative instruments enable us to hedge a portion of our exposure to natural gas and oil prices and interest rate volatility 
these arrangements expose us to credit risk from our counterparties 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into derivative contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers and spread our instruments among multiple counterparties such that no single counterparty represents a material credit risk to the company 
recently there have been concerns about the ability of certain counterparties to continue to meet their financial obligations 
we monitor the creditworthiness of all our counterparties and do not believe a failure by a counterparty would have a material negative impact on our liquidity 

table of contents our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of natural gas and oil million at december  and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate million at december  
this industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we generally require letters of credit or parental guarantees for receivables from parties which are judged to have sub standard credit  unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated 
investing activities cash used in investing activities increased to billion in  compared to billion in and billion in we have continued our active drilling program and our acquisitions are focused on leasehold and property acquisitions needed for planned natural gas and oil development 
our investing activities during the past two years reflect our increasing focus on acquiring unproved leasehold and converting our resource inventory into production  redeploying our capital by selling natural gas and oil properties with lower rates of return and increasing our investment in properties with higher return potential  and investing in drilling rigs  midstream systems  compressors and other property and equipment to support our natural gas and oil exploration  development and production activities

in december  we registered million shares of common stock that we may offer and issue to acquire assets including mineral interests  businesses or securities of other companies 
as of february   we had issued approximately million shares of common stock for leasehold acquisitions and anticipate we may issue the remaining shares over the course of 
table of contents bank credit facilities we have a billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility that matures in november as of december   we had billion in outstanding borrowings under this facility and had utilized approximately million of the facility for various letters of credit 
to ensure that our revolving credit facility could be fully utilized in these turbulent economic times  we borrowed the remaining capacity under our facility at the end of the third quarter and invested the cash proceeds in short term highly liquid securities 
as a result  on december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of approximately billion 
all lenders that participate in our revolving credit facility fully funded their commitment  with the exception of lehman brothers commercial bank  a subsidiary of lehman brothers holdings inc  which has filed for bankruptcy protection 
lehman brothers commercial bank did not fund its million share of the advance 
borrowings under the facility are secured by certain producing natural gas and oil properties and bear interest at our option at either i the greater of the reference rate of union bank of california  na  or the federal funds effective rate plus or ii london interbank offered rate libor  plus a margin that varies from to per annum according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings 
the collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically 
the unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee that also varies according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings  from to per annum 
currently the commitment fee is per annum 
interest is payable quarterly or  if libor applies  it may be payable at more frequent intervals 
our subsidiaries  chesapeake exploration  llc and chesapeake appalachia  llc  are the borrowers under our revolving bank credit facility and chesapeake and all its other wholly owned restricted subsidiaries are guarantors 
the credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments or loans and create liens 
the credit facility agreement requires us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio as defined not to exceed to and an indebtedness to ebitda ratio as defined not to exceed to as defined by the credit facility agreement  our indebtedness to total capitalization ratio was to and our indebtedness to ebitda ratio was to at december  if we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants  the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
such acceleration  if involving a principal amount of million million in the case of our senior notes issued after  would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures  which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness 
the credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness of the company and its restricted subsidiaries that we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of million 
on october   we closed a new secured revolving bank credit facility for our non appalachian midstream operations  which have recently been restructured under a new unrestricted subsidiary  chesapeake midstream partners  lp cmp and its operating subsidiary  chesapeake midstream operating  llc cmo 
twelve financial institutions are in the facility bank group 
the facility matures in october  has initial availability of million and may be expanded up to million at cmo s option  subject to additional bank participation 
cmo is utilizing the facility to fund capital expenditures associated with building additional natural gas gathering and other systems associated with our drilling program and for general corporate purposes related to our midstream operations 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under the midstream credit facility 
the midstream credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit the ability of cmp and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  make investments or loans and create liens 
the credit facility agreement requires maintenance of an indebtedness to ebitda ratio as defined not to exceed to  and an ebitda as defined to interest expense coverage ratio of not less than to as defined by the credit facility agreement  our indebtedness to ebitda ratio was to and our ebitda to interest expense coverage ratio was to at december  if cmp or its subsidiaries should fail to perform their obligations under these and other covenants  the revolving credit commitment could be terminated 
table of contents and any outstanding borrowings under the midstream facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
the midstream credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness cmp and its subsidiaries may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of million 
hedging facilities we have six secured hedging facilities  each of which permits us to enter into cash settled natural gas and oil commodity transactions  valued by the counterparty  for up to a stated maximum value 
outstanding transactions under each facility are collateralized by certain of our natural gas and oil properties that do not secure any of our other obligations 
the value of reserve collateral pledged to each facility is required to be at least or times the fair value of transactions outstanding under each facility 
in addition  we may pledge collateral from our revolving bank credit facility  from time to time  to these facilities to meet any additional collateral coverage requirements 
the hedging facilities are subject to an annual exposure fee  which is assessed quarterly based on the average of the daily negative fair value amounts of the hedges  if any  during the quarter 
the hedging facilities contain the standard representations and default provisions that are typical of such agreements 
the agreements also contain various restrictive provisions which govern the aggregate natural gas and oil production volumes that we are permitted to hedge under all of our agreements at any one time 
the fair value of outstanding transactions  per annum exposure fees and the scheduled maturity dates are shown below

although the applicable interest rates and commitment fees in our revolving bank credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings  neither of our credit facilities nor the secured hedging facilities contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings

the notes are convertible  at the holder s option  prior to maturity under certain circumstances into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process 
one such triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter 
convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarter by quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes during the specified period and  as a result  the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the first quarter of under this provision 
the notes are also convertible  at the holder s option  during specified five day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock 
in general  upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note  the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
we will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years  under certain conditions

hedging activities natural gas and oil hedging activities our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the board of directors reviews the company s hedging program at its quarterly board meetings 
we believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging 
as of december   our natural gas and oil derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  basis protection swaps  knockout swaps  cap swaps  call options  put options and collars 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contains a description of each of these instruments 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged natural gas and oil production 
we closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss 
commodity markets are volatile and chesapeake s hedging activities are dynamic

a detailed explanation of accounting for foreign currency derivatives under sfas appears under application of critical accounting policies hedging elsewhere in this item results of operations general 
for the year ended december   chesapeake had net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion 
this compares to net income of billion  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion during the year ended december   and net income of billion  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion during the year ended december  natural gas and oil sales 
during  natural gas and oil sales were billion compared to billion in and billion in in  chesapeake produced and sold bcfe of natural gas and oil at a weighted average price of per mcfe  compared to bcfe in at a weighted average price of per mcfe  and bcfe in at a weighted average price of per mcfe weighted average prices 
table of contents for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in prices in resulted in a decrease in revenue of million and increased production resulted in a billion increase  for a total increase in revenues of billion excluding unrealized gains or losses on natural gas and oil derivatives 
the increase in production from period to period was primarily generated from the drillbit 
for  we realized an average price per mcf of natural gas of  compared to in and in weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives 
oil prices realized per barrel excluding unrealized gains or losses on derivatives were  and in  and  respectively 
realized gains or losses from our natural gas and oil derivatives resulted in a net decrease in natural gas and oil revenues of million or per mcfe in  a net increase of billion or per mcfe in and a net increase of billion or per mcfe in a change in natural gas and oil prices has a significant impact on our natural gas and oil revenues and cash flows 
assuming production levels  a change of per mcf of natural gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flows of approximately million and million  respectively  and a change of per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flows of approximately million without considering the effect of hedging activities 
the following table shows our production by region for  and years ended december  mmcfe percent mmcfe percent mmcfe percent mid continent a b barnett shale permian and delaware basins south texas and texas gulf coast ark la tex appalachian basin c total production a was impacted by the sale of bcf and bcf of production in vpp transactions that closed on may  and august   respectively 
b was impacted by the sale of bcf and bcf of production from arkoma and fayetteville properties  respectively 
c was impacted by the sale of bcf of production in a vpp transaction that closed on december  natural gas production represented approximately of our total production volume on a natural gas equivalent basis in  compared to in and in natural gas and oil marketing sales and operating expenses 
natural gas and oil marketing activities are substantially for third parties who are owners in chesapeake operated wells 
chesapeake realized billion in natural gas and oil marketing sales to third parties in  with corresponding natural gas and oil marketing expenses of billion  for a net margin before depreciation of million 
this compares to sales of billion and billion  expenses of billion and billion  and margins before depreciation of million and million in and  respectively 
the net margin increase in and is primarily due to an increase in volumes related to natural gas and oil marketing sales 
service operations revenue and operating expenses 
service operations consist of third party revenue and operating expenses related to our drilling and oilfield trucking operations 
chesapeake recognized million in service operations revenue in with corresponding service operations expenses of million  
table of contents for a net margin before depreciation of million 
this compares to revenue of million and million  expenses of million and million and a net margin before depreciation of million and million in and  respectively 
these operations have grown as a result of assets and businesses we acquired and leased as seen in the growth in revenues 
however  the net margins have decreased each of the previous three years 
this is the result of increased expenses associated with the leasing cost of the numerous rigs we have sold and leased back in the previous three years 
production expenses 
production expenses  which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes  were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
on a unit of production basis  production expenses were per mcfe in compared to and per mcfe in and  respectively 
the expense increase in was primarily due to higher third party field service costs  energy costs  fuel costs  ad valorem taxes and personnel costs 
our per unit increase in was also affected by the loss of production related to the sale of the volumetric production payments 
we expect that production expenses per mcfe produced for will range from to 
production taxes 
production taxes were million in compared to million in and million in on a unit of production basis  production taxes were per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in and per mcfe in the million increase in production taxes from to is due to an increase in production of bcfe and an increase in the realized average sales price of natural gas and oil of per mcfe excluding gains or losses on derivatives 
in general  production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when natural gas and oil prices are higher 
we expect production taxes for to range from to per mcfe based on estimated nymex prices ranging from to per mcf of natural gas and an oil price of per barrel 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses  including stock based compensation but excluding internal costs capitalized to our natural gas and oil properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses were  and per mcfe for  and  respectively 
the increase in  and was the result of increasing labor costs due to the company s continued growth as well as increased media and advocacy expenditures 
included in general and administrative expenses is stock based compensation of million in  million in and million in the increase was mainly due to an increase in the number of unvested restricted shares outstanding during compared to and as a result of growth in our employment 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses for will be between and per mcfe produced  including stock based compensation ranging from to per mcfe produced 
our stock based compensation for employees and non employee directors is in the form of restricted stock 
employee restricted stock awards generally vest over a period of four or five years 
our non employee director awards vest over a period of three years 
the discussion of stock based compensation in note and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report provides additional detail on the accounting for and reporting of our stock based compensation 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with natural gas and oil property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we capitalized million  million and million of internal costs in  and  respectively  directly related to our natural gas and oil property acquisition  exploration and development efforts 
natural gas and oil depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of natural gas and oil properties was billion  billion and billion during  and 
table of contents  respectively 
the average dd a rate per mcfe  which is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs  and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented  was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the average rate from in to in is due primarily to the reduction of our natural gas and oil full cost pool resulting from our divestitures in and the addition of reserves through our exploration activities 
we expect the dd a rate to be between and per mcfe produced 
depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization of other assets was million in  compared to million in and million in the average d a rate per mcfe was  and in  and  respectively 
property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis 
buildings are depreciated over to years  gathering facilities are depreciated over years  drilling rigs are depreciated over years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from two to ten years 
to the extent company owned drilling rigs are used to drill our wells  a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in natural gas and oil properties as exploration or development costs 
we expect depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between and per mcfe produced 
impairment of natural gas and oil properties and other fixed assets 
due to lower commodity prices at december   we reported a non cash impairment charge of billion for we account for our natural gas and oil properties using the full cost method of accounting  which limits the amount of costs we can capitalize and requires us to write off these costs if the carrying value of natural gas and oil assets in the evaluated portion of our full cost pool exceeds the sum of the present value of expected future net cash flows of proved reserves using a pre tax discount rate based on constant pricing and cost assumptions and the present value of certain natural gas and oil hedges 
additionally in  we recorded an impairment of million associated with certain of our midstream assets 
employee retirement expense 
our president and chief operating officer  tom l 
ward  resigned as a director  officer and employee of the company effective february  mr 
ward s resignation agreement provided for the immediate vesting of all of his unvested equity awards  which consisted of options to purchase  shares of chesapeake s common stock at an average exercise price of per share and  shares of restricted common stock 
as a result of this vesting  we incurred an expense of million in interest and other income 
interest and other income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the loss consisted of million of interest income  a million loss related to our equity in the net losses of certain investments  a million gain on sale of assets  million of expense related to consent solicitation fees and million of miscellaneous income 
the income consisted of million of interest income and million of miscellaneous income 
income related to equity investments was not significant in the income consisted of million of interest income  million of income related to equity investments  a million gain on sale of assets and million of miscellaneous income 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in and million in as follows years ended december  in millions interest expense on senior notes and revolving bank credit facility capitalized interest amortization of loan discount and other unrealized gain loss on interest rate derivatives realized gain loss on interest rate derivatives total interest expense average long term borrowings 
table of contents interest expense  excluding unrealized gains losses on interest rate derivatives was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in and per mcfe in the decrease in interest expense per mcfe for is due to increased production volumes and an increase in capitalized interest 
capitalized interest increased in and as a result of a significant increase in unevaluated properties  the base on which interest is capitalized 
we expect interest expense for to be between and per mcfe produced before considering the effect of interest rate derivatives 
gain on exchanges or repurchases of chesapeake debt 
in  we redeemed million of our senior notes due with proceeds from the issuance of new senior notes with a lower rate of interest 
in connection with the redemption  we recorded a million loss which consisted of a million premium and the write off of million in various charges associated with the notes 
also in  we privately exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due  our contingent convertible senior notes due and our contingent convertible senior notes due for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the difference between the face value of the notes that were exchanged and the fair value of the common stock issued resulted in a gain of million on the cancellation of indebtedness 
impairment of investments 
in  we recorded a million impairment of certain investments 
each of our investees has been impacted by the dramatic slowing of the worldwide economy and the freezing of the credit markets in the fourth quarter of and into the economic weakness has resulted in significantly reduced natural gas and oil prices leading to a meaningful decline in the overall level of activity in the markets served by our investees 
associated with the weakness in performance of certain of the investees  as well as an evaluation of their financial condition and near term prospects  we recognized that an other than temporary impairment had occurred on the following investments chaparral energy  inc  million  dhs drilling company  million  mountain drilling company  million  and ventura refining and transmission llc  inc  million 
gain on sale of investments 
in  we sold our limited partnership interest in eagle energy partners i  lp  which we first acquired in  for proceeds of million and a gain of million 
in  chesapeake sold its investment in publicly traded pioneer drilling company common stock  realizing proceeds of million and a gain of million 
at the time of sale  we owned of the common stock of pioneer  which we began acquiring in income tax expense 
chesapeake recorded income tax expense of million in compared to income tax expense of million in and billion in of the income tax expense recorded in  million is reflected as current income tax expense and million is reflected as deferred income tax expense 
the divestitures that closed during are projected to generate sufficient taxable income for the year to exhaust all our non limited nols and result in a current tax liability for the tax year ended december  of the million decrease in  million was the result of the decrease in net income before taxes which was offset by million as the result of an increase in the effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in and in our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences 
we expect our effective income tax rate to be in loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock 
loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item for further detail regarding these transactions 
application of critical accounting policies readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the four policies we consider to be 
table of contents the most significant are discussed below 
the company s management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the selection and application of accounting policies are an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
hedging 
chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in natural gas and oil  changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of natural gas and oil derivative transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales  and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within natural gas and oil sales or interest expense 
cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged  or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in natural gas and oil sales 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings 
see hedging activities above and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices  volatility curves and discount factors 
these estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness 
derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations 
such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments  but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives 
the values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions and other factors 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 

table of contents due to the volatility of natural gas and oil prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december   and  the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of billion  a liability of million and an asset of million  respectively 
the derivatives that we acquired in our cnr acquisition represented million  million and million of liability at december   and natural gas and oil properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the natural gas and oil industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for natural gas and oil business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of natural gas and oil properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of natural gas and oil properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher natural gas and oil depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
under the full cost method  capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved natural gas and oil reserves 
if we maintain the same level of production year over year  the depreciation  depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 
we review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues adjusted for cash flow hedges less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
as of december   capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceeded the estimated present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves  net of related income tax considerations  resulting in a write down in the carrying value of natural gas and oil properties of billion 
in calculating future net revenues  current prices and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 
such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts  including the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges 
based on spot prices for natural gas and oil as of december   these cash flow hedges increased the full cost ceiling by billion  thereby reducing the ceiling test write down by the same amount 
two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 

table of contents any excess of the net book value  less deferred income taxes  is generally written off as an expense 
under sec regulations  the excess above the ceiling is not expensed or is reduced if  subsequent to the end of the period  but prior to the release of the financial statements  natural gas and oil prices increase sufficiently such that an excess above the ceiling would have been eliminated or reduced if the increased prices were used in the calculations 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates 
our internal petroleum reservoir engineers evaluated and estimated all of our proved reserves as of december   and independent petroleum engineers audited approximately of our estimated proved reserves by volume 
in addition  our internal engineers review and update our reserves on a quarterly basis 
all reserve estimates are prepared based upon a review of production histories and other geologic  economic  ownership and engineering data we developed 
additional information about our year end reserve evaluation is included under natural gas and oil reserves in item business 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
if a natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  b exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or c we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our 
table of contents ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of million 
fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
guidance is also provided regarding de recognition  classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions 
based on this guidance  we regularly analyze tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold condition prescribed under fin tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold condition are considered uncertain tax positions 
we accrue interest related to these uncertain tax positions which is recognized in interest expense 
penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses 
additional information about uncertain tax positions appears in income taxes in item business 
accounting for business combinations 
our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas  accounting for business combinations 
the accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at its purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given  whether in the form of cash  assets  stock or the assumption of liabilities 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
we believe that the consideration we have paid for our natural gas and oil property acquisitions has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of purchase 
consequently  we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our natural gas and oil property acquisitions  nor do we expect to recognize goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future 
disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties since chesapeake was founded in  our ceo  aubrey k 
mcclendon  has acquired working interests in virtually all of our natural gas and oil properties by participating in our drilling activities under the terms of the founder well participation program fwpp and predecessor participation arrangements provided for in mr 
mcclendon s employment agreements 
under the fwpp  approved by our shareholders in june  mr 
mcclendon may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of chesapeake during a calendar year  but he is not allowed to participate only in selected wells 
a participation election is required to be received by the compensation committee of chesapeake s board of directors not less than days prior to the start of each calendar year 
his participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the fwpp  which  among other things  limits his individual participation to a maximum working interest of in a well and prohibits participation in situations where chesapeake s working interest would be reduced below as a result of his participation 
in addition  the company is reimbursed for costs associated with leasehold acquired by mr 
mcclendon as a result of his well participation 

table of contents on december   we entered into a new five year employment agreement with mr 
mcclendon that contained a one time well cost incentive award to him 
the total cost of the award to chesapeake was million plus employment taxes in the amount of approximately million 
we will recognize the incentive award as general and administrative expense over the five year vesting period for the clawback described below  resulting in an expense of approximately million per year beginning in in addition to state and federal income tax withholding  similar employment taxes were imposed on mr 
mcclendon and withheld from the award 
the net incentive award of approximately million can only be applied against costs attributable to interests in company wells acquired by mr 
mcclendon or his affiliates under the fwpp 
the incentive award is subject to a clawback if  during the initial five year term of the employment agreement  mr 
mcclendon resigns from the company or is terminated for cause by the company 
upon receipt of the company s monthly invoice for joint interest billings in mid january  mr 
mcclendon elected to apply approximately million of the drilling credit against his december fwpp joint interest billings  leaving million available as a credit against future billings 
based on our current development plans and mr 
mcclendon s election under the fwpp to participate with a working interest during  the well costs under the fwpp are expected to exceed the amount of the entire fwpp credit in early we refer you to the discussion of the fwpp and mr 
mcclendon s employment agreement contained in our proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders  which discussion is incorporated by reference in part iii of this report 
as disclosed in note  in  chesapeake had revenues of billion from natural gas and oil sales to eagle energy partners i  lp  a former affiliated entity

in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
fsp apb clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon either mandatory or optional conversion including partial cash settlement are not addressed by paragraph of apb opinion no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
the accounting prescribed by fsp apb increases the amount of 
table of contents interest expense required to be recognized with respect to such instruments and  thus  lowers reported net income and net income per share of issuers of such instruments

we have three debt series that will be affected by the guidance  our contingent convertible senior notes due  our contingent convertible senior notes due and our contingent convertible senior notes due this staff position is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  and must be applied on a retrospective basis 
the initial adoption of fsp apb is expected to decrease the carrying value of our contingent convertible senior notes by approximately billion  increase shareholders equity by approximately million and increase deferred tax liabilities by approximately million 
in addition  we currently estimate that we will record additional non cash interest expense  which will reduce our pre tax income by approximately million and reduce net income by approximately million for the year ended december  in june  the fasb issued fsp emerging issues task force eitf no

in october  the fasb issued fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
fsp fas clarifies the application of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
this fsp could be applicable to us but we currently have no financial assets of this type 
on december   the securities and exchange commission sec adopted major revisions to its rules governing oil and gas company reporting requirements 
these include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves and that allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors 
the current rules limit disclosure to only proved reserves 
the new disclosure requirements also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of the person primarily responsible for the preparation or audit of reserve estimates  and to file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare or audit reserves estimates 
the new rules also require that oil and gas reserves be reported and the full cost ceiling value calculated using an average price based upon the prior month period 
the new oil and gas reporting requirements are effective for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december   with early adoption not permitted 
we are in the process of assessing the impact of these new requirements on our financial position  results of operations and financial disclosures

we urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk natural gas and oil hedging activities our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   our natural gas and oil derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  basis protection swaps  knockout swaps  cap swaps  call options  put options and collars 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas and oil prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
for swap instruments  chesapeake receives a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pays a floating market price to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 

table of contents basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential for natural gas or oil from a specified delivery point 
for mid continent basis protection swaps  which typically have negative differentials to nymex  chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract 
for appalachian basin basis protection swaps  which typically have positive differentials to nymex  chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract 
for knockout swaps  chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for the possibility to reduce the counterparty s exposure to zero  in any given month  if the floating market price is lower than certain pre determined knockout prices 
for cap swaps  chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterparty s exposure 
in other words  there is no limit to chesapeake s exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty 
for call options  chesapeake receives a premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a call option 
if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option  chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess 
if the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option  no payment is due from chesapeake 
for put options  chesapeake receives a premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a put option 
if the market price falls below the fixed price of the put option  chesapeake pays the counterparty such shortfall 
if the market price settles above the fixed price of the put option  no payment is due from chesapeake 
collars contain a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap 
under the counter swap  chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty 
the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap 
we refer to this locked in value as a locked swap 
generally  at the time chesapeake enters into a counter swap  chesapeake removes the original swap s designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge under sfas the reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows 
instead  the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain or loss that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in natural gas and oil prices 
any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 to the extent that a legal right of set off exists  chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
gains or losses from certain derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains losses are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production 
pursuant to sfas  certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity ie  temporary fluctuations in value are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains losses within natural gas and oil sales 
following provisions of sfas  changes in the fair value of 
table of contents derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales as unrealized gains losses 
the components of natural gas and oil sales for the years ended december   and are presented below

the options are callable by the counterparty in march and march and  mmbtu day at mmbtu  callable by the counterparty in december b we assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with our acquisition of columbia natural resources  llc in november in accordance with sfas  these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price 
table of contents allocation as a liability of million million liability remaining as of december  
the recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired 
because of this accounting treatment  only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our natural gas and oil revenues upon settlement 
for example  if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change  then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions  cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to natural gas and oil revenues related to the derivative positions 
if  however  the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation  the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in natural gas and oil revenues  depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower  respectively  than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation 
for accounting purposes  the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes at market prices on the date of our acquisition of cnr 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendment of sfas on derivative instruments and hedging activities  the derivative instruments assumed in connection with the cnr acquisition are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows for the periods in which settlement occurs 
we have established the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices  volatility curves and discount factors 
these estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness 
derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations 
such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments  but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives 
the values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions and other factors 
based upon the market prices at december   we expect to transfer approximately million net of income taxes of the gain included in the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months in the related month of production 
all transactions hedged as of december  are expected to mature by december  additional information concerning the fair value of our natural gas and oil derivative instruments is as follows in millions fair value of contracts outstanding  as of january change in fair value of contracts fair value of contracts when entered into contracts realized or otherwise settled fair value of contracts when closed fair value of contracts outstanding  as of december the change in the fair value of our derivative instruments since january  resulted from new contracts entered into  the settlement of derivatives for a realized gain  as well as a decrease in natural gas and oil prices 
derivative instruments reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet represent the estimated fair value of derivative instrument settlements scheduled to occur over the subsequent twelve month period based on market prices for natural gas and oil as of the consolidated balance sheet date 
the derivative settlement amounts are not due and payable until the month in which the related underlying hedged transaction occurs 

table of contents interest rate risk the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

years of maturity thereafter total in millions liabilities long term debt fixed rate a average interest rate long term debt variable rate average interest rate a this amount does not include the discount included in long term debt of million and interest rate derivatives of million 
changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
all of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
however  changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt 
interest rate derivatives we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates 
for interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets liabilities  and the debt s carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense 
gains or losses from interest rate derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains losses included in interest expense were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
pursuant to sfas  certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as fair value hedges 
changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity ie  temporary fluctuations in value are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains losses within interest expense

the remaining million was from interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the related senior notes ranging from five to twelve years 
foreign currency derivatives on december   we issued million of euro denominated senior notes due concurrent with the issuance of the euro denominated senior notes  we entered into a cross currency swap to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes 
under the terms of the cross currency swap  on each semi annual interest payment date  the counterparties will pay chesapeake million and chesapeake will pay the counterparties million  which will yield an annual dollar equivalent interest rate of 
upon maturity of the notes  the counterparties will pay chesapeake million and chesapeake will pay the counterparties million 
the terms of the cross currency swap were based on the dollar euro exchange rate on the issuance date of to 
through the cross currency swap  we have eliminated any potential variability in chesapeake s expected cash flows related to changes in foreign exchange rates and therefore the swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge under sfas the euro denominated debt is recorded in notes payable million at december  using an exchange rate of to 
the fair value of the cross currency swap is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability of million at december
