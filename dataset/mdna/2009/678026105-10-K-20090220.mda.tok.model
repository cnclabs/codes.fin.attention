our business strategy we have in past years grown our business lines both organically and through strategic acquisitions 
our investments are focused in growth areas and on areas where we can expand market share and where we can achieve attractive returns 
currently  we see opportunities in the oil sands developments in canada and in the expansion of our capabilities to manufacture and assemble deepwater capital equipment 
current economic conditions have led us to emphasize appropriate reductions in our capital spending and operating expenses consistent with the decline in demand for our services as producers curtail their drilling activity in response to reduced commodity price expectations 
as part of our long term growth strategy  we continue to review complementary acquisitions as well as capital expenditures to enhance our ability to increase cash flows from our existing assets 
for additional discussion of our business strategy  please read item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions and capital spending since the completion of our initial public offering in february  we have completed acquisitions for total consideration of million 
acquisitions of other oilfield service businesses have been an important aspect of our growth strategy and plans to increase shareholder value 
our acquisition strategy has primarily been focused in the well site services segment where we have expanded our geographic locations and our product and service offerings  especially in our rental tool business line 
this growth strategy has allowed us to leverage our existing and acquired product and service offerings in new geographic locations 
we have also made strategic acquisitions in offshore products  tubular services and in other well site services business lines

our industry we operate in the oilfield services industry and provide a broad range of products and services to our customers through our offshore products  tubular services and well site services business segments 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry  particularly our customers willingness to spend capital on oil and natural gas exploration and development activities 
management estimates that approximately to of the company s revenues are dependent on north american natural gas drilling and completion activity with a significant amount of such revenues being derived from lower margin octg sales 
as such  we estimate that our profitability is fairly evenly balanced between oil driven activity and natural gas driven activity 
demand for our products and services by our customers is highly sensitive to current and expected future oil and natural gas prices 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for financial information by segment and a geographical breakout of revenues and long lived assets 
our financial results reflect the cyclical nature of the oilfield services business 
since  there have been periods of increasing and decreasing activity in each of our operating segments 
the current sustained declines in oil and gas prices  particularly in combination with the constrained capital and credit markets and overall economic downturn  has resulted in a decline in activity by customers in each of our segments during the first quarter of for additional information on how each of our segments have responded to declines in oil and natural gas prices  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our well site services businesses  which are significantly affected by the north american rig count  saw increasing activity from through  had relatively flat year over year activity in and again saw an overall increase in activity for the year  but saw declines beginning in the fourth quarter of which have continued into acquisitions and capital expenditures made in this segment have created growth opportunities 
in addition  increased activity supporting oil sands developments in northern alberta  canada by our work force accommodations  catering and logistics business has had a positive impact on this segment s overall trends 
our offshore products segment  which is more influenced by deepwater development activity and rig and vessel construction and repair  experienced decreased activity during  however  backlog increased significantly from to  which resulted in improved operating results during   and in however  new order activity slowed in the latter part of our tubular services business is influenced by us drilling activity similar to our well site services and has historically been our most cyclical business segment 
in addition  during and  this segment s margins were positively affected in a significant manner by increasing prices for steel products  including the octg we sell 
prices for steel products remained comparatively stable during  declined in and then increased in subsequent to december   octg prices have weakened 
well site services overview during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue and of our operating income  before corporate charges  from our well site services segment 
our well site services segment includes a broad range of products and services that are used to establish and maintain the flow of oil and gas from a well throughout its lifecycle and to accommodate personnel in remote locations 
our operations include land drilling services  work force accommodations and associated services and rental tools 
we use our fleet of drilling rigs  rental equipment and work force accommodation facilities to serve our customers at well sites and project development locations 
our products and services are used in both onshore and offshore applications throughout the exploration  development and production phases of a well s life 
additionally  our work force accommodations and 
table of contents associated services are employed to support work forces in the oil sands and a variety of mining and related natural resource applications as well as forest fire fighting and disaster relief efforts 
well site services market demand for our drilling rigs  rental equipment and work force accommodations and associated services has historically been tied to the level of activity by oil and gas explorationists and producers 
the primary driver for this activity is the price of oil and natural gas 
activity levels have been  and we expect will continue to be  highly correlated with hydrocarbon commodity prices 
demand for our workforce accommodations business has grown in recent years due to the increasing demand for accommodations to support workers in the oil sands region of canada 
however  full utilization of additional capacity as a result of our current and future expansions of our accommodations facilities will largely depend on continued oil sands developments 
because costs for production from oil sands may be substantially higher than costs to produce conventional crude oil  the recent decline in crude oil prices has made certain oil sands projects less profitable or uneconomic 
if crude oil prices remain at their current levels or decline further  oil sands producers may cancel or delay plans to expand their facilities  as some oil sands producers have already done 
products and services drilling services 
our drilling services business is located in the united states and provides land drilling services for shallow to medium depth wells ranging from  to  feet

backlog 
backlog in our offshore products segment was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  we expect in excess of of our backlog at december  to be completed in our offshore products backlog consists of firm customer purchase orders for which contractual commitments exist and delivery is scheduled 
in some instances  these purchase orders are cancelable by the customer  subject to the payment of termination fees and or the reimbursement of our costs incurred 
although our backlog is an important indicator of future offshore products shipments and revenues  backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period 
we believe that the offshore construction and development business is characterized by lengthy projects and a long lead time order cycle 
the change in backlog levels from one period to the next does not necessarily evidence a long term trend 
regions of operations our offshore products segment provides products and services to customers in the major offshore oil and gas producing regions of the world  including the gulf of mexico  west africa  azerbaijan  the north sea  brazil and southeast asia

customers and competitors we market our products and services to a broad customer base  including the direct end users  engineering and design companies  prime contractors  and at times  our competitors through outsourcing arrangements 
tubular services overview during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue and of our operating income  before corporate charges  from our tubular services segment 
through this segment  we distribute 
table of contents octg and provide associated octg finishing and logistics services to the oil and gas industry 
octg consist of downhole casing and production tubing 
through our tubular services segment  we distribute a broad range of casing and tubing  provide threading  remediation  logistical and inventory management services  and offer e commerce pricing  ordering  tracking and financial reporting capabilities 
we serve a customer base ranging from major oil and gas companies to small independents 
through our key relationships with more than domestic and foreign manufacturers and related service providers and suppliers of octg  we deliver tubular products and ancillary services to oil and gas companies  drilling contractors and consultants predominantly in the united states 
the octg distribution market is highly fragmented and competitive  and is focused in the united states 
we purchase tubular goods from a variety of sources 
however  during  we purchased from a single domestic supplier of the total tubular goods we purchased and from three domestic suppliers approximately of such tubular goods 
since the fourth quarter of  we have reduced our forward purchase commitments for octg considering the decline in drilling activity 
octg market our tubular services segment primarily distributes casing and tubing 
casing forms the structural wall in oil and gas wells to provide support  control pressure and prevent caving during drilling operations 
casing is also used to protect water bearing formations during the drilling of a well 
casing is generally not removed after it has been installed in a well 
production tubing  which is used to bring oil and gas to the surface  may be replaced during the life of a producing well 
a key indicator of domestic demand for octg is the aggregate footage of wells drilled onshore and offshore in the united states 
the octg market is also affected by the level of inventories maintained by manufacturers  distributors and end users 
inventory on the ground  when at high levels  can cause tubular sales to lag a rig count increase due to inventory destocking 
demand for tubular products is positively impacted by increased drilling of deeper  horizontal and offshore wells 
deeper wells require incremental tubular footage and enhanced mechanical capabilities to ensure the integrity of the well 
premium tubulars are used in horizontal drilling to withstand the increased bending and compression loading associated with a horizontal well 
operators typically specify premium tubulars for the completion of offshore wells 
products and services tubular products and services 
we distribute various types of octg produced by both domestic and foreign manufacturers to major and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies and other octg distributors 
we do not manufacture any of the tubular goods that we distribute 
as a result  gross margins in this segment are generally lower than those reported by our other segments 
we operate our tubular services segment from a total of eight offices and facilities located near areas of oil and gas exploration and development activity 
we have distribution relationships with most major domestic and certain international steel mills 
in this business  inventory management is critical to our success 
we maintain on the ground inventory in approximately yards located in the united states  giving us the flexibility to fill customer orders from our own stock or directly from the manufacturer 
we have a proprietary inventory management system  designed specifically for the octg industry  which enables us to track our product shipments

independent third party inspection companies operate within each of these facilities 
tubular products and services sales arrangements 
we provide our tubular products and logistics services through a variety of arrangements  including spot market sales and alliances 
we provide some of our tubular products and services to independent and major oil and gas companies under alliance or program arrangements 
although our alliances are generally not as profitable as the spot market and can be cancelled by the customer  they provide us with more stable and predictable revenues and an improved ability to forecast required inventory levels  which allows us to manage our inventory more efficiently 
regions of operations our tubular services segment provides tubular products and services principally to customers in the united states both for land and offshore applications 
however  we also sell a small percentage for export worldwide 
customers  suppliers and competitors our largest end user customer in the tubular distribution market in was chesapeake energy corporation 
our largest suppliers were us steel group and tenaris global services usa corporation 
although we have a leading market share position in tubular services distribution  the market is highly fragmented 
our main competitors in tubular distribution are premier pipe lp  mcjunkin red man corporation formerly red man pipe supply co  inc  bourland leverich supply company  lc and pipeco services 
seasonality of operations our operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate  most notably in canada  the rocky mountain region and the gulf of mexico 
a portion of our canadian work force accommodations  catering and logistics operations is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for exploration and production activity to occur 
the spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the spring months and  as a result  adversely affects our operations and sales of products and services in the second quarter 
our operations in the gulf of mexico are also affected by weather patterns 
weather conditions in the gulf coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring  summer and fall months with the lowest activity in the winter months 
as a result of these seasonal differences  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
in addition  summer and fall drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast 
for example  during  a significant disruption occurred in oil and gas drilling and production operations in the us gulf of mexico due to damage inflicted by hurricanes katrina and rita and  during  from hurricane ike 
employees as of december   we had  full time employees  of whom are in our offshore products segment  of whom are in our well site services segment  of whom are in our tubular services segment and of whom are in our corporate headquarters 
we are party to collective bargaining agreements covering  employees located in canada  the united kingdom and argentina as of december  we believe relations with our employees are good 

table of contents government regulation our business is significantly affected by foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry  worker safety and environmental protection 
changes in these laws  including more stringent regulations and increased levels of enforcement of these laws and regulations  could significantly affect our business 
we cannot predict changes in the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how these laws and regulations may be interpreted or the effect changes in these laws and regulations may have on us or our future operations or earnings 
we also are not able to predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted 
we depend on the demand for our products and services from oil and natural gas companies 
this demand is affected by changing taxes  price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally  including those specifically directed to oilfield and offshore operations 
the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas in our areas of operation could also adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products and services 
we cannot determine the extent to which our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in existing regulations or enforcement 
some of our employees who perform services on offshore platforms and vessels are covered by the provisions of the jones act  the death on the high seas act and general maritime law 
these laws operate to make the liability limits established under states workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and permit them or their representatives generally to pursue actions against us for damages or job related injuries with no limitations on our potential liability 
our operations are subject to numerous foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the release and or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws  for which compliance is often costly and difficult 
the violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits  issuance of corrective action orders  modification or cessation of operations  assessment of administrative and civil penalties  and even criminal prosecution 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
further  we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
however  there can be no assurance that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non compliance will not be incurred in the future 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies or more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations  could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify 
we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  and comparable state statutes 
the united states environmental protection agency  or epa  and state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for some types of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes 
some wastes handled by us in our field service activities that currently are exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes 
this would subject us to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements 
with regard to our us operations  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla  also know as the superfund law  and comparable state statutes impose liability  without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct  on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that transported  disposed of  or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently have operations in the united states on properties where activities involving the handling of hazardous substances or wastes may have been conducted prior to our operations on such properties or by third parties whose operations were not under our control 
these properties may 
table of contents be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under these laws and related regulations  we could be required to remove or remediate previously discarded hazardous substances and wastes or property contamination that was caused by these third parties 
these laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed 
in the course of our domestic operations  some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and gas deposits  and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials or norm 
norm wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements  and any storage vessels  piping  and work area affected by norm may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements 
because many of the properties presently or previously owned  operated  or occupied by us have been used for oil and gas production operations for many years  it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of norm 
the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited unless the discharge is permitted by the epa or applicable state agencies 
many of our domestic properties and operations require permits for discharges of wastewater and or stormwater  and we have a system for securing and maintaining these permits 
in addition  the oil pollution act of imposes a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages  including natural resource damages  resulting from such spills in waters of the united states 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility or vessel  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws provide for administrative  civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and  together with the oil pollution act  impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning  as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation  and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges 
some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants 
the federal clean air act and analogous state laws require permits for facilities in the united states that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality 
failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties 
recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
in response to such studies  many foreign nations  including canada  have agreed to limit emissions of these gases pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change  also known as the kyoto protocol 
in december  canada ratified the kyoto protocol 
the kyoto protocol requires canada to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases to below levels by the implementation of the kyoto protocol in canada is expected to affect the operation of all industries in canada  including the oilfield service industry and its customers in the oil and natural gas industry 
on april   the government of canada released its action plan to reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution the action plan also known as ecoaction which includes the regulatory framework for air emissions 
this action plan covers not only large industry  but regulates the fuel efficiency of vehicles and strengthens energy standards for a number of products 
on march   the government of canada released details of the action plan s regulatory framework  which includes a requirement that all covered industrial sectors  including upstream oil and gas facilities meeting certain threshold requirement  reduce their emissions from levels by by the government of canada is in the process of developing regulations to implement the action plan 
the government of canada and the province of alberta also released on january  the final report of the canada alberta ecoenergy carbon capture and storage task force  which made several recommendations  including i incorporating a role for carbon capture and storage in meeting emissions reductions goals  ii allocating new funding for carbon capture and storage projects through a competitive process  and iii clarifying regulatory jurisdiction and long term liability issues associated with carbon capture and storage 
as precise details of the implementation of the action plan have not yet been finalized  the effect on our operations in canada cannot be determined at this time 
it is possible that already stringent air emissions regulations 
table of contents applicable to our operations and the operations of our customers in canada will be replaced with even stricter requirements prior to these requirements could increase our and our customers cost of doing business  reduce the demand for the oil and gas our customers produce  and thus have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and services 
although the united states is not participating in the kyoto protocol  the us congress is considering climate change related legislation to restrict greenhouse gas emissions 
president obama has expressed support for legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases 
in addition  more than one third of the states  either individually or through multi state regional initiatives  already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
in  the western climate initiative  which is comprised of a number of western states  including the state of utah  and canadian provinces issued a greenhouse gas reduction goal statement in which it announced a goal to collectively reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions to below levels by additionally  the state of new mexico recently enacted greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements 
depending on the particular program  our customers could be required to purchase and surrender allowances  either for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from their operations or from combustion of fuels such as oil or natural gas they produce  prepare an inventory of their emissions  or pay a tax on their greenhouse gas emissions 
a stringent greenhouse gas control program could have an adverse effect on our customers cost of doing business and could reduce demand for the oil and gas they produce and thus have an adverse affect on the demand for our products and services 
also  as a result of the us supreme court s decision on april  in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  the epa may be required to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks even if congress does not adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases 
the court s holding in massachusetts that greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide fall under the federal clean air act s definition of air pollutant may also result in future regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under certain clean air act programs 
in july  the epa released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act  in response to the supreme court s decision in massachusetts 
in the notice  the epa evaluated the potential regulation of greenhouse gases under the clean air act and other potential methods of regulating greenhouse gases 
although the notice did not propose any specific  new regulatory requirements for greenhouse gases  it indicates that federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could occur in the near future even if congress does not adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases 
new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide that may be imposed in areas of the united states in which we conduct business could also adversely affect our cost of doing business and demand for oil and gas and thus demand for our products and services 
our operations outside of the united states are potentially subject to similar foreign governmental controls relating to protection of the environment 
we believe that  to date  our operations outside of the united states have been in substantial compliance with existing requirements of these foreign governmental bodies and that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
however  this trend of compliance may not continue in the future or the cost of such compliance may become material 
for instance  any future restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases that are imposed in foreign countries in which we operate  such as in canada  pursuant to the kyoto protocol or other locally enforceable requirements could adversely affect demand for our services 
item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a number of economic risks as widely reported  financial markets worldwide have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months  including  among other things  extreme volatility in securities prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions that include severely restricted credit and 
table of contents declines in real estate values 
while  currently  these conditions have not impaired our ability to finance our operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets 
the global economy has slowed and there has been substantial uncertainty in the capital markets 
these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways 
the current tightening of credit in financial markets and slowing economy adversely affects the ability of customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant operations  has resulted in lower demand for our products and services  and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders included in our backlog and adversely affect the collectability of receivables 
additionally  the current tightening of credit in financial markets coupled with the slowing economy could negatively impact our ability to grow and cost of capital 
our business is also adversely affected when energy demand is lowered due to decreases in the general level of economic activity  such as decreases in business and consumer spending and travel  which results in lower energy prices  and therefore  less oilfield activity and lower demand for our products and services 
these conditions could have an adverse effect on our operating results and the ability to recover our assets at their stated values 
likewise  our suppliers may be unable to sustain their current level of operations  fulfill their commitments and or fund future operations and obligations  each of which could adversely affect our operations 
strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against certain major currencies such as the euro  the british pound and the canadian dollar and other currencies could also adversely affect our results 
most of these events have occurred to some degree thus far in the current recession 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries or their ultimate impact on our company 
decreased oil and gas industry expenditure levels will adversely affect our results of operations 
demand for our products and services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration  development and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies  including national oil companies 
if our customers expenditures decline  our business will suffer 
the industry s willingness to explore  develop and produce depends largely upon the availability of attractive drilling prospects and the prevailing view of future product prices 
prices for oil and natural gas have declined precipitously recently and are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control 
a sudden or long term decline in product pricing similar to what we are experiencing currently will materially adversely affect our results of operations 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress levels of exploration  development  and production activity  often reflected as reductions in rig counts 
we have experienced a significant decline in utilization of our drilling rigs in late and thus far in oil and gas prices have also declined from record highs reached in we currently expect that decreased energy prices and drilling will also negatively impact our other well site services businesses and tubular services business in such lower activity levels are expected to materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability and could result in an impairment of our asset carrying values 
additionally  significant new regulatory requirements  including climate change legislation  could have an impact on the demand for and the cost of producing oil and gas 
many factors affect the supply and demand for oil and gas and therefore influence product prices  including the level of drilling activity  the level of production  the levels of oil and gas inventories  depletion rates  the worldwide demand for oil and gas  the expected cost of developing new reserves  delays in major offshore and onshore oil and gas field development timetables  the actual cost of finding and producing oil and gas  the availability of attractive oil and gas field prospects which may be affected by governmental actions or environmental activists which may restrict drilling  
table of contents the availability of transportation infrastructure  refining capacity and shifts in end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas  global weather conditions and natural disasters  worldwide economic activity including growth in underdeveloped countries  including china and india  national government political requirements  including the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting companies opec to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil and government policies which could nationalize or expropriate oil and gas exploration  production  refining or transportation assets  the level of oil and gas production by non opec countries  the impact of armed hostilities involving one or more oil producing nations  rapid technological change and the timing and extent of alternative energy sources  including liquefied natural gas lng or other alternative fuels  environmental regulation  and domestic and foreign tax policies 
our business may be adversely affected by extended periods of low oil prices or unsuccessful exploration results may decrease deepwater exploration and production activity or oil sands development and production in canada 
our offshore products segment depends on exploration and production expenditures in deepwater areas 
because deepwater projects are more capital intensive and take longer to generate first production than shallow water and onshore projects  the economic analyses conducted by exploration and production companies typically assume lower prices for production from such projects to determine economic viability over the long term 
the economic analyses conducted by exploration and production companies for very large oil sands developments are similar to those performed for deepwater projects with respect to oil price assumptions 
if crude oil prices remain at their current levels or decline further  oil sands producers may cancel or delay plans to expand their facilities  which would adversely impact demand for our well site services segment 
for example  in november  one of our customers announced the suspension of all activities associated with a development project in the canadian oil sands during and amended its contract with us relating to the construction and rental of a  bed facility 
for more information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
perceptions of longer term lower oil prices by these companies can reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability in our offshore products segment and our well site services segment 
because the oil and gas industry is cyclical  our operating results may fluctuate 
oil prices  which have dropped precipitously in the last six months after reaching historical highs  have been and are expected to remain volatile 
this volatility causes oil and gas companies and drilling contractors to change their strategies and expenditure levels 
we have experienced in the past  and expect to experience in  significant fluctuations in operating results based on these changes 
the cyclical nature of our business and a severe prolonged downturn could negatively affect the value of our goodwill 
as of december   goodwill represented approximately of our total assets 
we have recorded goodwill because we paid more for some of our businesses than the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets of those businesses 
current accounting standards  which were effective january   require a periodic review of goodwill for impairment in value and a non cash charge against earnings with a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity if circumstances  some of which are beyond our control  indicate that the carrying amount will not be recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment of a portion of our goodwill totaling million as a result of several factors affecting our tubular services and drilling 
table of contents reporting units 
it is possible that we could recognize additional goodwill impairment charges if  among other factors global economic conditions deteriorate further than those conditions that existed at december   the outlook for future profits and cash flow for any of our reporting units deteriorate as the result of many possible factors  including  but not limited to  increased or unanticipated competition  further reductions in customer capital spending plans  loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory judgment s  future operating losses at a reporting unit  downward forecast revisions  or restructuring plans  costs of equity or debt capital increase further  or valuations for comparable public companies or comparable acquisition valuations deteriorate further 
the level and pricing of tubular goods imported into the united states could decrease demand for our tubular goods inventory and adversely impact our results of operations 
also  if steel mills were to sell a substantial amount of goods directly to end users in the united states  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
lower cost tubular goods from a number of foreign countries are imported into the us tubular goods market 
if the level of imported lower cost tubular goods were to otherwise increase  our tubular services segment could be adversely affected to the extent that we then have higher cost tubular goods in inventory or if prices and margins are driven down by increased supplies of tubular goods 
if prices were to decrease significantly  we might not be able to profitably sell our inventory of tubular goods 
in addition  significant price decreases could result in a longer holding period for some of our inventory  which could also have a material adverse effect on our tubular services segment 
we do not manufacture any of the tubular goods that we distribute 
historically  users of tubular goods in the united states  in contrast to outside the united states  have purchased tubular goods through distributors 
if customers were to purchase tubular goods directly from steel mills  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
if we were to lose a significant supplier of our tubular goods  we could be adversely affected 
during  we purchased from a single domestic supplier approximately of the total tubular goods we distributed and purchased from three domestic suppliers approximately of such tubular goods 
we do not have contracts with all of these suppliers 
if we were to lose any of these suppliers or if production at one or more of the suppliers were interrupted  our tubular services segment and our overall business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if the extent of the loss or interruption were sufficiently large  the impact on us would be material 
our operations may suffer due to increased industry wide capacity of certain types of equipment or assets 
the demand for and pricing of certain types of our assets and equipment  particularly our drilling rigs and some of our rental tool assets  is subject to the overall availability of such assets in the marketplace 
if demand for our assets were to decrease  or to the extent that we and our competitors increase our fleets in excess of current demand  we may encounter decreased pricing or utilization for our assets and services  which could adversely impact our operations and profits 
currently  we are experiencing certain of these effects as demand has declined and pricing pressures have increased 
in addition  we have significantly increased our accommodations capacity in the oil sands region over the past four years based on our expectation for current and future customer demand for accommodations in the area 
should our customers build their own facilities to meet their accommodations needs or our competitors likewise increase their available accommodations  demand for our accommodations could decrease  negatively impacting the profitability of our well site services segment 

table of contents development of permanent infrastructure in the oil sands region could negatively impact our accommodations business 
our accommodations business specializes in providing housing and personnel logistics for work forces in remote areas which lack the infrastructure typically available in nearby towns and cities 
if permanent towns  cities and municipal infrastructure develop in the oil sands region of alberta  canada  the demand for our accommodations could decrease as customer employees move to the region and choose to utilize permanent housing and food services 
we do business in international jurisdictions whose political and regulatory environments and compliance regimes differ from those in the united states 
a portion of our revenue is attributable to operations in foreign countries 
these activities accounted for approximately excluding canada of our consolidated revenue in the year ended december  risks associated with our operations in foreign areas include  but are not limited to war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets  expropriation  confiscation or nationalization of assets  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts  foreign exchange restrictions  foreign currency fluctuations  foreign taxation  the inability to repatriate earnings or capital  changing political conditions  changing foreign and domestic monetary policies  social  political  military and economic situations in foreign areas where we do business and the possibilities of war  other armed conflict or terrorist attacks  and regional economic downturns 
additionally  in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
these regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete 
our international business operations also include projects in countries where governmental corruption has been known to exist and where our competitors who are not subject to united states laws and regulations  such as the foreign corrupt practices act  can gain competitive advantages over us by securing business awards  licenses or other preferential treatment in those jurisdictions using methods that united states law and regulations prohibit us from using 
for example  our non us competitors are not subject to the anti bribery restrictions of the foreign corrupt practices act  which make it illegal to give anything of value to foreign officials or employees or agents of nationally owned oil companies in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage 
we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business  licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence 
violations of these laws could result in monetary and criminal penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and  therefore  our ability to do business 
we might be unable to employ a sufficient number of technical personnel 
many of the products that we sell  especially in our offshore products segment  are complex and highly engineered and often must perform in harsh conditions 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain technical personnel with the ability to design  utilize and enhance these products 
in addition  our 
table of contents ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force 
during periods of increased activity  the demand for skilled workers is high  and the supply is limited 
through  we have experienced high demand and increased wages for labor forces serving our well site services segment  notably in our accommodations business in canada 
we saw significant increases in the wages paid by competing employers resulting in increases in the wage rates that we paid 
when these events occur  our cost structure increases and our growth potential could be impaired 
recently  with the decline in activity in the oil field service and manufacturing businesses generally  we are seeing less pressure on wages and improvement in our ability to attract and retain employees 
our inability to control the inherent risks of acquiring and integrating businesses could adversely affect our operations 
acquisitions have been  and our management believes acquisitions will continue to be  a key element of our business strategy 
we may not be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms in the future 
we may be required to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities in connection with such acquisitions 
such additional debt service requirements could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition 
the issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
we expect to gain certain business  financial and strategic advantages as a result of business combinations we undertake  including synergies and operating efficiencies 
our forward looking statements assume that we will successfully integrate our business acquisitions and realize the benefits of that 
an inability to realize expected strategic advantages as a result of the acquisition would negatively affect the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
additional risks we could face in connection with acquisitions include retaining key employees of acquired businesses  retaining and attracting new customers of acquired businesses  increased administrative burden  developing our sales and marketing capabilities  managing our growth effectively  potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition  integrating operations  operating a new line of business  and increased logistical problems common to large  expansive operations 
additionally  an acquisition may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have previously experienced 
if we fail to manage any of these risks successfully  our business could be harmed 
our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition  and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions 
we are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations that may require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations 
all of our operations  especially our drilling and offshore products businesses  are significantly affected by stringent and complex foreign  federal  provincial  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
we could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of  or conditions caused by  prior operators or other third parties 
environmental laws and regulations are subject to change in the future  possibly resulting in more stringent requirements 
if existing 
table of contents regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change or are more stringently enforced  we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures 
any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition  including the issuance of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations  reduction or cessation in operations  and performance of site investigatory  remedial or other corrective actions 
we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 
climate change is receiving ever increasing attention from scientists and legislators alike 
the debate is ongoing as to the extent to which our climate is changing  the potential causes of this change and its potential impacts 
some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
there are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions  which are in various phases of discussion or implementation 
the outcome of foreign  us federal  regional and state actions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations  additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities  or other regulatory actions 
these actions could result in increased costs associated with our operations and our customers operations  increase other costs to our business  impact overall drilling activity in the areas in which we operate  and reduce the demand for our services 
any adoption by us federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and implementation of the kyoto protocol by the government of canada could have far reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry 
although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  and could have a material adverse effect on our business or demand for our services 
see item government regulation for a more detailed description of our climate change related risks 
we may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities 
our operations are subject to many hazards 
we face the following risks under our insurance coverage we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  such as damages from environmental contamination or terrorist attacks  the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits  the counterparties to our insurance contracts may pose credit risks  and we may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage 
even a partially uninsured or underinsured claim  if successful and of significant size  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position 

table of contents we are subject to litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance 
in the ordinary course of business  we become the subject of various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations  products  employees and other matters  including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations 
some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have sold  and some relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired  even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses 
we maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses  and we are subject to various self retentions and deductibles under our insurance 
it is possible  however  that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters 
we might be unable to compete successfully with other companies in our industry 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and certain of them have relatively few barriers to entry 
the principal competitive factors in our markets are product and service quality and availability  responsiveness  experience  technology  equipment quality  reputation for safety and price 
in some of our business segments  we compete with the oil and gas industry s largest oilfield service providers 
these large national and multi national companies have longer operating histories  greater financial  technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do 
several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets 
in addition  we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements 
some contracts are awarded on a bid basis  which further increases competition based on price 
as a result of competition  we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services or to acquire additional business opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our concentration of customers in one industry may impact overall exposure to credit risk 
substantially all of our customers operate in the energy industry 
this concentration of customers in one industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables 
our common stock price has been volatile 
the market price of common stock of companies engaged in the oil and gas services industry has been highly volatile 
likewise  the market price of our common stock has varied significantly in the past  and we expect it to continue to remain highly volatile 
we may assume contractual risk in developing  manufacturing and delivering products in our offshore products business segment 
many of our products from our offshore products segment are ordered by customers under frame agreements or project specific contracts 
in some cases these contracts stipulate a fixed price for the delivery of our products and impose liquidated damages or late delivery fees if we do not meet specific customer deadlines 
in addition  the final delivered products may include customer and third party supplied equipment  the delay of which can negatively impact our ability to deliver our products on time at our anticipated profitability 
in certain cases these orders include new technology or unspecified design elements 
in some cases we may not be fully or properly compensated for the cost to develop and design the final products  negatively impacting our profitability on the projects 
in addition  our customers  in many cases  request changes to the original design or bid specifications for which we may not be fully or properly compensated 
as is customary for our offshore products segment  we agree to provide products under fixed price contracts  typically assuming responsibility for cost overruns 
our actual costs and any gross profit realized on these fixed 
table of contents price contracts may vary from the initially expected contract economics 
there is inherent risk in the estimation process and including significant unforeseen technical and logistical challenges or longer than expected lead times 
a fixed price contract may prohibit our ability to mitigate the impact of unanticipated increases in raw material prices including the price of steel through increased pricing 
depending on the size of a project  variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant impact on our operating results 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future revenues and earnings 
the revenues projected in our backlog may not be realized or  if realized  may not result in profits 
because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers projects  we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be realized 
in addition  even where a project proceeds as scheduled  it is possible that contracted parties may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us 
material delays  cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
reductions in our backlog due to cancellation by a customer or for other reasons would adversely affect  potentially to a material extent  the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog 
some of the contracts in our backlog are cancelable by the customer  subject to the payment of termination fees and or the reimbursement of our costs incurred 
we typically have no contractual right upon cancellation to the total revenues reflected in our backlog 
if we experience significant project terminations  suspensions or scope adjustments to contracts reflected in our backlog  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted 
we are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations 
our operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate  most notably in canada  the rocky mountain region and the gulf of mexico 
a portion of our canadian work force accommodations  catering and logistics operations is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for exploration and production activity to occur 
the spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the spring months and  as a result  adversely affects our operations and sales of products and services in the second and third quarters 
our operations in the gulf of mexico are also affected by weather patterns 
weather conditions in the gulf coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring  summer and fall months with the lowest activity in the winter months 
as a result of these seasonal differences  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
in addition  summer and fall drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast 
for example  during  a significant disruption occurred in oil and gas drilling and production operations in the us gulf of mexico due to damage inflicted by hurricanes katrina and rita and  during  from hurricane ike 
our oilfield operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses 
our operations are subject to the hazards inherent in the oilfield business 
these include  but are not limited to  equipment defects  blowouts  explosions  fires  collisions  capsizing and severe weather conditions 
these hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards as part of our ongoing business operations  we may agree to indemnify our customers against specific risks and liabilities 
while we maintain insurance protection against some of these risks  and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks  our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our offshore products and well site services segments  particularly our patents relating to our flexjoint technology and intervention tools utilized in the completion or workover of oil and gas wells 
the market success of our technologies will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce our proprietary rights in these technologies  to preserve rights in our trade secret and non public information  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
if any of our patents or other intellectual property rights are determined to be invalid or unenforceable  or if a court limits the scope of claims in a patent or fails to recognize our trade secret rights  our competitive advantages could be significantly reduced in the relevant technology  allowing competition for our customer base to increase 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the failure of our company to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could adversely affect our competitive position 
if we do not develop new competitive technologies and products  our business and revenues may be adversely affected 
the market for our offshore products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better performance in increasingly greater depths and harsher conditions 
if we are not able to design  develop and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology  our business and revenues will be adversely affected 
in addition  competitors or customers may develop new technology which addresses similar or improved solutions to our existing technology 
should our technology  particularly in offshore products or in our rental tool business  become the less attractive solution  our operations and profitability would be negatively impacted 
loss of key members of our management could adversely affect our business 
we depend on the continued employment and performance of key members of management 
if any of our key managers resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be materially adversely affected 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our officers 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and other counterparties  and a general increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by counterparties could have an adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations and financial condition 
risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties are a concern in our business 
we are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers and other counterparties  such as our lenders and insurers 
many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations  the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity 
in connection with the recent economic downturn  commodity prices have declined sharply  and the credit markets and availability of credit have been constrained 
additionally  many of our customers equity values have declined substantially 
the combination of lower cash flow due to commodity prices  a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve based credit facilities and the lack of available debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our customers liquidity and ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations to us 
furthermore  some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks  which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us 
any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties  either as a result of recent changes in financial and economic conditions or otherwise  could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could adversely affect our liquidity 

table of contents during periods of strong demand  we may be unable to obtain critical project materials on a timely basis 
our operations depend on our ability to procure on a timely basis certain project materials  such as forgings  to complete projects in an efficient manner 
our inability to procure critical materials during times of strong demand could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
employee and customer labor problems could adversely affect us 
we are party to collective bargaining agreements covering  employees in canada  employees in the united kingdom and employees in argentina 
in addition  our accommodations facilities serving oil sands development work in northern alberta  canada house both union and non union customer employees 
we have not experienced strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns in the recent past  but we cannot guarantee that we will not experience such events in the future 
a prolonged strike  work stoppage or other slowdown by our employees or by the employees of our customers could cause us to experience a disruption of our operations  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and  therefore  the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares for a premium 
provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  such as a classified board  limitations on the removal of directors  on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could increase the difficulty for a third party to acquire us  which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders ability to sell their shares of common stock at a premium

item legal proceedings we are a party to various pending or threatened claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations  products  employees and other matters  including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations 
some of these claims relate to matters occurring prior to our acquisition of businesses  and some relate to businesses we have sold
