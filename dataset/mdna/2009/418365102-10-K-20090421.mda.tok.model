table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview hastings is a leading multimedia entertainment retailer that that buys  sells  trades  and rents various home entertainment products  including books  music  software  periodicals  new and used cds  dvds  video games  video game consoles  and electronics 
we also offer consumables and trends products such as apparel  t shirts  action figures  posters  greeting cards  and seasonal merchandise through our entertainment stores and our internet web site 
as of january   we operated stores averaging approximately  square feet in medium sized markets located in states  primarily in the western and midwestern united states 
each of the stores  operated on leased premises  is wholly owned by us and is operated under the name of hastings 
our operating strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a multimedia entertainment retailer by expanding and remodeling existing stores  opening new stores in selected markets  and offering our products through our internet web site 
references herein to fiscal years are to the twelve month periods that end in january of the following calendar year 
for example  the twelve month period ended january  is referred to as fiscal critical accounting estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates comprise our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed  and any required adjustments are recorded  on a monthly or quarterly basis 
lower of cost or market for merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
as with any retailer  economic conditions  cyclical customer demand and changes in purchasing or distribution can affect the carrying value of inventory 
as circumstances warrant  we record the lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
in some instances  these adjustments can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in order to determine such adjustments  we evaluate the age  inventory turns and estimated fair value and returnability of merchandise inventory by product category and record an adjustment if estimated market value is below cost 

table of contents rental asset depreciation 
we have established rental asset depreciation policies that match rental product costs with the related revenues 
these policies require that we make significant estimates  based upon our experience  as to the ultimate revenue and the timing of the revenue to be generated from our rental product 
we utilize an accelerated method of depreciation because it approximates the pattern of demand for the product  which is higher when the product is initially released by the studios for rental and declines over time 
in establishing salvage values for our rental product  we consider the sales prices and sales volume of our previously rented product and other used product 
we currently depreciate the cost of our rental assets on an accelerated basis over six months or nine months  except for rental assets purchased for the initial stock of a new store  which are depreciated on a straight line basis over months 
rental assets  which include dvds  books on cd  and video games  are depreciated to salvage values ranging from to rental assets purchased for less than established salvage values are not depreciated 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expensed approximately  related to approximately  remaining vhs rental units in our stores 
we also review the carrying value of our rental assets to ensure that estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying value 
we periodically record adjustments to the value of previously rented product primarily for estimated obsolescence or excess product based upon changes in our original assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than our original estimates  additional adjustments  including adjustments to useful lives or salvage values  may be required 
we continually evaluate the estimates surrounding the useful lives and salvage values used in depreciating our rental assets 
changes to these estimates resulting from changes in consumer demand  changes in customer preferences or the price or availability of retail products may materially impact the carrying value of our rental assets and our rental margins 
the costs of rental product purchased pursuant to revenue sharing arrangements  which are recorded in rental cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations  typically include a lower initial product cost with a percentage of the net rental revenues to be shared with studios over an agreed period of time 
any up front costs exceeding the designated salvage value are amortized on an accelerated basis and revenue sharing payments pursuant to the applicable arrangement are expensed as the related revenue is earned 
additionally  certain titles have performance guarantees 
we analyze titles that are subject to performance guarantees and recognize an estimated expense for under performing titles throughout the applicable period based upon our analysis of the estimated shortfall 
we revise these estimates on a monthly basis  based on actual results 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate under performing stores on a quarterly basis to determine whether projected future cash flows over the remaining lease term are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the fixed asset investment in each individual store 
if projected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the fixed asset investment  an impairment charge is recognized if the fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets 
the carrying value of leasehold improvements as well as certain other property and equipment is subject to impairment write down 
income taxes 
in determining net income for financial statement purposes  we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for future income tax consequences that are attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their income tax bases 
we base the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities on enacted tax rates that we expect will apply to taxable earnings in the year when we expect to settle or recover those temporary differences 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities on any change in income tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date 
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood  on a cumulative basis  of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
share based compensation 
determining the amount of share based compensation to be recorded in the statement of earnings requires us to develop estimates that are used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions 
table of contents expected volatility the estimated stock price volatility is derived based upon our historical stock prices over the expected life of the option 
expected life of the option the estimate of an expected life is calculated based on historical data relating to grants  exercises  and cancellations  as well as the vesting period and contractual life of the option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option 
our stock price volatility and option lives involve management s best estimates at that time  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes pricing model and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of options that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
in addition to stock options  we award performance based stock awards 
the grant date fair value of performance based stock awards is equal to the average of the opening and closing stock price on the day on which they are granted 
compensation expense is recognized for these awards if management deems it probable that the performance conditions will be met 
management must use their judgment to determine the probability that a performance condition will be met 
if actual results differ from management s assumptions  future results could be materially impacted

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the prior year 
we believe the current financial crisis and its impact on consumer spending had a significant impact on our revenues during fiscal the following is a summary of our revenue results dollars in thousands fiscal year ended january  decrease percent of percent of revenues total revenues total dollar percent merchandise revenue rental revenue total revenues comparable store revenues total merchandise rental below is a summary of the comparable store revenues comp results for our eight largest merchandise categories fiscal year ended january  trends consumables electronics hard back caf books video games movies music trends comps increased compared to the prior year  driven by strong sales of webkinz plush products  as well as movie memorabilia products and sports apparel and merchandise 
consumables comps increased compared to the prior year due to strong sales across all categories 
consumable sales represented of total revenues for the year 
electronics comps increased primarily as a result of strong sales of blu ray dvd players  digital converter boxes  and third party gift cards  partially offset by lower sales of refurbished ipods and mp players 
books comps increased for the year resulting from strong sales of new and used trade paperback books  used hardback books  calendars  and books on cd  partially offset by lower sales of new hardback books 
top selling books for the year included stephenie meyer s the twilight saga series  the shack by william p 
young  and the new earth by eckhart tolle 
video game comps increased for the year primarily due to strong sales of new and used video games for the sony playstation  microsoft xbox  and nintendo wii  partially offset by lower sales of older generation video games and lower sales of video game consoles 
movie comps decreased for the year primarily due to lower sales of new dvds  partially offset by strong sales of blu ray format dvds as well as increased sales of used dvds and new and used dvd boxed sets 
new dvd sales were lower primarily due to new releases that did not perform as well as expected  particularly in the third and fourth quarters  which we attribute to the current economic recession 
music comps decreased for the year resulting from continued industry decline  as well as our de emphasis on the category through the reduction of the retail space dedicated to music in thirty stores  which were reformatted during fiscal merchandise comps  excluding the sales of music  increased for the fiscal year ended january  rental comps decreased for the year primarily as a result of fewer rentals of dvds partially offset by strong rentals of video games and blu ray movies 
rental comps were impacted by an unusually limited slate of titles 
table of contents released  primarily during the first nine months of fiscal  as well as a strong following of viewers for the olympics  coverage of the political conventions  and media coverage of the current economic recession in the economy and financial markets 
rental video game comps increased for the year while rental video comps decreased 
fiscal is a leap year which includes an extra day of sales in february 
excluding this extra day of sales  merchandise comps would have decreased for fiscal and rental comps would have decreased for the year 
excluding the extra day of sales  merchandise comps excluding the sales of music would have increased for fiscal  we are projecting a negative total comp in the low single digits for both merchandise and rental sales 
generally  it is difficult for us to project future comp sales 
uncertainty in the direction of the economy makes forecasts of future performance even more difficult 
we are assuming this very challenging environment will continue throughout fiscal as a part of our budget process we have implemented  among other actions  a freeze on raises for our associates  including senior management  and reduced capital expenditures by approximately million 
our comp sales are to a great extent dependent upon the quantity and quality of new releases from the studios  publishers  and hardware manufacturers  as well as general economic conditions and other factors not under our control 
gross profit merchandise 
for fiscal  total merchandise gross profit dollars decreased approximately million  or  to million compared to million for fiscal primarily resulting from lower revenues 
as a percentage of total merchandise revenues  merchandise gross profit increased to for fiscal from for the prior year primarily resulting from improvements in purchasing as well as lower markdown expense  partially offset by increases in shrinkage costs and freight costs for the period 
gross profit rental 
for fiscal  total rental gross profit dollars decreased approximately million  or  to million from million for the prior year 
as a percentage of total rental revenues  rental gross profit decreased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal resulting primarily from lower rental revenues as well as increased purchases of rental assets for the year  which led to increased rental asset depreciation expense as compared to the prior year 
in an effort to drive revenues  we purchased more rental units during the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a increased approximately million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to additional costs associated with the operation of new  expanded  and relocated stores and increased store labor costs associated primarily with increases in the minimum wage and increased advertising expense 
additionally  during the fourth quarter  we recorded approximately million in impairment charges for six underperforming stores  three of which we anticipate closing during fiscal  when each of their respective leases expire 
as a percentage of total revenues  sg a increased to for the twelve months ended january   compared to for the prior year 
interest expense 
for fiscal  interest expense decreased approximately million to million  compared to million during fiscal resulting primarily from lower interest rates 
the average rate of interest charged for the twelve months ended january   decreased to compared to for the prior year 
income tax expense 
during fiscal  the company recorded a charge of approximately million related to an internal revenue service audit of our previously filed federal tax returns 
the irs audit resulted in a change in our tax method used to account for gift cards and the million represents interest due as a result of the audit 
during fiscal  the company recognized a discrete tax benefit in the amount of million related to a favorable settlement of a prior year s state tax liability 
primarily as a result of these items  the effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended january  and were and  respectively fiscal compared to fiscal revenues

some products were reclassified within reporting categories  and new reporting categories were created for electronics  musical instruments  and wireless products

video game comps increased primarily due to strong sales of video game hardware  including xbox  nintendo wii  and playstation consoles  as well as strong sales of new games for these gaming systems 
comps for the trends department rose due to improved plan o gramming throughout the department and an improved assortment of products 
key categories driving trends included strong sales of apparel  such as backpacks  bags and hats  as well as action figures  collectible card games  and seasonal merchandise 
these drivers were partially offset by lower sales of board games and puzzles resulting from reduced levels of inventory carried for these products 
movie comps increased  which was primarily due to strong sales of used dvds along with increased sales of next generation formats  led by blu ray 
book comps increased during fiscal primarily due to the july release of the seventh and final book in the harry potter series as well as strong sales of used books 
music comps fell  directly as a result of continued industry declines as consumers looked to other forms of music alternatives  primarily through digital downloads 
merchandise comps  excluding the sale of music  increased during fiscal rental comps decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a weaker slate of box office releases compared to the prior year along with a shift of consumer preference toward buying dvds and games instead of renting 
we have responded to this shift 
as a result  the combined sales and rental of movies and video games resulted in a comp increase of 
gross profit merchandise 
for fiscal  total merchandise gross profit dollars increased approximately million  or  to million from million for the same period last year 
merchandise gross profit dollars increased primarily due to increased margin rates  which are primarily a result of continued price and margin management

rental gross profit dollars decreased primarily due to lower revenues 
as a percentage of total rental revenues  rental gross profit increased to for fiscal compared to for the same period in the prior year 
rental margin rates are primarily a function of depreciation  which in turn is a function of rental purchases 
due to a weaker slate of box office releases throughout fiscal  overall rental purchases were down versus fiscal traditional rental dvd and game purchases decreased to million for fiscal compared to million during fiscal the decrease in overall rental purchases during fiscal as compared to the same period in the prior year resulted in lower depreciation  which is the primary driver of higher margins for the period 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
as a percentage of total revenues  sg a decreased to for the twelve months ended january  compared to for the same period in the prior year 
sg a decreased approximately million to million for fiscal compared to million for the same period in the prior year

these amounts were partially offset by million of increased store labor costs and million in increased stock compensation expense primarily due to performance based option grants 
income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal during fiscal  the company recognized a tax benefit in the amount of million related to a favorable settlement of a prior year s state tax liability 
excluding this tax benefit  our effective tax rate would have been for fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations from the sale of merchandise and the rental of products  most of which is received in cash and cash equivalents 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operating activities including trade credit from vendors and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  with the most significant source in and being cash flow from operating activities 
other than our principal capital requirements arising from the purchasing  warehousing and merchandising of inventory and rental products  opening new stores and expanding or reformatting existing stores and updating existing and implementing new information systems technology  we have no anticipated material capital commitments  except for the stock buyback programs more fully discussed below 
we believe our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations  new stores  store expansions  and store reformations through fiscal at january   total outstanding debt was million 
we project our outstanding debt level will increase approximately to million during fiscal at january   we had million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve  under the facility as defined below 
consolidated cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal net income for fiscal was approximately million for the year compared to million for fiscal an internal revenue service irs audit of our previously filed income tax returns resulted in a change in our tax method used to account for gift cards 
this change resulted in an increase in deferred tax assets and a related increase in current federal tax liabilities classified within accrued expenses and other liabilities 
deferred income tax expense totaled million for fiscal compared to a deferred income tax expense of million for fiscal  and accrued expenses and other liabilities increased approximately million during fiscal compared to a decrease of million during fiscal  primarily as a result of the irs audit 
merchandise inventories decreased approximately million during fiscal  compared to a decrease of million during fiscal  primarily due to an intense focus on inventory management due to declining sales as a result of the current economic recession 
merchandise inventories  net of trade payables  decreased approximately million for fiscal compared to an increase of million during fiscal during fiscal  we estimate net cash provided by operations of approximately to million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased expenditures related to opening of new stores  relocation of existing stores  and reformatting of thirty stores during the year 
in fiscal  the company projects capital expenditures to be approximately million  a decrease of  from fiscal projected nondiscretionary capital expenditures  which exclude capital expenditures related to new and relocated stores and our updated internet site  are estimated to be approximately to million during fiscal and thereafter 
projected capital expenditures of million include million related to the reformatting of an additional twenty stores  including changes to music  trends  and children s book departments  with remaining planned discretionary capital expenditures related to new stores  relocated stores  and our new internet site 
financing activities 
cash provided by or used in financing activities is primarily associated with borrowings and payments made under our revolving credit facility described below under capital structure 
for fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million compared to cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal  primarily resulting from net borrowings from our revolving credit facility during fiscal of approximately million compared to net repayments for fiscal of approximately million 
we estimate net borrowings from our revolving credit facility will increase approximately to million by january  additionally  the company purchased million of treasury stock in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal we plan to purchase to million of treasury stock during fiscal  which will be dependent upon movement of our stock price and actual fiscal operating results 
changes in our cash overdraft position decreased from a use of million for fiscal to cash provided of million for fiscal  due to timing of payments issued to vendors during the year 
on september   we announced a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock 
prior to fiscal  the board of directors approved increases in the program totaling million  and on december   they approved an additional increase of million 
during fiscal year  we purchased a total of  shares of common stock at a cost of approximately million  or per share 
as of january 
table of contents   a total of  shares had been purchased under the program at a cost of approximately million  for an average cost of approximately per share 
as of january   approximately million remained available for repurchases under the stock repurchase program 
capital structure 
we have a syndicated secured loan and security agreement with bank of america the facility 
the amount outstanding under the facility is limited by a borrowing base predicated on i eligible inventory  as defined in the facility  and ii certain rental assets  net of accumulated depreciation less specifically defined reserves and is limited to a ceiling of million  less a million availability reserve 
we can borrow at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or london interbank offered rate libor  plus applicable margin depending upon the level of our minimum availability 
the borrowing base under the facility is limited to an advance rate of of eligible inventory and certain rental assets  which can be adjusted to reduce availability under the facility 
the lender may increase specifically defined reserves to reduce availability in the event of adverse changes in our industry or our financial condition  that are projected to impact the value of our assets pledged as collateral 
the lender must exercise reasonable judgment and act in good faith with respect to any changes in the specifically defined reserves 
the facility contains no financial covenants  prohibits the payment of dividends and includes certain other debt and acquisition limitations  allows for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock and requires a minimum availability of million at all times 
the facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and our subsidiary and is guaranteed by our subsidiary 
unless the facility is amended and the maturity extended  the facility matures on august  at january   we had million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve  under the facility 
we expect to have to million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve and outstanding letters of credit  at january  however  excess availability may be reduced in the future as changes in the borrowing base occur or the lenders increase availability reserves 
the average rates of interest being charged under the facility for fiscal years ending january  and were and  respectively 
we utilize standby letters of credit to support certain insurance policies 
the aggregate amount of the letters of credit at january  was approximately million  which reduces the excess availability under the facility 
at january   our minimum lease commitments for fiscal were approximately million 
total existing minimum operating lease commitments for fiscal years through was approximately million as of january  
table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
in the ordinary course of business  we routinely enter into purchase commitments for various aspects of our operations  such as warehouse equipment and office equipment 
however  we do not believe that these commitments will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of january   other than operating leases and standby letters of credit  we had not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements or third party guarantees  nor is it our business practice to do so 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than to to more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt principal only operating leases revenue sharing total based on our internal forecasts  we estimate interest payments for fy to be approximately million 
amounts include the direct lease obligations  excluding any taxes  insurance  maintenance and other related expenses 
for the fiscal year ended january   payments for taxes  insurance  maintenance  and other related expenses  which are variable in nature  were approximately million 
amounts exclude future rent reductions  unexecuted as of january   of approximately million  which will be realized over the remaining lives of certain leases 
as of january   we were a party to revenue sharing arrangements with various studios 
these agreements include minimum purchase requirements  based upon the box office results of the title  at a lower initial product cost as compared to non revenue sharing purchases 
in addition  these contracts require net rental revenues to be shared with the studios over an agreed period of time 
we have included amounts owed and an estimate of our contractual obligation under these agreements for performance guarantees and minimum purchase requirements for the period in which they can reasonably be estimated  which is approximately two months in the future 
although these contracts may extend beyond the estimated two month period  we cannot reasonably estimate these amounts due to the uncertainty of purchases that will be made under these agreements 
the amounts presented above do not include revenue sharing accruals for rental revenues recorded during fiscal fin obligations including unrecognized tax benefits of  and accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of  as of january   were not included in this table 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of any future cash outflows related to fin liabilities  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 

table of contents seasonality and inflation our business is highly seasonal  with significantly higher revenues and operating income realized during the fourth quarter  which includes the holiday selling season 
below is a tabular presentation of revenues and operating income by quarter  which illustrates the seasonal effects of our business fiscal year quarter first second third fourth total revenues operating income of full year total revenues operating income fiscal year quarter first second third fourth total revenues operating income of full year total revenues operating income we do not believe that inflation has materially impacted net income during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent such increases are not passed along to customers 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements effective february   we adopted sfas  fair value measurements sfas and its related amendments for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
in february  the fasb issued fasb statement position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed for one year the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non recurring basis 
as a result  we will adopt the provisions of sfas for non financial assets and liabilities as of february  sfas defines fair value  establishes a market based hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value  but does not require any new fair value measurements 
the adoption of fas had no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
the fair value hierarchy established in sfas prioritizes the inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels as follows level observable inputs quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities  level observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities includes quoted prices for similar instruments  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets  and amounts derived from valuation models where all significant inputs are observable in active markets  and level unobservable inputs includes amounts derived from valuation models where one or more significant inputs are unobservable and require us to develop relevant assumptions 
at january  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in assets which are carried at fair value on a recurring basis 
these assets consist of available for sale investments held in a trust related to our non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
the fair value of these investments was determined using level inputs 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas allows companies to elect to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
we elected not to measure any additional assets or liabilities at fair value that are not already measured at fair value under existing standards 
therefore  the adoption of sfas had no impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flow 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which requires  among other things  the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest as of the acquisition date  the immediate expense recognition of transaction costs  and accounting for restructuring plans separately from the business combination 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is not allowed 
this standard will have an impact only if we enter into a business combination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of variable rate debt based on the lenders base rate or libor plus a specified percentage at our option 
the annual impact on our results of operations of a basis point interest rate change on the january   outstanding balance of the variable rate debt would be approximately million 
after an assessment of these risks to our operations  we believe that the primary market risk exposures within the meaning of regulation s k item are not material and are not expected to have any material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the next fiscal year
