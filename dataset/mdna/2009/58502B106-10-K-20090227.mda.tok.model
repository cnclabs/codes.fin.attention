the operating results for the periods presented were not significantly affected by inflation 
overview effective december   mednax  inc and pediatrix completed a holding company formation transaction that established mednax  inc as the parent company of pediatrix 
mednax is a leading provider of physician services including newborn  maternal fetal  pediatric subspecialty  and anesthesia care 
at december   our national network was composed of  affiliated physicians  including physicians who provide neonatal clinical care in states and puerto rico  primarily within hospital based neonatal intensive care units  to babies born prematurely or with medical complications 
we have affiliated physicians who provide maternal fetal and obstetrical medical care to expectant mothers experiencing complicated pregnancies in many areas where our affiliated neonatal physicians practice 
our network includes other pediatric subspecialists  including physicians providing pediatric cardiology care  physicians providing pediatric intensive care and physicians providing hospital based pediatric care 
in addition  we have physicians who provide anesthesia care to patients in connection with surgical and other medical procedures 
the united states is experiencing an economic slowdown 
there have been disruptions in the capital and credit markets  and the number of unemployed workers has increased dramatically 
during  our business was impacted by lower neonatal intensive care unit patient volume and a shift toward government sponsored programs 
the trend in patient volume could continue or accelerate and there could be additional shifts toward government sponsored programs if economic conditions in the united states do not improve 
in addition  federal and state governments continue to focus significant attention on healthcare reform and the possible expansion of government sponsored programs 
see item a  risk factors  in this form k for additional discussion on the decline in the united states economy and recent developments in the healthcare industry that could affect our business 
during  we continued our expansion of services into anesthesia care with the acquisition of two well established anesthesiology physician groups that provide services in raleigh  north carolina and atlanta  georgia 
these two groups joined our fairfax  virginia anesthesiology group practice  which was acquired in september and represented our initial expansion into anesthesiology services 
our national network of physicians and clinical professionals now includes anesthesiologists and advanced practice anesthetists who provide services in three major metropolitan areas 
we continue to believe that there are opportunities to apply our administrative expertise in this practice area and we intend to pursue the acquisition of additional anesthesia practices in in total  we completed the acquisition of physician group practices during the year ended december  these acquisitions consisted of four neonatal practices  four maternal fetal practices  three cardiology practices  and the two anesthesiology practices discussed above 
based on past results  we expect that we can improve the results of these practices through improved managed care contracting  improved collections  identification of growth initiatives  as well as  operating and cost savings based upon the significant infrastructure that we have developed 
in september  we completed a new unsecured million revolving credit facility line of credit and simultaneously terminated our old million line of credit 
the line of credit provides a funding source 
table of contents for future acquisitions  as well as other corporate purposes 
the line of credit is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries and includes a million sub facility for the issuance of letters of credit and a million sub facility for swingline loans 
in addition  the line of credit may be increased to million subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions 
during the year ended december   we completed two separate million share repurchase programs that were authorized by our board of directors in december and may in march  we completed the first share repurchase program buying approximately million shares for approximately million 
in june  we completed the second share repurchase program buying approximately million shares for approximately million 
all repurchases of our common stock were made in the open market subject to price  general economic and market conditions and trading restrictions 
during the year ended december   we also completed the sale of our newborn metabolic screening laboratory business in a cash transaction for approximately million 
the sale of the laboratory has allowed us to focus more resources on the continued expansion of our clinical and administrative competencies within physician services 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for more information regarding the sale of our newborn metabolic screening laboratory business 
in july  the audit committee of our board of directors concluded a comprehensive review of our historical practices related to the granting of stock options 
based on this review  the audit committee and management concluded that incorrect measurement dates were used for certain stock option grants in prior periods 
our results of operations for the years ended december  and include professional fees incurred in connection with the review 
in addition  our results of operations for the year ended december   reflect costs to cover internal revenue code section a a tax obligations on behalf of employees and other payments to employees as a result of stock option measurement date revisions 
geographic coverage during  and  approximately of our net patient service revenue was generated by operations in our five largest states 
during  our five largest states consisted of texas  florida  georgia  virginia and arizona 
during and  our five largest states consisted of texas  florida  arizona  california and washington 
during  our concentration of net patient service revenue increased in georgia and virginia primarily as a result of physician practice acquisitions completed in those states 
during  and  our operations in texas accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our net patient service revenue 
payor mix we bill payors for professional services provided by our affiliated physicians to our patients based upon rates for specific services provided 
our billed charges are substantially the same for all parties in a particular geographic area regardless of the party responsible for paying the bill for our services 
we determine our net patient service revenue based upon the difference between our gross fees for services and our estimated ultimate collections from payors 
net patient service revenue differs from gross fees due to i government sponsored healthcare program reimbursements at government established rates  ii managed care payments at contracted rates  iii various reimbursement plans and negotiated reimbursements from other third parties  and iv discounted and uncollectible accounts of private pay patients 
our payor mix is comprised of government  principally medicaid and medicare  contracted managed care  other third parties and private pay patients 
we benefit from the fact that most of the medical services provided in the nicu are classified as emergency services  a category typically classified as a covered service by managed care payors 

table of contents the following is a summary of our payor mix  expressed as a percentage of net patient service revenue  exclusive of administrative fees  for the periods indicated years ended december  government contracted managed care other third parties private pay patients the payor mix shown in the table above is not necessarily representative of the amount of services provided to patients covered under these plans 
for example  the gross amount billed to patients covered under government programs for the years ended december   and represented  and  respectively  of our total gross patient service revenue 
these percentages of gross revenue and the percentages of net revenue provided in the table above include the payor mix impact of acquisitions completed through december  on a same unit basis  the gross amount billed to patients covered under government programs for the years ended december   and represented  and  respectively  of our total gross patient service revenue 
same units are those units at which we provided services for the entire current period and the entire comparable periods 
the difference between the gross percentage billed to patients covered by government programs for the year ended december  from  on a total company basis  and  on a same unit basis  is due to the payor mix impact of acquisitions completed since december  these most recent acquisitions have a lower government payor mix percentage than the practices  taken as a whole  that comprised our business as of december  payments received from government sponsored programs are substantially less than payments received from managed care and other third party payors 
during the third quarter of  our business was impacted by a shift toward government sponsored healthcare programs 
declining economic conditions could lead to an additional shift toward government sponsored programs as private employers reduce or eliminate healthcare benefits and the general rate of unemployment in the united states rises 
a continued shift to government payors will result in an increase in our estimated provision for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles and a corresponding decrease in our net patient service revenue 
further increases in the government component of our payor mix at the expense of other third party payors could also result in a significant reduction in our average reimbursement rates 
in addition  many states are experiencing lower than anticipated revenues and facing significant budget shortfalls 
these shortfalls could lead to reduced or delayed funding for state medicaid programs and in turn reduced or delayed reimbursement for physician services 
notwithstanding these shortfalls  the american recovery and reinvestment act of the stimulus package  which was enacted in february  contains provisions that will provide states with temporary additional funds to assist them with their medicaid programs 
in addition  the stimulus package contains provisions that will provide subsidies to certain unemployed workers who have elected to extend their employer sponsored health insurance under cobra 
there can be no assurance that the stimulus package will mitigate the impact of the economic decline on our payor mix or our reimbursement from government sponsored programs 
in february  congress reauthorized the state children s health insurance program schip through september and expanded its eligibility coverage 
the expansion of schip eligibility could cause patients who otherwise would have participated in private healthcare insurance programs to participate in government sponsored programs 
additional reform efforts could change the eligibility requirements for other government sponsored programs and could increase the number of patients who participate in such programs or the number of uninsured patients 

table of contents quarterly results we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly fluctuations in net patient service revenue and net income 
these fluctuations are primarily due to the following factors a significant number of our employees and our associated professional contractors  primarily physicians  exceed the level of taxable wages for social security during the first and second quarters of the year 
as a result  we incur a significantly higher payroll tax burden and our net income is lower during those quarters 
there are fewer calendar days in the first and second quarters of the year  as compared to the remainder of the year 
because we provide services in nicus on a hour basis  days a year  any reduction in service days will have a corresponding reduction in net patient service revenue 
the majority of physician services provided by our office based and anesthesia practices consist of office visits and scheduled procedures that occur during business hours 
as a result  volumes at those practices fluctuate based on the number of business days in each calendar quarter 
we have significant fixed operating costs  including physician costs  and  as a result  are highly dependent on patient volume and capacity utilization of our affiliated professional contractors to sustain profitability 
additionally  quarterly results may be affected by the timing of acquisitions and fluctuations in patient volume 
as a result  the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period or for the full year 
our quarterly results are presented in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies  which are all in accordance with generally accepted accounting policies in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements because their application requires management to make assumptions about future results and depends to a large extent on management s judgment  because past results have fluctuated and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
we believe that the application of the accounting policies described in the following paragraphs are highly dependent on critical estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and highly susceptible to change 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize patient service revenue at the time services are provided by our affiliated physicians 
almost all of our patient service revenue is reimbursed by government sponsored healthcare programs principally medicaid and third party insurance payors 
payments for services rendered to our patients are generally less than billed charges 
we monitor our revenue and receivables from these sources and record an estimated contractual allowance to properly account for the anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts 
accordingly  patient service revenue is presented net of an estimated provision for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles 
management estimates allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles on accounts receivable based upon historical experience and other factors  including days sales outstanding dso for accounts receivable  evaluation of expected adjustments and delinquency rates  past adjustments and collection experience in relation to amounts billed  an aging of accounts receivable  current contract and reimbursement 
table of contents terms  changes in payor mix and other relevant information 
contractual adjustments result from the difference between the physician rates for services performed and the reimbursements by government sponsored healthcare programs and insurance companies for such services 
the evaluation of these historical and other factors involves complex  subjective judgments 
on a routine basis  we compare our cash collections to recorded net patient service revenue and evaluate our historical allowance for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles based upon the ultimate resolution of the accounts receivable balance 
these procedures are completed regularly in order to monitor our process of establishing appropriate reserves for contractual adjustments 
dso is one of the key factors that we use to evaluate the condition of our accounts receivable and the related allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles 
dso reflects the timeliness of cash collections on billed revenue and the level of reserves on outstanding accounts receivable 
any significant change in our dso results in additional analyses of outstanding accounts receivable and the associated reserves 
we calculate our dso using a three month rolling average of net patient service revenue 
as of december   our dso was days 
we had approximately million in gross accounts receivable outstanding at december   and considering this outstanding balance  a one percentage point change in our estimated collection rate would result in an impact to net patient service revenue of approximately million 
our net patient service revenue  net income and operating cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if actual adjustments and uncollectibles exceed management s estimated provisions as a result of changes in these factors 
in addition  we are subject to audits of our billing by government sponsored healthcare programs and other third party payors 
see government investigations below and note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k 
stock incentive plans we grant stock based awards consisting of restricted and deferred stock and stock options to key employees under our incentive compensation plan and certain prior incentive compensation plans collectively  stock incentive plans 
as prescribed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
r fas r  share based payment  we recognize the grant date fair value of stock based awards made to employees as compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock option grants using a valuation model known as the black scholes merton formula or the black scholes model and allocate the resulting compensation expense over the corresponding requisite service period associated with each grant 
the black scholes model requires the use of several variables to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options including expected term  expected volatility  expected dividends and risk free interest rate 
we perform significant analyses to calculate and select the appropriate variable assumptions used in the black scholes model 
we also perform significant analyses to estimate forfeitures of stock based awards as required by fas r 
we are required to adjust our forfeiture estimates on at least an annual basis based on the number of share based awards that ultimately vest 
the selection of assumptions and estimated forfeiture rates is subject to significant judgment and future changes to our assumptions and estimates may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
professional liability coverage we maintain professional liability insurance policies with third party insurers on a claims made basis  subject to self insured retention  exclusions and other restrictions 
our self insured retention under our professional liability insurance program is maintained through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary 
we record liabilities for self insured amounts and claims incurred but not reported based on an actuarial valuation using historical loss patterns 
an inherent assumption in such estimates is that historical loss patterns can be used to predict future patterns with reasonable accuracy 
because many factors can affect historical and future loss patterns  the determination of an appropriate reserve involves complex  subjective judgment  and actual results 
table of contents may vary significantly from estimates 
insurance liabilities are necessarily based on estimates  including claim frequency and severity 
liabilities for claims incurred but not reported are not discounted 
goodwill we record acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities at their respective fair values  recording to goodwill the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we test goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis 
we define a reporting unit based upon our management structure for services provided in specific regions of the united states 
the testing for impairment is completed using a two step test 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is performed to determine the amount of any impairment loss 
we use income and market based valuation approaches to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
these approaches focus on discounted cash flows and market multiples based on our market capitalization to derive the fair value of a reporting unit 
we also consider the economic outlook for the healthcare services industry and various other factors during the testing process  including hospital and physician contract changes  local market developments  changes in third party payor payments  and other publicly available information 
accounting for uncertain tax positions effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also requires policy disclosures regarding penalties and interest and extensive disclosures regarding increases and decreases in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken in a current or prior period  settlements with taxing authorities and any lapse of an applicable statute of limitations 
additional qualitative discussion is required for any tax position that may result in a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within a month period from our reporting date 
accounting for uncertain tax positions under fin requires significant judgment and analyses as well as assumptions about future events 
future changes to our analyses and assumptions related to uncertain tax positions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
other matters other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
for example  our consolidated financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis with our affiliated professional contractors because we or one of our subsidiaries have entered into management agreements with our affiliated professional contractors meeting the criteria set forth in the emerging issues task force issue for a controlling financial interest 
our management agreements are further described in note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k 
the policies described in note often require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance and are frequently reexamined by accounting standards setters and regulators 
see new accounting pronouncements for matters that may impact our accounting policies in the future 
government investigations in july  the audit committee of our board of directors concluded a comprehensive review of the company s historical practices related to the granting of stock options with the assistance of independent legal counsel and forensic accounting experts 
at the commencement of the review  we voluntarily contacted the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec regarding the audit committee s review and subsequently the sec commenced a formal investigation into our stock option granting practices 
we also had discussions 
table of contents with the us attorney s office for the southern district of florida regarding the audit committee s review and  in response to a subpoena  provided the office with various documents and information related to our stock option granting practices 
we intend to continue full cooperation with the us attorney s office and the sec 
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters 
in september  we completed a final settlement agreement with the department of justice and a relator who initiated a qui tam complaint against the company relating to our billing practices for services reimbursed by medicaid  the federal employees health benefit program  and the united states department of defense s tricare program for military dependents and retirees federal settlement agreement 
in february  we completed separate state settlement agreements with each state medicaid program involved in the settlement the state settlement agreements 
under the terms of the federal settlement agreement and state settlement agreements  we paid million to the federal government and participating state medicaid programs in connection with our billing for neonatal services provided from january through december as part of the federal settlement agreement  we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement with the oig 
the corporate integrity agreement acknowledges the existence of our comprehensive compliance plan  which provides for policies and procedures aimed at promoting our adherence with fhc program requirements and requires us to maintain the compliance plan in full operation for the term of the corporate integrity agreement 
see government investigations 
failure to comply with our duties under the corporate integrity agreement could result in substantial monetary penalties and in the case of a material breach  could even exclude us from participating in fhc programs 
we believe that we were in compliance with the corporate integrity agreement as of december  we expect that additional audits  inquiries and investigations from government authorities and agencies will continue to occur in the ordinary course of business 
such audits  inquiries and investigations and their ultimate resolutions  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our operations expressed as a percentage of our net patient service revenue patient billings net of contractual adjustments and uncollectibles  and including administrative fees years ended december  net patient service revenue operating expenses practice salaries and benefits practice supplies and other operating expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income year ended december  as compared to year ended december  our net patient service revenue increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   as compared to million for of this million increase  million  or  was attributable to revenue generated from acquisitions completed after december  same unit net patient service revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december  the change in same unit net patient service revenue was the result of increased revenue of approximately million related to pricing and reimbursement factors and approximately million from higher patient service volumes 
the net increase in revenue of million related to pricing and reimbursement factors is primarily due to i improved managed care contracting  ii increased reimbursement for physician services from the texas medicaid program beginning in september  iii increased revenue related to hospital contract administrative fees due to expanded services in existing practices  and iv the flow through of revenue from modest price increases  partially offset by v a decrease in revenue caused by an increase in the percentage of our patients being enrolled in government sponsored programs 
payments received from government sponsored programs are substantially less than payments received from commercial insurance payors for equivalent services 
the net increase in revenue of million from higher patient service volumes includes increased revenue of million from volume growth in maternal fetal  pediatric cardiology and other services  including hearing screens and newborn nursery services  partially offset by decreased revenue of million due to a decline of almost in neonatal intensive care unit patient days 
same units are those units at which we provided services for the entire current period and the entire comparable period 
practice salaries and benefits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to i costs associated with new physicians and other staff of million to support acquisition related growth and volume growth at existing units  and ii an increase in incentive compensation of million as a result of operational improvements at the physician practice level and an increase in the number of practices participating in our incentive compensation program  partially offset by iii a decrease in costs  on a comparative basis  of 
table of contents million related to a tax obligations accrued during the year ended december   and iv a net decrease in professional liability costs of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an adjustment to reduce our liability for accrued professional liability risks by million  net of the related impact on incentive compensation  as a result of better than expected claim experience 
this million adjustment was partially offset by an increase in professional liability costs primarily related to acquisition growth 
practice supplies and other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the increase was attributable to costs of million related to acquisition growth and costs of million for medical supplies  rent and other costs related to growth at our existing units 
the additional costs of million related to acquisition growth are primarily related to office based acquisitions  which require a higher level of practice supplies and other operating expenses due to rent  medical supply and other costs specific to operating office based practices 
general and administrative expenses include all billing and collection functions and all other salaries  benefits  supplies and operating expenses not specifically related to the day to day operations of our physician group practices 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this million net increase was due to i an increase in salaries and benefits and other general and administrative expenses of million related to the continued growth of the company  partially offset by ii a decrease in costs  on a comparative basis  related to stock option review professional fees of million incurred during the year ended december   and iii a decrease in costs  on a comparative basis  related to a tax obligations of million accrued during the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this increase was attributable to the depreciation of fixed asset additions and the amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions 
income from operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for our operating margin decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the net decrease in our operating margin is primarily due to i a decline in operating margin related to lower volume in our neonatal practices  ii the addition of anesthesia and office based services which have a lower operating margin than neonatal services  and iii a decline in operating margin related to a shift in our payor mix from managed care and other third party payors to government sponsored payors  partially offset by iv decreased costs  on a comparative basis  of million related to a tax obligations and stock option review professional fees incurred during the year ended december   and v improved management of general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  we expect incremental improvements in our operating margins related to anesthesia practices over time 
we recorded net interest expense of  for the year ended december   as compared to net investment income of million for the decrease in net investment income is primarily due to borrowings under our line of credit and a decrease in funds available to invest as a result of stock repurchase programs and practice acquisitions completed in late and during  as well as lower returns on our investments 
interest expense for the years ended december  and  consisted of interest charges  commitment fees and amortized debt costs associated with our line of credit 
our effective income tax rate was for the year ended december   as compared to for our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was affected by the recognition of million of tax benefits on uncertain tax positions primarily as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain filed tax returns 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately for all of  excluding any adjustments related to changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions 

table of contents income from continuing operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for income from continuing operations for the year ended december  includes million for the after tax impact of costs to cover a tax obligations and professional fees related to our stock option review  and the recognition of million of tax benefits on uncertain tax positions 
diluted income from continuing operations per common and common equivalent share was on weighted average shares outstanding of million for the year ended december   as compared to on weighted average shares outstanding of million for the net decrease in weighted average shares outstanding was primarily due to the impact of shares repurchased in late and through june under repurchase programs approved by our board of directors in august  december and may  partially offset by an increase in weighted average shares from the exercise of employee stock options  the vesting of restricted stock and the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plans stock purchase plans

cash provided from operating activities during the year ended december  was impacted by our payment of million to settle a previously disclosed medicaid related investigation 
during the year ended december   we had a net use of cash related to accounts receivable of million  compared to a net use of cash of million in the prior year 
the decrease in cash used from operating activities related to accounts receivable during is due to improved cash collections partially offset by same unit net patient service revenue growth and an increase in revenue related to acquisitions completed during we monitor our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable or dso to evaluate the timeliness of cash collections on billed revenue and the condition of our accounts receivable and the related allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles 
during  our dso decreased from days at december  to days at december  see application of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition for more information on our dso 
our accounts receivable are principally due from government payors  managed care payors and other third party insurance payors 
we track our collections from these sources  monitor the age of our accounts receivable  and make all reasonable efforts to collect outstanding accounts receivable through our systems  processes and personnel at our corporate and regional billing and collection offices 
we use customary collection practices  including the use of outside collection agencies for accounts receivable due from private pay patients when appropriate 
almost all of our accounts receivable adjustments consist of contractual adjustments due to the difference between gross amounts billed and the amounts allowed by our payors 
any amounts written off related to private pay patients are based on the specific facts and circumstances related to each individual patient account 
we bill payors for our professional services using billing codes  known as cpt codes  promulgated by the american medical association the ama 
for  the ama has renumbered the cpt codes used to bill for evaluation and management in the nicu 
as a result of these changes  we may experience temporary payment delays from our payors in early as they adjust their reimbursement systems to accommodate the revised codes 
any such delays could temporarily increase our dso 
in addition  many states are experiencing lower than anticipated revenues and facing significant budget shortfalls 
these shortfalls could lead to reduced or delayed funding for state medicaid programs and in turn reduced or delayed reimbursement for physician services

during the year ended december   we had net cash provided from operating activities of million related to accounts payable and accrued expenses  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities related to accounts payable and accrued expenses is principally due to increases in our accruals for uncertain tax positions  professional liability risks and salaries and bonus 
the increase in our accrual for uncertain tax positions of million during is primarily due to the reclassification of certain balances from current taxes payable to our current liability for uncertain tax positions and an increase in our current liability for uncertain tax positions taken on temporary differences associated with acquisitions completed in late the increase in accrued professional liability risks of million during is attributable to the growth in our affiliated physician base due to acquisitions and same unit growth 
the increase in our accrued salaries and bonuses is primarily attributable to the growth in our physician incentive compensation program due to an increase in the number of practices participating in the program and same unit operational improvements at the physician practice level 
a large majority of our affiliated physicians participate in our performance based incentive compensation program and almost all of the payments due under the program are made annually in the first quarter of each year 
as a result  we typically experience negative cash flow from operations in the first quarter of each year and fund our operations during this period with cash on hand or funds borrowed under our line of credit

our capital expenditures were for medical equipment  leasehold improvements  computer and office equipment  and software and furniture at our office based practices and our corporate and regional offices 
during the year ended december   our net cash used in financing activities of million consisted primarily of the repurchase of million of our common stock under share repurchase programs approved by our board of directors in december and may  partially offset by net borrowings under our line of credit of million  proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of common stock under our stock purchase plans of million  and million from the excess tax benefit of stock option exercises and restricted stock vestings 
during the first two quarters of  we completed two separate million share repurchase programs by repurchasing approximately million shares of our common stock for million as authorized by our board of directors in december and may all repurchases were made in open market transactions based upon price  general economic and market conditions and trading restrictions 
in september  we completed a new unsecured million line of credit and simultaneously terminated our old million line of credit 
our line of credit is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries and includes a million sub facility for the issuance of letters of credit and a million sub facility for swingline loans 
in addition  our line of credit may be increased to million subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions 
at our option  our line of credit other than swingline loans bears interest at the alternate base rate  which is defined as the higher of i the federal funds rate plus one half of and ii the wachovia bank  n 
a prime rate or the libor rate  plus  in either case  an applicable margin rate of up to based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
swingline loans bear interest at the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin 
our line of credit matures on september  we are subject to certain covenants and restrictions specified in our line of credit  including covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and to not exceed a specified consolidated leverage ratio  to comply with laws  and restrict us from paying dividends and making certain other distributions  as specified therein 
failure to comply with these covenants would constitute an event of default under our line of credit  notwithstanding our ability to meet our debt service obligations 
our line of credit includes various customary remedies for the lenders following an event of default 
wachovia bank  na  an affiliate of wells fargo company  as administrative agent  bank of america  na  as syndication agent  and na bank  na  as documentation agent  have aggregate commitments of million under our line of credit  and the remaining commitments of million are held by seven other lenders 
our line of credit may be impacted by potential disruptions in the capital and credit markets 
see item a  risk factors  in this form k for more information on the risks associated with our line of credit 
at december   we had an outstanding principal balance of million on our line of credit 
we also had outstanding letters of credit associated with our professional liability insurance program of million which reduced the amount available on our line of credit at december  at december   we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenants and other restrictions applicable to us under our line of credit 
based on our current expectations  we believe we will be in compliance with these covenants during the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock by employees participating in our stock purchase plans generated cash proceeds of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
because stock option exercises and purchases under these plans are dependent on several factors  including the market price of our common stock  we cannot predict the timing and amount of any future proceeds 

table of contents we maintain professional liability insurance policies with third party insurers  subject to self insured retention  exclusions and other restrictions 
we self insure our liabilities to pay self insured retention amounts under our professional liability insurance coverage through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary 
we record liabilities for self insured amounts and claims incurred but not reported based on an actuarial valuation using historical loss patterns 
our total liability related to professional liability risks at december  was million 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with our current cash on hand and funds available under our line of credit  will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements  fund anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures  and meet our contractual obligations as described below for at least the next months 
during  we plan to invest million to million in acquisitions  within our neonatal  maternal fetal and pediatric cardiology specialties 
additionally  we will continue to pursue acquisitions within the anesthesia specialty  although the amount we plan to invest during has not been determined 
contractual obligations at december   we had certain obligations and commitments under capital leases and operating leases totaling approximately million as follows in thousands payments due obligation total and and and later capital leases operating leases certain of our acquisition agreements contain contingent purchase price provisions based on volume and other performance measures 
potential payments under these provisions are not contingent upon the future employment of the sellers 
the amount of the payments due under these provisions cannot be determined until the specific targets or measures are attained 
in some cases  the sellers are eligible for annual payments over a three to five year period based on the growth in profitability of the physician practice with no stated limit on the annual payment amount 
as of december   payments of up to million may be due through under all other contingent purchase price provisions as follows million  million  million  million  and million 
at december   our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million 
the current portion of our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million at december  the timing and amount of payments for each year beyond cannot be reasonably estimated

fas r introduces significant 
table of contents changes in the accounting for and reporting of business acquisitions 
fas r changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
upon adoption  fas r will require us to measure contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date  and will also require us to expense certain acquisition costs as they are incurred 
in addition  fas r will impact the annual goodwill impairment test associated with acquisitions 
fas r must be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we will adopt the provisions of fas r effective january  certain of our acquisitions completed in contained contingent consideration provisions based on volume and other performance measures  and we anticipate that certain acquisitions completed in will contain similar provisions 
amounts to be paid under contingent consideration provisions are typically subject to specified maximums as defined under the respective purchase agreements 
due to the complexities associated with contingent purchase price provisions  we are not able to estimate the impact of applying the new requirements of fas r as they relate to contingent consideration 
in addition  we are not able to estimate the impact of expensing acquisition costs under r due to the varying size and nature of our acquisitions 
acquisition costs related to business combinations completed in were approximately million 
the provisions of fas r related to the impairment of goodwill are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see contractual obligations above and note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for more information on our business acquisitions and the related contingent purchase price provisions 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  fair value measures 
fas creates a common definition of fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
fas also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
fas became effective for fiscal years beginning after november  as permitted by fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 we elected to defer the adoption of fas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the partial adoption of fas on january  had no impact on our consolidated financial statements  and we do not expect the january  adoption of fas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

this fsp is effective for consolidated financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  effective january   we will adopt the provisions of fsp no
