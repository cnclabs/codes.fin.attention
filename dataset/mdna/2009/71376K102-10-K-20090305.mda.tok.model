item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s annual operating performance is subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere herein  as well as the risk factors described in item a of this form k 
the company s future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors  which are beyond the company s control 
these risks and uncertainties include  among other factors  business and economic conditions  rapid technological changes accompanied by frequent new product introductions  competitive pressures  dependence on key customers  inability to gauge order flows from customers  fluctuations in quarterly and annual results  the reliance on a limited number of third party suppliers  limitations of the company s manufacturing capacity and arrangements  the protection of the company s proprietary technology  the dependence on key personnel  changes in critical accounting e stimates  potential impairments related to goodwill and investments  foreign regulations  and potential material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  during weak or uncertain economic periods  customers visibility deteriorates causing delays in the placement of their orders 
these factors often result in a substantial portion of the company s revenue being derived from orders placed within a quarter and shipped in the final month of the same quarter 
matters discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 

table of contents critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  estimates and assumptions are required to be made that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures  including information about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the company believes that given the current facts and circumstances  these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates  and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
management s judgment in making these estimates and relying on these assumptions may materially impact amounts reported for any period 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates that we believe have the most significant effect on our financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition software development costs valuation of inventories income taxes product warranty stock based compensation restructuring costs investments carrying value of goodwill revenue recognition revenue is recognized from product sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
product sales represent the majority of our revenue and include both hardware products and hardware products with embedded software 
revenue is recognized from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
additionally  products are sold on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically the shipping point 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which typically occurs upon shipment 
if these conditions are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as these conditions have been satisfied 
revenue earned from arrangements for software is accounted for under the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition 
for the sale of multiple element arrangements whereby equipment is combined with other elements  such as software and maintenance  the company allocates to  and recognizes revenue from  the various elements based on their fair value 
revenue from software requiring significant production  modification  or customization is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
anticipated losses on contracts  if any  are charged to operations as soon as such losses are determined 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  revenue recognition is deferred and revenue will be recognized when all obligations under the arrangement are fulfilled 
revenue from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered 
certain products are sold through distributors who are granted limited rights of return 
potential returns are accounted for at the time of sale 

table of contents the accounting estimate related to revenue recognition is considered a critical accounting estimate because terms of sale can vary  and judgment is exercised in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
software development costs all software development costs incurred in establishing the technological feasibility of computer software products to be sold are charged to expense as research and development costs 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold and prior to general release of that product are capitalized 
amounts capitalized are amortized commencing after general release of that product over the estimated remaining economic life of that product  generally three years  using the straight line method or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such product  whichever provides greater amortization 
if the technological feasibility for a particular project is judged not to have been met or recoverability of amounts capitalized is in doubt  project costs are expensed as research and development or charged to cost of goods sold  as applicable 
the ac counting estimate related to software development costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining whether project costs are expensed as research and development or capitalized as an asset 
such judgments may materially affect expense amounts for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when technological feasibility has been met and recoverability of software development costs is reasonably assured 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
inventory includes purchased parts and components  work in process and finished goods 
provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory are recorded after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials are the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks 
exposure to inventory valuation risks is managed by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventor ies 
the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is considered a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors  ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles differ from estimates  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets in amounts for which realization is not considered more likely than not to occur 
the accounting estimate related to income taxes is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in estimating future taxable income  including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and in assessing the need for any valuation allowance 
if it should be determined that all or part of a net deferred tax asset is not able to be realized in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  in the event that it should be determined that all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future is in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income to be recognized in the period such determination was made 

table of contents the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the company 
conversely  if these issues are resolved favorably in the future  the related provisions would be reduced  thus having a positive impact on earnings 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
as a result of the implementation of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  the company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires the company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires the company to determine the probability of various possible ou tcomes 
the company re evaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
finally  the recorded value of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
these assets consist of research credit carry forwards  capital and net operating loss carry forwards  and the future tax effect of temporary differences between balances recorded for financial statement purposes and for tax return purposes 
it will require future pre tax earnings of in excess of million in order to fully realize the value of the company s deferred tax assets 
of this amount  approximately  of capital gains must be realized in or in order to fully realize the recorded balance of deferred tax assets relating to capital loss carryforwards 
if the company were to sustain future net losses  it may be necessary to record valuation allowances against such deferred tax assets in order to recognize impairments in their estimated future economic value 
product warranty warranty obligations are generally incurred in connection with the sale of the company s products 
the warranty period for these products is generally one year 
the costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale 
future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products 
the accounting estimate related to product warranty is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining future estimated warranty costs 
should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
stock based compensation the company s board of directors approves grants of stock options to employees to purchase our common stock 
under the provisions of sfas no 
revised share based payment  stock compensation expense is recorded based upon the estimated fair value of the stock option at the date of grant 
the accounting estimate related to stock based compensation is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating compensation expense including expected option lives  forfeiture rates and expected volatility 
expected option lives are estimated using vesting terms and contractual lives 
expected forfeiture rates and volatility are calculated using historical information 
actual option lives and forfeiture rates may be different from estimates and may result in potential future adjustments which would impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in a particular period 

table of contents restructuring costs restructuring costs consist of employee related severance costs  lease termination costs and other facility related closing expenses 
employee related severance benefits are recorded either at the time an employee is notified or  if there are extended service periods  is estimated and recorded pro rata over the period of each planned restructuring activity 
lease termination costs are calculated based upon fair value considering the remaining lease obligation amounts and estimates for sublease receipts 
the accounting estimate related to restructuring costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating the amount of employee related severance benefits that will ultimately be paid and the amount of sublease receipts that will ultimately be received in future periods 
actual amounts paid for employee related severance benefits can vary from these estimates depending upon the number of employees actually receiving severance payments 
actual sublease receipts received may also vary from estimates 
investments we recognize realized losses when declines in the fair value of our investments  below their cost basis  are judged to be other than temporary 
in determining when a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including market price if available  investment ratings  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee and the underlying collateral  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the extent to which the investment is guaranteed  the financial health of the guarantor if any  and our ability and intent to hold the investment until maturity or for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we make significant judgments in considering these factors 
if it were judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the investment is valued as the current fair value and a realized loss equal to the decline is reflected as an ad justment to net income 
such adjustments could materially adversely affect our operating results 
carrying value of goodwill tests for impairments of goodwill are conducted annually  at year end  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
sfas no 
requires a two step method for determining goodwill impairment where step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
an impairment loss is then recognized to the extent that the goodwill s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the company is considered to consist of being only one reporting unit 
the quoted market capitalization of the company was less than the company s book value at december  the company used a discounted cash flow valuation model applied to a five year projection of future cash flows in its evaluation of goodwill 
this cash flow valuation model necessarily involves considerable judgment in the estimation of inputs and assumptions used in this cash flow valuation model 
the accounting estimate related to impairment of goodwill is considered a critical accounting estimate because these impairment tests include estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including revenue growth rates  expense levels  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact estimated future cash flows and the estimated implied fair value of the company 
should actual results differ materially from those projected  it may become necessary to record an impairment against some or all of the carrying value of goodwill 
the current economic downturn has negatively impacted many of these inputs and assumptions 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate further  this would increase the likelihood of future non cash impairment charges related to the carrying value of goodwill 

table of contents key performance indicators the company believes that a key indicator for its business is the trend for the volume of orders received from customers 
during weak economic periods  customers ability to forecast their requirements deteriorates causing delays in the placement of orders 
forward looking visibility on customer orders is at an all time low 
most of our embedded systems customers are placing orders for product only when they have orders in hand from their customers 
total shipments to customers in amounted to million  compared to million in this slight increase in revenue was attributable to higher shipments of products to the company s two largest customers  data connection limited and alcatel lucent  and higher signaling shipments  offset primarily by lower shipments to our traditional oem telecommunications customers 
as a result of increased product demand from their customers in  our shipments to data connection limited increased by million and our shipments to alcatel lucent increased by 
million 
overview the company is a global supplier of advanced network communications and control solutions to end users  application developers and original equipment manufacturers that serve mission critical telecommunications  aerospace and defense markets 
performance technologies is a delaware corporation and since its founding in it has supplied standards based products and solutions to its customers

management believes the tight integrated combination of these technologies results in measurable benefits to its customers 
the company s business addresses one industry segment communications and globally targets two primary vertical markets for its communications products  namely telecommunications and aerospace and defense 
the telecommunications market  historically our largest vertical market  is fundamentally driven by investments in network infrastructure by carriers and service providers 
telecommunications market revenues derived from our oem and application ready systems products are primarily dependent on broad  multi year deployments of next generation telecommunications infrastructure 
telecommunications market revenues generated from end solutions  such as our signaling products  are governed by investments necessary to support existing and evolving service demands such as the ongoing worldwide explosive growth in text messaging 
sales into the aerospace and defense market are typically to prime contractors and system integrators that reflect investment levels by various government agencies and military branches in specific programs and projects requiring enhanced communications capabilities 
compared to the traditional oem telecommunications equipment market we serve  gross margins are higher and the sales cycles are shorter for both the aerospace and defense and signaling product markets 
industry overview the telecommunications market is fundamentally driven by investments in network infrastructure by carriers and service providers 
telecommunications market revenues derived from our oem and application ready systems products are primarily dependent on broad  multi year deployments of next generation telecommunications infrastructure 
while this market was very challenging throughout  it began deteriorating rapidly during the third quarter as customers made decisions to preserve cash  rather than to invest in their network infrastructure 
telecommunications market revenues generated from end solutions are governed by investments necessary to support existing and evolving service demands 
segway signaling product revenues grew in as the ongoing worldwide explosive growth in text messaging put pressure on carriers and service providers to build infrastructure to support the higher volumes and the cost attributes of ip networks became more enticing 
sales into the aerospace and defense market are typically to prime contractors and system integrators that reflect investment levels by various government agencies and military branches in specific programs and projects requiring enhanced communications capabilities 
aerospace and defense shipments are subject to project deployment schedules and are not often consistent from quarter to quarter 
while our aerospace and defense shipments declined somewhat in  compared to  we believe there are an increasing number of project opportunities for our products and management expects to add additional sales and marketing focus to this area in there is little doubt that the economic climate in will be very challenging for the company 
although market interest and activity related to our product portfolio remains strong  actual sales visibility is at an all time low 
in light of these conditions  staffing reductions were initiated in january to further reduce our expense levels 
this measure  which is expected to result in a 
million restructuring charge in the first quarter  reduces the company s annual expense level by approximately million 
despite the necessity for these expense control measures  we remain dedicated to continuing our strategic programs  which are expected to generate long term growth 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further discussion of the industry  markets and economic environment 
strategy the company s strategy is to maximize the value proposition of its products by leveraging its field proven systems  software and hardware technologies 
management believes the tight integrated combination of these technologies results in measurable benefits to its customers through compelling development risk mitigation and substantially accelerated time to market metrics 
management is proceeding with multi faceted initiatives to construct a solid foundation for long term profitable growth 
these efforts are directed at niches within the communications market including signaling  aerospace and defense 
there are identifiable risks associated with the company s strategy in the current economic climate 
while management believes that the signaling  aerospace and defense are growing markets  the application developers and original equipment manufacturers markets for communications products are experiencing challenging economic conditions which are impacting business prospects 
management expects to realize measurable progress on its strategic initiatives for however  based on the current economic environment  management believes that realizing meaningful financial performance will be very difficult

million  which was paid in january in january   the company implemented a strategic reduction of its existing workforce in response to the challenging global economic environment 
as a result of this action  the company eliminated twenty positions  or approximately of its global workforce 
this action is expected to yield annual operating expense savings in excess of million 
in connection with this reduction  the company expects to incur first quarter pre tax restructuring charges of approximately 
million  primarily for employee related costs 
substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures

assessment of carrying value of goodwill 
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is separately disclosed in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of both december  and  goodwill totaled million  representing of total assets at both dates 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or as impairment indicators arise 

table of contents the impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of business reporting units to their carrying value  including assigned goodwill 
in assessing potential impairment of goodwill  we have determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of applying sfas no 
based on our reporting structure 
the fair value of our single reporting unit is determined using many factors  including the company s stock price and market capitalization  future business plans and projected earnings and cash flows 
the company s determination is made using a discounted cash flow analysis and management s projections of future cash flows  as well as using an analysis of control and liquidity premiums applied to the company s stock price 
the results of the annual impairment tests performed as of december   and indicated the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
if the per share fair value of our single reporting unit  as determined by our a nnual impairment test  was less than the book value per share on december   our goodwill would have been impaired 
our goodwill may also need to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value 
should actual results differ materially from those projected  it may become necessary to record an impairment charge against some or all of the carrying value of goodwill 
the current economic downturn has negatively impacted many of these inputs and assumptions 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate further  this would increase the likelihood of future non cash impairment charges related to the carrying value of goodwill 
other income  net 
other income consists primarily of interest income and totaled million in  compared to million in this decrease was due to a sharp decline in the yields the company earned on its investments  resulting from lower interest rates in general and the company s decision to invest in lower risk investment securities
