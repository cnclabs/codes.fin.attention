item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contractual obligations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate expenditures for our plant development and other activities  or seek to enter into a business combination transaction with or sell assets to another company 
we could also be forced to license to third parties the rights to commercialize additional products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves 
the transactions outlined above may not be available to us when needed or on terms acceptable or favorable to us 
we need to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market to be able to access adequate funding from time to time 
we face de listing issues that would impair the liquidity of our stock and our availability to access the capital markets 
our stock price is currently below and has remained so since november  nasdaq rules call for the potential de listing of a company if its stock trades under per share for consecutive days 
in light of the current economic downturn  the nasdaq has extended the time for companies to come into compliance with the requirement until april  we can make no assurance that we will be able to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market 
we are the subject of litigation which if adversely determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our lawsuit with fletcher international lta is described in detail at item legal proceedings 
construction and operations of plants based on the syntroleum and synfining processes or bio synfining technology will be subject to risks of delay and cost overruns 
the construction and operation of plants based on the syntroleum and synfining processes or bio synfining technology will be subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns resulting from numerous factors  including the following shortages of equipment  materials or skilled labor  unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment  engineering problems  including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment  work stoppages  weather interference  unanticipated cost increases  and difficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals 

table of contents we have incurred losses and anticipate continued losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not yet achieved profitability from continuing operations and we expect to continue incurring net losses until we recognize sufficient revenues from licensing activities  plants utilizing the syntroleum and synfining processes or bio synfining technology or other sources 
because we do not have an operating history upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be based  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by small companies seeking to develop new and rapidly evolving technologies 
to address these risks we must  among other things  continue to attract investment capital  respond to competitive factors  continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel and commercialize and continue to upgrade the syntroleum and synfining processes and bio synfining technologies 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks  and we may not achieve or sustain profitability 
our anticipated expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future operating activities and not on historical financial data 
we plan to continue funding project development activities 
capital expenditures will depend on progress we make in developing various projects on which we are currently working 
increased revenues or cash flows may not result from these expenses 
if prices or margins for crude oil  natural gas  coal  vegetable oils and fats and other commodities are unfavorable  plants based on the syntroleum and synfining processes or bio synfining technology may not be economical 
because the synthetic crude oil  liquid fuels and specialty products that plants utilizing the syntroleum and synfining processes or bio synfining technology are expected to produce will compete in markets with oil and refined petroleum products  and because natural gas  coal  biomass  fats or vegetable oils will be used as the feedstock for these plants  an increase in feedstock prices relative to prices for oil or refined products  or a decrease in prices for oil or refined products relative to feedstock prices  could adversely affect the operating results of these plants 
higher than anticipated costs for the catalysts and other materials used in these plants could also adversely affect operating results 
prices for oil  natural gas  coal  biomass  fats  greases  vegetable oils and refined products are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
factors that could cause changes in the prices and availability of oil  natural gas  coal  biomass  fats  vegetable oils and refined products include level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign government regulation  actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  political conditions in countries producing feedstocks for fuels plants  supply of crude oil  natural gas  coal  biomass fats  greases and vegetable oils  location of gtl plants relative to natural gas reserves and pipelines  location of ctl plants relative to coal reserves and transportation systems  location of btl plants relative to biomass reserves and transportation systems  capacities of pipelines  fluctuations in seasonal demand  crop yields  seasonality of prices for feedstocks and refined products  farmer planting decisions  output and proximity of crush facilities that convert the crops to oils  alternative uses for fats  number of animals slaughtered and rendered  price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions 

table of contents we cannot predict the future markets and prices for oil  natural gas  coal or other materials used in the syntroleum and synfining processes and bio synfining technology or refined products 
we believe that the syntroleum and synfining processes can be economic for gtl  btl and ctl plants given the current world crude oil prices 
however  the markets for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
crude oil prices could return to such low levels in the future 
our success depends on the performance of our executive officers and key personnel  the loss of who would disrupt our business operations 
we depend to a large extent on the performance of our executive officers  including edward g 
roth  our chief executive officer  karen l 
gallagher  our senior vice president of finance and principal financial officer 
our ability to implement our business strategy may be constrained and the timing of implementation may be impacted if we are unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel 
at december   we had full time employees 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
we have entered into employment agreements with several key employees 
we depend on strategic relationships with feedstock suppliers  construction contractors  site owners  manufacturing and engineering companies  and customers 
if we are not successful in entering into and achieving the benefits of these relationships  this could negatively impact our business 
our or our licensee s ability to identify and enter into commercial arrangements with feedstock suppliers  construction contractors  engineering service companies  site owners  manufacturing and engineering companies  and customers will depend on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants 
our success in this area will also depend on our ability to select and evaluate suitable projects  as well as to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
these relationships may take the form of joint ventures with other private parties or local government bodies  contractual arrangements with other companies  including those that supply feedstock that we will use in our business  or minority investments from third parties 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to establish these strategic relationships  or  if established  that the relationships will be maintained 
in addition  the dynamics of our relationships with strategic participants may require us to incur expenses or undertake activities we would not otherwise be inclined to incur or undertake in order to fulfill our obligations to these partners or maintain these relationships 
if we do not successfully establish or maintain strategic relationships  our business may be negatively affected 
our operating results may be volatile due to a variety of factors and are not a meaningful indicator of future performance 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in future annual and quarterly operating results because of the unpredictability of many factors that impact our business 
these factors include timing of any construction by us or our licensees of plants  demand for licenses or other technology transfer agreements of the syntroleum and synfining processes or bio synfining technology and receipt and revenue recognition of license fees  feedstock prices  prices for refined products timing and amount of research and development expenditures  demand for synthetic fuels and specialty products  introduction or enhancement of ft and renewable fuels technologies by us and our competitors  market acceptance of new technologies  and general economic conditions 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it may be that in some future year or quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we are subject to extensive laws relating to the protection of the environment  and these laws may increase the cost of designing  constructing and operating our plants based on the syntroleum processes or our bio synfining technology or affect demand for the products of these plants 
if we violate any of the laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  we may be subject to substantial fines  criminal sanctions or third party lawsuits and may be required to install costly pollution control equipment or  in some extreme cases  curtail operations 
our ft and renewable fuels plants will generally be required to obtain permits under applicable environmental laws and various permits for industrial siting and construction 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations  as well as with any requisite environmental or construction permits  may increase the costs of designing  constructing and operating our plants 
we may also face exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters with respect to our previously owned real estate 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  competitive position  or financial condition 
for instance  in response to studies suggesting that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere  the us congress is actively considering legislation  and more than a dozen states have already taken legal measures to reduce emission of these gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
new legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse affect on our operations 
terrorist threats and us military actions could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere could occur 
these developments and similar future events may cause instability in the world s financial and insurance markets and could significantly increase political and economic instability in the geographic areas in which we may wish to operate 
these developments could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil  natural gas and the feedstocks for our plants and the cost and availability of insurance 
in addition  these developments could adversely affect our ability to access capital and to successfully implement projects currently under development 
united states government regulations effectively preclude us from actively engaging in business activities in certain countries 
these regulations could be amended to cover countries where we may wish to operate in the future 
these developments could subject the operations of our company to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face 
we do not carry a significant amount of business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance  such as a leak  fire or explosion could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item legal proceedings we entered into an agreement the agreement with fletcher international  ltd 
fletcher on november  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  fletcher agreed to purchase million dollars worth of syntroleum stock over a twenty four month period 
the purchase was divided into an initial investment of million at a premium to the trading price of syntroleum stock and a later investment at a discount to the trading price of syntroleum stock 
fletcher refused to close on the initial investment at a premium  asserting that all of the conditions precedent had not been satisfied  and subsequently attempted to make a later investment at a discount 
we refused to close on the grounds that  because fletcher failed to make the initial investment  fletcher was not entitled to go forward with the later investments 
we filed a petition on may  in the district court of tulsa county  state of oklahoma for breach of contract  rescission and declaratory judgment  seeking a determination of the company s rights and obligations under the agreement 
on june   fletcher removed that lawsuit to the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma  and subsequently filed a motion to dismiss or  in the alternative  motion to transfer venue to new york 
fletcher also filed a competing lawsuit arising out of the same dispute in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on june   alleging breach of contract based on the company s refusal to go forward with the later investment 
on august   the new york action was stayed pending the outcome of fletcher s motions in the oklahoma federal court 
after considering the jurisdictional motions  the oklahoma court dismissed that case on november  syntroleum filed a motion to reconsider on december   which is currently pending 
in the meantime  the new york court has lifted the stay and discovery is currently proceeding in that court 
although discovery is in the early stages  the parties have exchanged information regarding their respective claims for damages 
fletcher claims that it has suffered approximately million in damages as a result of syntroleum s alleged breach of contract 
syntroleum also claims to have suffered damages as a result of fletcher s breach of contract  but has not claimed a specific amount 
both parties seek to recover their respective attorneys fees if they prevail 
at this time  we cannot determine the likely outcome of this litigation and have therefore not recorded a liability in our consolidated balance sheet at december  however  if fetcher s allegations are sustained  we could be forced to issue up to  shares of its common stock and respond to any damages fletcher incurs  including legal expenses 
we intend to vigorously defend this matter 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of the litigation matter specifically described above or of any such other pending litigation 
there can be no assurance that our belief or expectations as to the outcome or effect of any lawsuit or other litigation matter will prove correct and the eventual outcome of these matters could materially differ from management s current estimates

our stock price may continue to be volatile and could decline in the future 
historically  the market price of our common stock has been very volatile 
the trading price of our common stock is expected to continue to be subject to substantial volatility in response to numerous factors  including publicity regarding actual or potential results with respect to development of the syntroleum technologies and the design  construction and commercial operation of plants using our process  announcements of technological innovations by others with competing processes  developments concerning intellectual property rights  including claims of infringement  annual and quarterly variances in operating results  changes in energy prices  competition  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  any differences in actual results and results expected by investors and analysts  investor perception of our favorable or unfavorable prospects and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced and continues to experience significant price and volume volatility that has affected the market price of equity securities of many companies 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we are required to maintain standards for listing of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
we can make no assurance that we will be able to remain listed on the nasdaq capital market 
future sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
substantial sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception by the market that those sales could occur  could lower our stock price or make it difficult for us to raise additional equity capital in the future 
these sales could include sales of shares of our common stock by our directors and officers  who beneficially owned approximately percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of march  we cannot predict if future sales of our common stock  or the availability of our common stock for sale  will harm the market price for our common stock or our ability to raise capital by offering equity securities

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview our focus is the commercialization of innovative technology to produce synthetic liquid hydrocarbons that are substantially free of contaminants normally found in conventional hydrocarbon products 
our bio synfining technology processes triglycerides and or fatty acids from fats and vegetable oils with heat  hydrogen and proprietary catalysts to make renewable synthetic fuels  such as diesel  heating oil  jet fuel subject to certification  kerosene  naphtha and propane 
syntroleum has quantified in excess of different fats and oils  which cover the spectrum of both cost and quality  for conversion to synthetic fuels via the bio synfining technology 
operations to date have consisted of activities related to the commercialization of a proprietary process the syntroleum process and previously consisted of research and development of the syntroleum process designed to convert natural gas into synthetic liquid hydrocarbons gas to liquids or gtl 
synthetic liquid hydrocarbons produced by the syntroleum process can be further processed using the syntroleum synfining process into high quality liquid fuels 
our bio synfining technology is a renewable fuels application of our synfining product upgrading technology 
we are also applying our technology to convert synthesis gas derived from coal coal to liquids or ctl or bio feedstocks biomass to liquids or btl into these same high quality products 
we are centered on being a recognized provider of the bio synfining technology  syntroleum process and synfining product upgrading technology to the energy industry through strategic relationships and licensing of our technology 
operating revenues during the periods discussed below  our revenues were primarily generated from technical services revenue from engineering service rendered to dynamic fuels for the process design package as well as other engineering services  licensing revenue from marathon  reimbursement for research and development activities associated with the syntroleum process and sales of products for testing purposes 
in the future  we expect to receive revenue from sales of engineering technical services  royalties from the dynamic fuels plant and other income from our joint owned subsidiary dynamic fuels  sales and licensing of our technology and product sales or royalties for the use of gtl  btl and ctl plants in which we will own an equity interest 
until the commencement of commercial operation of our dynamic fuels facility located in geismar  louisiana  we expect that cash flow relating to the synfining process or syntroleum process will consist primarily of revenues associated with technical services provided by our engineers and sales and licensing of our technology 
upon commercial operations of our dynamic fuels facility we will receive royalty fees based on the production of the facility 
commercial operations are expected to begin in the second half of we expect to receive additional profits from the operations of the facility based on our proportionate equity ownership of the plant 
we may receive revenues associated with the sale of the use of our technology to certain customers with limited rights in certain geographic areas 
our future operating revenues and investments in projects will depend on the successful commercial construction and operation of the dynamic fuels facility or other gtl  btl or ctl plants based on the syntroleum process  the success of competing gtl technologies  and other competing uses for natural gas  biomass or coal 
we expect our results of operations and cash flows to be affected by changing crude oil  natural gas  oils  animal fats  fuel and specialty product prices and trends in environmental regulations 
if the price of these products increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in operating revenues 
we continue to incur operating expenses with respect to commercializing the syntroleum process and the bio synfining and synfining process and do not anticipate recognizing any significant revenues or investments in projects from production from our bio synfining facility until the second half of we expect to obtain revenues from the transfer of technology documentation to customers or through licensing structures in any deposits or advance payments for the technology documentation is recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until recognized as revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
operating expenses our operating expenses historically have consisted primarily of the construction and operation of the catoosa demonstration facility  pilot plant  engineering  including third party engineering  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses  which include costs associated with general corporate overhead  compensation expense  legal and accounting expenses and expenses associated with other related administrative functions 

table of contents we have also recognized depreciation  depletion and amortization expense related to office and computer equipment  buildings and leasehold improvements and patents 
we have reduced our costs and expenses over the past two years with the completion of our research and development efforts related to running the cdf and pilot plant  operating costs declined as a result of suspending operations at both plants  reducing our workforce and focusing on cost minimization 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed all other research and development activities  including all laboratory work and reduced our work force and focused on cost minimization 
our workforce decreased by employees during to a current headcount of employees as of december  our reduction in workforce included research and development employees and general and administrative employees 
our current workforce consists of engineers and general and administrative employees 
these cost saving measures implemented in the fourth quarter of and in had a significant favorable impact on our operating expenses and we expect to continue to focus on these cost saving measures on a go forward basis 
we do not expect to rehire any of the employees included in the reductions if we accelerate the development of a commercial project 
our operating expenses are not expected to increase further within the near future 
we have incurred costs related specifically to the development and design of the bio synfining and syntroleum process 
these costs  which relate primarily to engineers  outside contract services for initial engineering  design  and development are included in engineering costs in our consolidated statements of operations 
if we are successful in developing a bio synfining plant in which we own an interest  we expect to invest our portion of start up and capital expenditures  including working capital of million for our shares of the engineering design  construction and start up of the plant  of which million has already been contributed 
upon the commencement of commercial operations of a plant  we will incur our share of initial working capital which includes expenses relating primarily to the cost of feedstocks for the plant and operating expenses relating to the plant  including labor  consumables and product marketing costs 
due to the substantial capital expenditures associated with the construction of a bio synfining plant  we expect the plant will incur significant depreciation and amortization expense in the future 
discontinued operations research and development our policy is to expense costs associated with the catoosa demonstration facility and pilot plant  and research and development costs as incurred in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
all of these research and development expenses were associated with the development of our syntroleum process 
the catoosa demonstration facility expenses previously included costs to maintain and operate the facility for further research and development as well as for demonstrations for licensees and other customers 
the expenses associated with the facility in include certain expenses associated with the mothball state of the facility  primarily rent and utilities associated with the office space 
research and development expenses previously included costs to operate our laboratory and technology center  salaries and wages associated with these operations  research and development services performed by universities  consultants and third parties and additional supplies and equipment for these facilities 
our policy is to expense costs associated with the development of gtl plants or other projects until we begin our process design package and front end engineering and design program on the respective projects 
we have incurred costs related specifically to the development of the syntroleum process 
international oil and gas we previously pursued international oil and gas activities  which primarily included the leasehold acquisition  geological and geophysical work covering various areas in nigeria  and drilling costs for the aje discovery well aje in oil mining lease oml offshore nigeria 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit our international oil and gas activities due to limited access to capital requirements 
we sold all the stock of various subsidiaries  including syntroleum nigeria limited which held our interests in the ajapa and aje fields offshore nigeria to african energy equity resources limited aeerl  a direct wholly owned subsidiary of energy equity resources norway limited eernl for a total of  significant developments during commercial and licensee projects on june   we entered into definitive agreements with tyson to form a joint venture limited liability company  dynamic fuels  llc  a delaware limited liability company dynamic fuels  to construct facilities in the united states using our bio synfining technology 
the purpose of dynamic fuels is to construct multiple stand alone commercial plants in the united states 
the first facility is being constructed in geismar  louisiana and  based on current estimates  will produce approximately million gallons per year of renewable synthetic fuels beginning in the llc agreement provides for management and control of dynamic fuels to be exercised jointly by representatives of the company and tyson equally with no llc member exercising control 
it was initially capitalized on july  with million in capital contributed from tyson and million in capital contributions from syntroleum 

table of contents this project continues to progress forward 
all previous milestones have been met on time and on budget 
in accordance with the agreement  the site selection has been finalized and the process design package has been delivered to dynamic fuels by our engineers 
the front end engineering and design feed package outlining the estimated capital budget was delivered to each party in may of upon completion of this final activity  the parties met to approve plant sanction based upon the capital budget for plant design and construction 
both parties approved plant sanction in july of the official groundbreaking occurred on october  the capital and working capital budget for dynamic fuels financing  construction and initial operations of the first plant to use our bio synfining technology is estimated to equal million in total 
dynamic fuels received approval from the louisiana state bond commission to sell million in gulf opportunity tax exempt bonds to partially finance the plant 
these bonds were sold on october   in the amount of million 
syntroleum and tyson made capital contributions in the amount of million each to satisfy current funding requirements for capital expenditures relating to procurement of long lead equipment and construction of the plant in july on july   both members approved plant sanction and committed collectively an additional million in in capital contributions for funding of the construction of the plant 
the remaining estimated million will be required to be funded proportionately in the second half of timing of funding is contingent based on cash needs during construction 
the funding in from syntroleum was paid out of available cash 
proceeds debt and equity contributions dynamic synm in millions fuels portion funded proceeds from debt issuance funded equity contributions from members july committed equity contributions from members total proceeds debt and equity contributions interest during construction is calculated based on the daily interest rate stated at closing of percent for months 
the interest rate for the bonds is a daily floating interest rate and may change significantly from this amount 
dynamic fuels entered into an interest rate swap of for a period of years with declining swap coverage in the fourth quarter of tyson is responsible for supplying feedstock to the plant  which can range from high quality canola or soy vegetable oils to fats and greases  either from its own internal sources or from supplies it procures in the open market 
the feedstock supply agreement provides a pricing formula for the feedstock  which is generally equivalent to the market price 
the tyson fat blend feedstock is expected to provide us with a notable cost advantage compared to users of soybean oil feedstock 
the feedstock slate will be subject to change based upon market availability and other factors 
we currently expect that the first facility will produce approximately diesel  naphtha and liquefied petroleum gases based on annual gallons of feedstock  although actual production will depend upon market conditions and other factors 
we expect that dynamic fuels will be eligible for a federal excise tax credit of per gallon for diesel produced and per gallon for naphtha and liquefied petroleum gases produced 
dod projects 
in june we signed a contract to produce an initial gallons of aviation grade renewable research fluid syntroleum r  a product of bio synfining for analysis by the same group in the department of defense that previously tested syntroleum s this contract was later expanded to include production of an additional gallons of r and test quantities of same fuel derived from other renewable sources 
the syntroleum r produced by our bio synfining technology from waste fats and greases was found to exhibit substantially similar properties to our syntroleum s produced by our synfining process under comparative analysis of the two products 
this successful testing of this product was completed in results of operations consolidated results for the years ended december  revenues in thousands licensing revenue from marathon technical services revenue other revenue total revenues 
table of contents licensing revenue from marathon 
licensing revenue was  for the year ended december  related to the new consolidation and license agreement granted to marathon in january of  and the recognition of previously deferred license fee credits of  the new licensing agreement was entered into to settle a convertible debt obligation to marathon for funding a portion of our catoosa demonstration facility 
there was no licensing revenue for the years ended december  and we do not anticipate receiving additional licensing revenue from marathon in the near term 
technical services revenue 
revenues from contracted engineering services for a process design package and other engineering services for dynamic fuels and other separately contracted engineering services for technical work were recognized in and services provided to dynamic fuels were for twelve months compared to months in there was no revenue received from technical services for the years ended december  we expect to continue to earn revenues for engineering services provided for dynamic fuels in as well as we will provide additional engineering services to other customers on an individual contract basis 
other revenue 
the revenues recognized in consisted primarily of initial testing of gallons of renewable jet fuel by the dod in the amount of  in and  in revenue in also consisted of fuel sales to the department of transportation of approximately  in we completed the delivery of  gallons of s synthetic diesel to the dod for testing in aircraft and vehicle engines related to a dod fuel delivery contract in the amount of approximately  we have nearly sold all of our fischer tropsch fuel from our demonstration facility and do not expect significant revenues to be recognized for the sale of the remaining fuel 
operating costs and expenses in thousands engineering depreciation  depletion  amortization non cash equity compensation general and administrative and other total operating costs and expenses engineering expense 
the change in expenditures in from resulted primarily from decreased expenditures associated with outside engineering firms for work on mechanical reactor designs and retention bonuses were paid and accrued for in as an incentive to retain key engineers 
non cash equity compensation 
equity compensation expense for the vesting of stock compensation awards to employees decreased in the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in work force resulting in cancellation of awards and new awards were granted in the fourth quarter of and valued on the grant date based on underlying stock prices 
the higher expense in is primarily attributable to performance related vesting of restricted stock awards for executives based on achieving certain milestones associated with the bio synfining technology project and expense previously recognized reversed out for modifications to performance market based stock options 
the increased expense in resulted from a larger number of employees and executives receiving awards 
previously granted awards were also valued at higher prices based on the underlying stock prices of the company at the time of grant 
most of these awards have been cancelled due to termination of employees 
we expect equity compensation to remain similar to the expense in general and administrative and other 
the significant decrease in general and administrative expenses year over year results from our cost reduction plan put into place in the fourth quarter of this reduction primarily consists of decreased expenditures associated with overhead personnel  professional consultants  accountant fees  travel and insurance expenditures 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue at this decreased level throughout and do not expect increases in general and administrative expenses to occur upon commercialization of our technology 
we also incurred increased severance expense in and for future payments under retirement agreements with former officers and employees 
other income and expenses in thousands interest income other income expense foreign currency exchange minority interest income loss from discontinued operations 
table of contents interest income 
the decrease in interest income over the years is due to a lower average cash balance and declining interest rates on money market funds 
a majority of interest income is generated from money market accounts with our current cash balances 
other income expense and foreign exchange 
other income expense in and primarily consists of losses from our investment in dynamic fuels 
dynamic fuels losses result from project development  site selection  equipment evaluation  and government relations 
we expect the joint venture to capitalize costs associated with the construction of the plant and expect to see income from this investment in the second half of the loss in is attributable to an expense of  which was financing costs previously capitalized 
changes in the foreign currency exchange are due to fluctuation in the value of the australian dollar compared to the us dollar 
the foreign currency changes result from translation adjustments from our license with the commonwealth of australia which is denominated in australian dollars 
these changes have no current cash impact on us 
income loss from discontinued operations 
changes in income from discontinued operation primarily resulted from oil and gas proceeds received in the amount of  from the settlement of future payments that would have been calculated on first gross revenues from our international oil and gas assets in international oil and gas gains of  recognized for the sale of stock in our nigerian subsidiary for our interests in aje and ajapa assets in  this compares to amortization expense of  related to the termination of the stranded gas venture in  and an increase in impairment for domestic oil and gas assets sold in january of research and development decrease in expenditures for research and development activities associated with the demonstration plants due to completion of operations of plants in and offset by increased expenditures associated with laboratory facilities  personnel and termination expenditures in  a onetime gain in resulting from the extinguishment of debt related to the marathon note for the construction of the demonstration facility in the amount of  contributed to the income recognized in  and expenditures of  for activities at both pilot plant facilities for nine months of the year and additional expenses associated with increased staffing levels for operation of demonstration facilities in we will not incur further expenses related to our oil and gas activities in the future 
we do not expect to incur significant expenses related to our research and development activities in the future as all liabilities associated with the discontinuance of activities have been incurred in liquidity and capital resources general as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
our current liabilities totaled  as of december  at december   we had  in accounts receivable outstanding relating to our technical services revenue provided to dynamic fuels and other revenue 
we believe that all of the receivables currently outstanding will be collected and have not established a reserve for bad debts 
we have expended a significant amount of funds on the research and development of the syntroleum process and bio synfining technology  and will continue to spend significant amounts to develop our other commercial projects 
we are actively engaged in generating revenue through the license of our technology or transfer of our technology documentation 
we also intend to obtain additional funds through collaborative or other arrangements with strategic partners and others  and through debt and equity financing 
if we obtain additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to stockholders may occur 
in addition  preferred stock could be issued in the future without stockholder approval and the terms of the preferred stock could include dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting and other rights that are more favorable than the rights of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available 
we are currently exploring alternatives for raising capital to commercialize the growth of our businesses  including the formation of joint ventures and other strategic alliances 
if adequate funds are not available  or if we are not successful in establishing a strategic alliance  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate expenditures for our plant development and other activities or may seek to enter into a business combination transaction with or sell assets to another company 
we could also be forced to license to third parties the rights to commercialize additional products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves 
the transactions we outlined above may not be available to us when needed or on terms acceptable or favorable to us 

table of contents assuming the commercial success of the plants based on the syntroleum process  we expect that license fees  catalyst sales and sales of products from plants in which we own an interest will be a source of revenues 
in addition  we could receive revenues from other commercial projects we are pursuing 
however  we may not receive any of these revenues  and these revenues may not be sufficient for capital expenditures or operations and may not be received within the expected time frame 
if we are unable to generate funds from operations  our need to obtain funds through financing activities will be increased 
cash flows vs 
cash flows used in operations were  during the year ended december   compared to cash flows used in operations of  during the year ended december  the decrease in cash flows used in operations primarily results from lower cash used in continuing operations based on the new cost structure implemented by our management team in  increased cash revenues and the receipt of a non refundable advance payment of  recorded as deferred revenue 
we also decreased our cash used in discontinued operations of research and development activities in when compared to based on current executed agreements and management projections  we expect to receive cash flow from operating activities in future cash flows to be used in discontinued operations are expected to be minimal 
cash flows used in investing activities were  during the year ended december   compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of  during the year ended december  the change was primarily related to the capital contribution to our joint venture  dynamic fuels for initial construction costs in the amount of  this investment is offset by the sale of assets associated with our discontinued operations such as  receipt of payments of  from aeerl and the proceeds from the sale of the technology center of  we do not have any other assets for sale related to its discontinued operations 
we have committed to funding an additional  into dynamic fuels  in  if required 
we expect to utilize cash flows provided by operations and are currently exploring alternatives for other sources of funds for this investment 
cash flows used in financing activities during the year ended december  was compared to  provided by financing activities during the year ended december  the change in cash flows was primarily due to net proceeds received from a draw down of  under our common stock purchase agreement offset by the payment of liabilities associated with our international oil and gas assets 
vs 
cash flows used in operations were  during compared to  during the decrease primarily results from lower cash used in discontinued operations of research and development associated with the demonstration plants activities in when compared to cash flows associated with continuing operations remained relatively the same compared to the decreases in cash flows associated with expenses were offset by employee termination expenditures in connection with our reduction in force 
cash flows provided by investing activities were  during the year ended december   compared to cash flows used in investing activities of  during the year ended december  the change was primarily related to the receipt of payments of  from aaerl  offset by the investment in dynamic of  in  compared to the increase in oil and gas capital expenditures in  offset by the receipt in of proceeds of  for a note receivable 
cash flows provided by financing activities were  during the year ended december   compared to  provided by financing activities during the year ended december  the change in cash flows was primarily due to net proceeds received from a draw down of  under our common stock purchase agreement with azimuth offset by payments to marathon for early repayment of discounted debt and payments to join venturers in connection with termination of the stranded gas venture

we have entered into employment agreements  which provide severance cash benefits to several key employees 
commitments under these agreements totaled approximately  at december  expense is not recognized until an employee is severed 
the capital and working capital budget for dynamic fuels financing  construction and initial operations of the first plant to use the company s bio synfining technology is estimated to equal million in total 
dynamic fuels received approval from the louisiana state bond commission to sell million in gulf opportunity zone tax exempt bonds to partially finance the plant 
these bonds were sold on october   in the amount of million 
syntroleum and tyson made capital contributions in the amount of million each to satisfy current funding requirements for capital expenditures relating to procurement of long lead equipment and construction of the plant in july on july   both members approved plant sanction and committed collectively an additional million in in capital contributions for funding of the construction of the plant 
the remaining estimated million will be required to be funded proportionately in the second half of timing of funding is contingent based on cash needs during construction 
the funding in from syntroleum was paid out of available cash 
based on this timeline  the plant is expected to begin commercial operations by the second quarter of providing additional cash flow to syntroleum in the second half of both parties elected to proceed with the construction of the first plant in july of in accordance with the joint venture agreement 
if a member fails to make a capital contribution  it is in default  and its interest is diluted by per not contributed 
the other member can fund a portion of the default  which is considered a loan to the defaulting member at a rate of libor with a day cure period 
the defaulting member can make a full or partial loan repayment and a pro rata portion of lost interest will be restored 
if the loan is not repaid  it will be converted into ownership interest for the member making the loan  diluting the defaulting member at a per of the loan 
at this time no member is in default 
equity issuances on march   a draw down under our equity line of credit of million was consummated at an average stock price of per share 
on july   a second draw down of million was consummated at an average stock price of per share 
as an incentive to tyson for entering the dynamic fuels limited liability company agreement  tyson received warrants to buy our common stock 
the warrants are allocated in three tranches 
the first tranche of million shares was awarded upon signing of the llc agreement  feedstock and master license agreements in june the warrant agreement provides that the second tranche of million shares will be issued upon sanctioning of the second plant and the third tranche of million shares will be issued upon sanctioning of the third plant  provided that tyson has at least a interest in dynamic fuels 
the exercise price of the first tranche of million warrants is per share  which was the ten day average closing price prior to the signing of the above referenced agreements on june  the exercise price of the second and third tranches of warrants will be the ten day average closing price prior to the sanctioning of plants or vesting requires that tyson remain at least a equity owner in dynamic fuels in the case of the first tranche and in the applicable plant in the case of the second and third tranches  and that each plant has commenced commercial operation 
maturity of each tranche of warrants will be on the third anniversary of each respective plant s start up date of commercial operations 
if or more of the project cost for the third plant is debt financed  then the third warrant tranche will not vest 
in the event that tyson owns a or greater interest in dynamic fuels the number of shares subject to the second and third warrant tranche doubles subject to a limitation that tyson will not receive pursuant to all tranches warrants for stock equal to or more than of the outstanding shares of syntroleum common stock 
in the event tyson defaults by not paying its capital contributions to the plant  tyson loses the warrants for such plant

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe that the following items represent our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from technical services provided as time and expenses for services or support associated with a contract or license are incurred 
the license agreements require us to develop a site specific plant design in accordance with licensee specifications  this design package is called the process design package  or pdp  and allows for a percent cost recovery of services rendered 
technical service revenues resulted from the preparation of our process design package to dynamic fuels in and the preparation of our process design package includes engineering labor and necessary materials for completion of the package 
we expect to obtain revenues from the transfer of technology documentation to customers or through licensing structures 
any deposits or advance payments for the technology documentation is recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until recognized as revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company recognizes revenue on the transfer of technology documentation upon the physical transfer of the technology documentation by the company to the customer pursuant to the terms of the specific agreement 

table of contents deposits received from the sale of license agreements are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
percent of the license fee deposit is recorded as revenue when a site license agreement has been formally executed and we have delivered to the licensee the process design package for the licensee s initial licensed plant 
the remaining is recognized as revenue when the plant has passed the required operational tests 
if the years license agreements expire without construction of a plant  revenue is then recognized 
our current licenses generally begin to expire in we expect to recognize revenue for royalty fees associated with its licensees plants 
the royalties will be recognized upon production of finished product by the licensee 
we have provided synthetic ultra clean diesel fuel  such as its s diesel fuel and s jet fuel subject to certification  produced from natural gas and fc naphtha fuels to various customers for their use in further research and testing upon their request 
the ultra clean s diesel fuel and s jet fuel subject to certification is a paraffinic  high cetane distillate fuel that is essentially free of sulfur  olefins  metals  aromatics or alcohols 
the fuels have been produced at the catoosa demonstration facility 
revenues are recognized upon delivery of the requested fuels or achievement of specific deliverables and are recorded as other revenue 
we recognize revenues from joint development activities when contract deliverables are completed 
proceeds received prior to the completion of contractual obligations are deferred with revenues recognized upon the company s completion of its obligations specified under the contract 
substantially all of our joint development revenues during the periods presented have been from joint development activities with the department of energy doe and the department of defense dod 
all such joint development activities were pursuant to joint research and development agreements where we expense our research and development costs as incurred 
these projects require us to deliver results from development activities such as non proprietary analysis of plant processes  flow diagrams  chemical analysis and fuel production plans that will be jointly shared by each party 
the customers benefit from paying for these development activities as they are obtaining access to information pertaining to the syntroleum process 
revenue is recognized when final delivery of the shared technology has occurred 
these revenues are reported in income loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award generally three years using the straight line method 
non employee stock based compensation 
we also grant stock based incentives to certain non employees 
these stock based incentives are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task forces issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and with sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
stock awards that are tied to performance criteria are expensed at the time the performance goals are met 
asset retirement obligations 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the standard requires that we record the discounted fair value of the retirement obligation as a liability at the time the plants are constructed 
the asset retirement obligations consist primarily of costs associated with the future plant dismantlement of our pilot plants 
as the pilot plants are directly related to research and development activities and have been expensed accordingly  no corresponding amount is capitalized as part of the related property s carrying amount 
the liability accretes over time with a charge to accretion expense 
critical estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the more significant estimates made by management include  but are not limited to  the valuation of stock based compensation  estimates for accrued liabilities and estimates for asset retirement obligations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk margins for crude oil  natural gas  coal  vegetable oils and fats and other commodities create a market risk for economics associated with our syntroleum and synfining processes or bio synfining technology 
because the synthetic crude oil  liquid fuels and specialty products that plants utilizing the syntroleum and synfining processes or bio synfining technology are expected to produce will compete in markets with oil and refined petroleum products  and because natural gas  coal  biomass  fats or vegetable oils will be used as the feedstock for these plants  an increase in feedstock prices relative to prices for oil or refined products  or a decrease in prices for oil or refined products relative to feedstock prices  could adversely affect the operating results of these plants 
higher than anticipated costs for the catalysts and other materials used in these plants could also adversely affect operating results 
prices for oil  natural gas  coal  biomass  fats  greases  vegetable oils and refined products are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional capital to accomplish our business plan over the next several years 
we expect to obtain additional funding through debt or equity financing in the capital markets  joint ventures  license agreements  sale of assets and other strategic alliances  as well as various other financing arrangements 
if we obtain additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to stockholders may occur 
in addition  preferred stock could be issued in the future without stockholder approval  and the terms of our preferred stock could include dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting and other rights that are more favorable than the rights of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available
