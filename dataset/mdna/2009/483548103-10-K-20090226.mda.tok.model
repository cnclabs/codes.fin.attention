all years presented reflect the classification of kaman music s financial results as discontinued operations 
management overview during the past year our company has experienced a variety of significant developments  most notably several changes in senior leadership 
neal j 
keating has completed his first year of service as our chief executive officer  gregory l 
steiner was appointed president of kaman aerospace group and given responsibility for the management of all aerospace operations  and  most recently  william c 
denninger assumed the role of senior vice president and chief financial officer following the retirement of robert m 
garneau 
from an organizational perspective  recent acquisitions including the acquisition of brookhouse  the largest in our history and the settlement of our sh g helicopter contract with the royal australian navy have had a noticeable impact on our business 
since his arrival  mr 
steiner has established a senior level administrative team focused exclusively on our aerospace business 
we continue to explore other opportunities to realign the operations of our aerospace business in order to better leverage our investments  enhance our overall profitability  and better position ourselves to achieve our goal of sustainable growth in the evolving aerospace market 
we believe that by aligning the aerospace operations for growth and efficiency and eliminating organizational redundancies we will be able to improve our market focus and execute our strategies more successfully 
these changes have caused us to undertake an evaluation of our organizational and business structures  taking into consideration various internal and external developments over the past year 
we are also evaluating the nature of the financial data being reviewed by senior corporate management 
this has led us to consider  among other things  the level of detail and volume of such information  as well as the advantages to be gained by allocating corporate costs to each of our reporting segments 
these ongoing studies may lead to actions being taken that could result in a change to our segment reporting information during overview of business kaman corporation is composed of five business segments aerostructures  a subcontract supplier for commercial and military aircraft  precision products  a producer of fuzing devices and memory and measuring systems for a variety of applications  helicopters  a provider of upgrades and support for its existing fleet as well as a subcontractor for other aerospace manufacturers  specialty bearings  a manufacturer of high performance mechanical products used in aviation  marine  hydropower  and other industrial applications  and industrial distribution  the third largest power transmission motion control industrial distributor in north america 
the following is a summary of key events that occurred in our net sales from continuing operations increased in compared to our net earnings from continuing operations decreased in compared to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined to in  a decrease of compared to neal j 
keating became chief executive officer on january  and chairman on march  gregory l 
steiner was appointed president of our aerospace group on july  he has responsibility for all four of our aerospace reporting segments 
william c 
denninger was appointed senior vice president and chief financial officer on december  the industrial distribution and specialty bearings segments experienced strong growth in sales and operating profit 
our helicopters segment reached an agreement with the commonwealth of australia that terminated the sh g a super seasprite program  with a mutual release of claims 
on june   we acquired brookhouse holdings  limited brookhouse  a leader in the design and manufacture of composite aerostructures  aerospace tooling  and repair and overhaul services based in darwen  lancashire  united kingdom 
in  our industrial distribution segment completed the acquisitions of industrial supply corp 
isc of richmond  virginia and industrial rubber mechanics  incorporated inrumec of puerto rico 
we signed a contract with boeing for the air force s a re wing program  with a potential sales value of approximately million 
in august  we completed the purchase of the portion of the bloomfield campus that kaman aerospace corporation of which the helicopters segment forms a part had leased from navair for many years 
on october   we entered into a year term loan credit agreement with various banks for million 
results of continuing operations consolidated results net sales in thousands aerostructures precision products helicopters specialty bearings subtotal aerospace segments industrial distribution total change change the increase in net sales for compared to was attributable to organic growth in all reporting segments except the helicopters segment  as well as acquisitions in the aerostructures and industrial distribution segments 
in the aerospace businesses net sales increased due to the acquisition of brookhouse  as well as organic sales growth resulting mainly from increased shipments for the sikorsky blackhawk helicopter cockpit program and the jpf fuze program 
in the industrial distribution segment  sales to several new large national accounts  as well as the acquisition of isc and inrumec  contributed to the increase for compared to the growth in consolidated net sales for compared to was primarily due to increased shipments on several key product lines in our aerostructures  precision products and specialty bearing segments  which were driven by the strong commercial and military aerospace markets 
our industrial distribution segment experienced sales growth during as a result of several new national accounts and continued strength in the central and west regions 
gross profit in thousands gross profit change change of net sales gross profit for increased primarily due to the increased sales volume at the industrial distribution and specialty bearings segments and the absence of australia sh g a program charges  which amounted to million in these positive results were partially offset by a less favorable product mix for the precision products segment and the charges  excluding goodwill  recorded by the aerostructures segment  as discussed more fully below 
gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin decreased due to the aforementioned product mix changes at our precision products segment and the impact of the charges recorded at the aerostructures wichita facility 
the increase in the consolidated gross profit for was primarily attributable to sales growth in the industrial distribution and specialty bearings segments 
in addition  the accrued contract loss charge related to additional anticipated cost growth on our helicopters segment s australia program was million less in as compared to gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin improved slightly due to higher sales volume  increased efficiencies and a growing business base at all of our aerospace reporting segments 
selling  general administrative expenses s  g a in thousands s  g a change change of net sales the increase in s  g a for compared to is primarily due to the three acquisitions made during  increases related to higher personnel costs across most of the reporting segments as well as increased bid and proposal activity in the aerospace segments 
these increases were partially offset by lower expenses related to fringe benefits  incentive compensation and stock appreciation rights 
the increase in s  g a for compared to was primarily driven by our industrial distribution segment and corporate expenses 
our industrial distribution segment experienced higher operating expenses due to additional costs incurred for new branch openings and overall increased personnel costs 
corporate expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in stock compensation expense and higher group insurance expense 
total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased percentage points in compared to this was primarily due to greater sales volume as well as continued cost control efforts 
goodwill impairment during the second quarter of  our aerostructures wichita  kansas facility continued to experience production and quality issues  which  along with circumstances unique to each contract  resulted in the separate termination of two long term contracts with spirit aerosystems and shenyang aircraft corporation 
these contracts  which represented significant work for the facility  were both loss contracts 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of december and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
due to the loss of the two major contracts as well as the continuing production and quality issues  management performed a goodwill impairment analysis for this reporting unit as of june  although we believe we are working through the production issues at our aerostructures wichita facility  its carrying value had increased significantly during the second quarter of this  combined with our loss of two long term contracts and the quality and production issues at the facility  created a situation in which the estimated fair value of this reporting unit the legal entity plastic fabricating company  inc was less than its carrying value 
the resulting total non cash goodwill impairment charge was million  which represented the entire goodwill balance for this reporting unit prior to the charge 
this charge is not deductible for tax purposes and represents a discrete item in our second quarter effective tax rate 
operating income in thousands operating income change change of net sales the increase in operating income in compared to was due to increases in operating income at our specialty bearings  helicopters and industrial distribution segments and a decrease in corporate expenses 
these changes were partially offset by lower operating income at our aerostructures and precision products segments 
the increase in operating income at our specialty bearings  helicopters and industrial distribution segments was primarily a result of program developments and national accounts  as discussed further in the segment sections below  as well as the absence of million in charges related to the australia sh g a program recorded in please refer to the individual segment discussions for details on their operating income 
the increase in operating income for was primarily attributable to stronger operating results in all of our reporting segments within the aerospace industry as further discussed in the following sections 
our industrial distribution segment s operating income was lower in compared to partially as a result of a variety of expenses incurred for start up costs relative to several new national account contracts 
loss on ineffective hedge contracts in connection with the acquisition of brookhouse  we assumed two foreign currency hedge contracts originally intended to hedge forecasted cash flows on a significant us dollar denominated contract 
during the third quarter of  we determined these hedges were ineffective  due to a significant shift in the timing of the forecasted cash flows 
therefore  we cancelled the contracts during the third quarter  resulting in a loss of million being included in non operating income in our consolidated statements of operations 
interest expense  net net interest expense generally consists of interest charged on the revolving credit facility and other borrowings offset by interest income 
net interest expense for was million as compared to million in the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to the repayment of a significant portion of our revolving credit line as of december   using the proceeds from the sale of the music segment  as well as the redemption of all outstanding convertible debentures in late in the second quarter of  we borrowed against our revolving credit line again to fund working capital requirements and the brookhouse acquisition 
net interest expense for remained relatively flat compared to primarily due to there having been a similar level of borrowings during as compared to net interest expense in both years generally consisted of interest charged on the revolving credit facility and the convertible debentures offset by interest income 
effective income tax rate effective income tax rate the effective tax rate represents the combined federal  state and foreign tax effects attributable to pretax earnings for the year 
the increase in the effective tax rate for compared to is due to the non cash goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in the second quarter of for our aerostructures wichita facility 
the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by one time adjustments resulting from tax law changes in the us  as well as internationally  as compared to other matters the connecticut department of environmental protection ctdep has given us conditional approval for reclassification of groundwater in the vicinity of the moosup  ct facility consistent with the character of the area 
this facility is currently being held for disposal 
we have substantially completed the process of connecting neighboring properties to public drinking water in accordance with such approval and in coordination with the ctdep and local authorities 
we anticipate the water connection project will be completed in early site characterization of the environmental condition of the property began in and is expected to continue during in connection with the sale of the music segment in  we assumed responsibility for meeting certain requirements of the act that applied to our transfer of the new hartford  connecticut  facility leased by that segment for guitar manufacturing purposes ovation 
under the act  those responsibilities essentially consist of assessing the site s environmental conditions and remediating environmental impairments  if any  caused by ovation s operations prior to the sale 
the site is a multi tenant industrial park  in which ovation and other unrelated entities lease space 
the environmental assessment process began in and will continue during the estimate of our portion of the cost to assess the environmental conditions and remediate this site is million  unchanged from previously reported estimates 
in august  we completed the purchase of the portion of the bloomfield campus that kaman aerospace corporation of which the helicopters segment forms a part had leased from navair for many years 
in connection with the purchase  we have assumed responsibility for environmental remediation at the facility as may be required under the connecticut transfer act the transfer act and we continue the effort to define the scope of the remediation that will be required by the ctdep 
the transaction was recorded by taking the undiscounted remediation liability of  and discounting it at a rate of to its present value 
the fair value of the navy property asset  which approximates the discounted present value of the assumed environmental liability of  has been included in property  plant and equipment as of december  this remediation process will take many years to complete 
we have accrued million for environmental compliance at our recently acquired brookhouse facilities 
we are in the early stages of assessing the work that may be required  which may result in a change to this accrual 
combined aerospace segment results the following table presents selected financial data for our combined aerospace segments net sales aerostructures precision products helicopters specialty bearings total aerospace segments change change operating loss income aerostructures precision products helicopters specialty bearings total aerospace segments change change the market both the commercial and military aerospace markets remained strong during most of we believe this positive trend will continue for the military aerospace markets in  however  as a result of the downturn in the global economy  we do not foresee the commercial aerospace market continuing to perform at its levels 
we believe the effect of the downturn in the commercial aerospace market will be somewhat mitigated by our existing military work 
strategies kaman s strategies for the aerospace segments are aerostructures expand our global market position as a supplier of complex  composite and metallic structures and integrated subsystems for military and commercial aircraft 
precision products become the established leader in bomb and missile fuzes  specialized memory products  precision measuring devices and electro optic sensor systems for military and commercial applications 
helicopters leverage systems knowledge and lean manufacturing to take advantage of emerging assembly subcontracting and after market retrofit opportunities as helicopter prime manufacturers focus on system design  integration  and final assembly 
specialty bearings maintain leadership in product technical performance and application engineering support while staying ahead of the curve in product technology enhancement  lean manufacturing techniques and lead time reduction 
aerostructures segment in thousands net sales change change operating loss income change change of net sales backlog on contract the growth in net sales for compared to was partially attributable to million of sales by brookhouse  which was acquired in mid june the remainder of the sales growth was due to higher production levels for the sikorsky black hawk helicopter program at our jacksonville facility  offset partially by a decrease in sales at the aerostructures wichita facility due to the production and operational issues discussed below 
during  the segment delivered cockpits under the blackhawk helicopter program compared to cockpits delivered in the segment s operating income was significantly impacted by charges of million related to goodwill impairment and the write off of inventory and tooling costs at the aerostructures wichita facility 
the growth in net sales in compared to was primarily due to higher production levels and increased shipments to sikorsky for the black hawk helicopter program 
during  we delivered more cockpits than in additional sikorsky offload work  boeing shipments and other boeing commercial work also contributed to the increase in sales in operating income increased primarily as a result of greater sales volume for the sikorsky black hawk program 
these positive operating results were offset partially by certain adverse adjustments resulting from a rapid increase in manpower  production inefficiencies and excess inventory experienced at the aerostructures wichita facility during the ramp up of several programs discussed below 
major programs the sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program includes the installation of all wiring harnesses  hydraulic assemblies  control pedals and sticks  seat tracks  pneumatic lines  and the composite structure that holds the windscreen for cockpits on most models of the black hawk helicopter 
in june  sikorsky placed an order for an additional cockpits bringing total orders placed to date to cockpits 
the total potential value of this program is at least million  with deliveries on current orders continuing through through december   a total of cockpits had been delivered under this contract 
in mid july  the company signed a long term requirements contract with boeing for the production of wing control surfaces inboard and outboard flaps  slats and deceleron assemblies for the us air force s a fleet  with initial deliveries scheduled to begin in early full rate production is expected to begin in with an average of approximately shipsets per year through this multiyear contract has a potential value in excess of million  however  annual quantities will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders boeing receives from the us air force 
the production of structural wing subassemblies for the boeing c continues to be important in maintaining a sufficient business base at the jacksonville facility and will remain so until work under the a program ramps up in during  we received an order for an additional shipsets  which will extend production under this program through additionally  in late we signed a seven year follow on contract with boeing for the production of fixed wing trailing edge assemblies for the boeing and aircraft 
shipments under this program were delayed during the second half of the year  due to the international association of machinists iam strike at the boeing company 
although boeing was successful in reaching an agreement with the striking machinists  shipments remained behind schedule during the fourth quarter of at aerostructures wichita  we continue our efforts to implement corrective actions to resolve personnel  quality and production process issues 
these issues arose in connection with the facility s rapid expansion to accommodate the ramp up for three contracts awarded in  spirit aerosystems and shenyang aircraft corporation for the boeing dreamliner program and sikorsky aircraft corporation for the canadian mh helicopter program 
during  aerostructures wichita s lack of certification status for a large portion of the year adversely affected our ability to fully perform our obligations under certain contracts 
these circumstances  combined with other factors affecting specific programs  resulted in the termination of two of the contracts awarded in we received a notice from spirit aerosystems in june seeking a default termination of its contract 
management has cooperated with spirit to achieve the customer s production objectives while reserving our legal rights with respect to the appropriateness of the contract termination 
in addition  in july the shenyang contract was terminated under a mutually satisfactory arrangement that essentially waives all potential claims other than warranty items  if any 
this arrangement also provides compensation to aerostructures wichita for its tooling  which was transferred directly to boeing 
although both of these terminated programs were loss contracts  they were considered significant to the overall operating results of aerostructures wichita 
in addition to the loss of the two contracts  operating issues have led to an increase in inventories due to delays in shipments  higher obsolete inventory  continued inefficiencies in the production process  excess costs to perform additional quality procedures  and an insufficient business base to maintain our overhead structure at aerostructures wichita 
despite these issues  aerostructures wichita is making progress on the tail rotor pylon program for sikorsky s canadian mh helicopter program 
final assembly for this program is now being performed at the jacksonville facility 
this program has undergone numerous design changes directed by the customer  which have caused costs on this program to grow substantially  and they have reached the point where they exceed the proposed price for the contract 
at december   negotiation of this contract has not been finalized 
management believes these incremental costs are recoverable from the customer and that the upcoming contract negotiations will yield an acceptable overall price 
we believe aerostructures wichita is an important component of our strategy 
the facility  which is in a key location  provides skilled capability in the composites industry 
in addition  this facility has a structure that should allow us to become increasingly competitive as we work through our operational issues 
during  management responsibility for aerostructures wichita was consolidated with the management team at our jacksonville facility in order to share operational knowledge 
we hired key personnel  including the appointment of gregory l 
steiner as president of our aerospace group 
the customer who had put the facility on probation in the first quarter of subsequently permitted our resumption of production and shipments in the third quarter  however  that customer continues to require source inspections until all aspects of the corrective actions it has identified are satisfactorily completed 
we have invested significant time  resources and capital into this facility and  although there is still significant work to be done  we believe the right management team is in place to meet the challenges ahead 
brookhouse acquisition brookhouse  our uk based facility  was acquired in the second quarter of brookhouse designs and manufactures composite aerostructures  aerospace tooling  and performs repair and overhaul services 
this acquisition supports our overall aerospace strategy and it expands our presence on a number of additional platforms with solid growth prospects  including the airbus a family  airbus a  f joint strike fighter and eurofighter 
the tooling business adds significant capability to our portfolio and further diversifies our customer base  while the after market services business increases our capabilities in the repair and overhaul business 
precision products segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales backlog on contract the increase in net sales for compared to was primarily due to increased production and shipments of the jpf to the united states government usg as well as higher shipments on several legacy fuze programs 
the decrease in operating income for compared to was primarily due to lower foreign military sales of the jpf fuze under the current option 
the results also benefited from higher gross margins on the jpf facilitization program  which was essentially complete in early  and sales of mm products  a product line that was sold on december  the increase in sales for as compared to was primarily due to the higher volume of jpf program shipments to both us and foreign militaries as well as greater shipments of mm products 
the increase in operating income for was primarily due to the increased shipments to foreign allied militaries for the jpf program  greater sales on the jpf facilitization program as well as higher sales volume on several mm contracts 
major programs the jpf program continues to be one of the segment s most important programs and management believes that it has significant potential for growth 
the segment has been able to steadily ramp up production in the total value of jpf contracts awarded by the usg from inception of the program through december  is million 
this value primarily consists of options through under the original contract and various contract modifications  including a two phase facilitization contract modification and additional foreign military sales facilitated by the usg  as well as a variety of development and engineering contracts  along with special tooling and test equipment 
we expect we will continue production under the currently awarded options through and are currently working with the usg for follow on orders 
in  we achieved our desired production levels of more than  fuzes per quarter for the final three quarters of the year and were able to ship jpf fuzes to the usg in the required lot sizes 
this consistent production capability will allow us to meet our future delivery requirements to the usg and increase opportunities for sales to foreign customers 
our efforts to sell the jpf to foreign allied militaries are important to the ultimate success of this program and will allow us to generate further market penetration  increase sales and improve profitability 
we ship to foreign allied militaries under the usg contract as well as direct commercial sales 
typically  we cannot sell any fuzes to our foreign customers until we have met our usg requirements 
to date  we have sold smaller lots of fuzes to several foreign allied militaries 
the segment also has a significant amount of jpf fuze inventory that does not meet the usg s specifications 
since these fuzes meet the operational requirements of non us militaries  we are actively marketing them and have received a small number of orders 
we also continue to work with the usg to negotiate further price increases  which will lead to improved profitability on this program 
we believe we have made meaningful progress on this program and we continue to work to ensure its overall success 
during  we continued to make progress on production improvements and enhancements of the jpf fuze system 
the facilitization program has contributed to our increased production and has been another important element of our strategy to improve our quality and efficiency on the jpf program 
the facilitization program provided us an opportunity to review production workflow to create greater efficiencies  qualify a second kaman site middletown for full production of jpf fuzes  and create an enhanced fuze design 
the enhanced design is expected to reduce the number of technical issues so a more steady state of production can be achieved more efficiently 
during the first quarter of  we passed the final tests necessary to begin production of the fuze under the enhanced design 
we are scheduled to begin production of the enhanced design fuzes at the middletown facility during the first quarter of and kpp orlando during the second quarter of we believe the value of these initiatives will be more fully realized in and beyond 
warranty and contract related matters there continues to be two warranty related matters that impact the fmu program at kpp orlando 
the items involved are an impact switch  embedded in certain bomb fuzes  that was recalled by a supplier and an incorrect part  called a bellows motor  found to be contained in bomb fuzes manufactured for the us army utilizing systems which originated before kpp orlando was acquired by kaman 
the us army sustainment command usasc  the procurement agency that administers the fmu contract  had authorized warranty rework for the bellows motor matter in late early  however  we were not permitted to finish the rework due to issues raised by the usasc primarily related to administrative matters and requests for verification of the accuracy of test equipment which accuracy was subsequently verified 
in late  the usasc informed us that it was changing its remedy under the contract from performance of warranty rework to an equitable adjustment of million to the contract price 
we responded  explaining our view that we had complied with contract requirements 
in june  the usasc affirmed its position but rescinded its million demand stating that its full costs had not yet been determined and gave instructions for disposition of the subject fuzes  including both the impact switch and bellows motor related items  to a navy facility and we complied with that direction 
to date  usasc has not made a demand for any specific amount 
as reported previously  a separate contract dispute between kpp orlando and the usasc relative to the fmu fuze program is now in litigation 
usasc has basically alleged the existence of latent defects in certain fuzes due to unauthorized rework during production and has sought to revoke their acceptance 
management believes that the precision products segment has performed in accordance with the contract and it is the government that has materially breached its terms  as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we cancelled the contract and in january  we commenced litigation before the armed services board of contract appeals the board requesting a declaratory judgment that our cancellation was proper 
at about the same time  the usasc notified us that it was terminating the contract for default  making the allegations noted above  and we filed a second complaint with the board appealing that termination decision 
the litigation process continues 
helicopters segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales backlog on contract sales for the helicopters segment were comprised primarily of the upgrade and maintenance program for egypt  subcontract work for sikorsky and mdhi and sh g program spare parts 
the decrease in sales for compared to was primarily due to the termination of the production and service contract related to the australian sh g a super seasprite program  as well as work performed for egypt in that was not repeated during and lower sh program spare parts sales 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales for sikorsky and mdhi 
operating income increased primarily due to the absence of an accrued contract loss charge for the australia program in as well as higher gross margins on subcontract sales 
australian program charges were million in the decrease in the backlog on contract is a result of the termination of the sh g a super seasprite program with the commonwealth of australia 
see below for further discussion of the termination of this program 
the higher sales for our helicopters segment during as compared to were a result of a greater volume of work on the depot level maintenance and upgrade program for the egyptian sh g e aircraft and the sikorsky black hawk helicopter program 
the sikorsky program involves fuselage joining and installation tasks along with various mechanical subassemblies 
the increase in operating income for was primarily driven by lower charges on the australian program during as compared to as well as increased sales volume 
total charges on the australian program in were million 
major programs the company and the commonwealth of australia entered a settlement agreement during the first quarter of that terminated the sh g a super seasprite program on mutually agreed terms 
the agreement provided for a transfer of ownership to the company of the sh g a super seasprite helicopters along with spare parts and associated equipment  after which proceeds from the sale of these items would be shared on a predetermined basis 
this transfer of ownership occurred on february  the transfer date 
in connection with sharing sale proceeds  we have agreed that total payments of at least million aus will be made to the commonwealth regardless of sales  with at least million aus to be paid by march  and  to the extent cumulative payments have not yet reached million aus  additional payments of million aus each in march of and during the fourth quarter of  we entered into forward contracts for the purpose of hedging these required payments 
these contracts cover million aus of the million aus in required payments and have been accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
see note  derivative financial instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
to secure these payments  the company provided the commonwealth with a million aus unconditional letter of credit on the transfer date 
this letter of credit will be reduced as such payments are made 
additionally  under the settlement agreement  the company forgave payment of approximately million in net unbilled receivables in exchange for the helicopters  spare parts and equipment  which will be recorded as inventory on the transfer date  at a value representing the net unbilled receivables and the guaranteed payments  described above 
management has determined that the value of this transferred inventory exceeds the amount of the net unbilled receivables and the guaranteed payments 
we do not currently expect the transfer to have a material impact on our statement of operations 
the termination of the contract  combined with the return of inventory  will result in our inability to claim look back interest from the irs  previously expected to exceed million pretax 
additionally  sales relative to the service center  which had been a meaningful portion of helicopters segment net sales in recent years  ended at the conclusion of the support center ramp down period  which occurred during the fourth quarter of in anticipation of the successful transfer of the helicopters  segment management has attended trade events  obtained marketing licenses required by the usg and has begun discussions with many potential foreign government buyers of the helicopters 
we continue our work under a program for depot level maintenance and upgrades for nine sh g e helicopters delivered to the egyptian government during the s 
through december   we are on contract for approximately million of work related to maintenance and upgrades 
this program has a potential total contract value of approximately million 
the segment also continues to perform subcontract work for sikorsky involving fuselage joining and installation tasks and the production of certain mechanical subassemblies and for mdhi in regard to rotor blade system deliveries 
these programs have been important elements of our business base over the recent past 
during  we continued to work under a contract from the army material research development and engineering command for follow on work associated with development of the burro unmanned resupply helicopter  utilizing the k max helicopter 
in january  the segment and lockheed  under our previously disclosed agreement  jointly acquired three k max helicopters from a us government general services administration auction for an average cost of million 
two of the aircraft were purchased by lockheed and the third is owned by the company 
the aircraft are being used to further develop the burro program 
in august  the company completed its purchase of the portion of the bloomfield campus kaman aerospace corporation of which the helicopters segment forms a part had leased from navair for many years 
in connection with the purchase  we have assumed responsibility for environmental remediation at the facility as may be required under the connecticut transfer act the act and we continue the effort to define the scope of the remediation that will be required by the connecticut department of environmental protection ctdep 
management believes the fair value of the property of million approximated the discounted present value of the cost of the environmental remediation at the date of purchase 
this remediation process will take many years to complete 
specialty bearings segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales backlog on contract the increase in net sales for as compared to was a result of higher shipments in the commercial jet liner market including the aftermarket  regional jet market and helicopter market  our kaflex product line and a favorable foreign currency rate change 
the euro exchange rate in had a favorable impact on net sales of approximately compared to operating income for increased primarily due to the increased sales volume  which allows us to leverage our fixed costs  and continued lean manufacturing improvements on the production line 
the increase in net sales during as compared to was primarily attributable to higher shipments to customers principally in the regional jet market and military aircraft market  as well as  strong growth in the commercial aftermarket and engine market 
to a lesser extent  the increase in sales was also attributable to the currency translation effect on the euro  which positively affected the us dollar value of sales reported by our germany facility 
operating income increased primarily due to the increased sales volume  continued lean improvements on the production line and higher absorption of s  g a expenses during as compared to major programs the aerospace market continued to be strong through the fourth quarter of although our results were slightly impacted by the boeing strike that was settled in the fourth quarter of there was a delay of approximately one month in the production schedule for boeing programs due to the impact of the strike 
the current economy creates an uncertain environment for our customers and many have already been  and will continue to be  impacted 
we anticipate the business jet market will decline in as well as work for the commercial aftermarket as air travel lessens 
although we are watchful of the current economic situation  our diverse customer mix provides us some degree of stability in the changing economy 
our backlog remains strong although we believe many customers are being more cautious with long lead orders 
we continue to focus on our strategy to provide a high quality product with shorter lead times than our competitors  to customers in both the commercial and military markets 
although there is increasing competition  we believe the technological enhancements we make to our current products  as well as the development of new products  will preserve our competitive advantages  increase our customer base  and lead to further penetration of both domestic and foreign markets 
industrial distribution segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales the increase in net sales during as compared to was due to a balance of organic growth and the contribution of the two acquisitions during the year  representing approximately million in sales 
the remaining increase was due to higher sales to new national accounts  some of which were ramping up during this sales growth was partially offset by the slowing industrial market and uncertain economy  particularly in the latter half of the fourth quarter of during the year  we continued to make investments in infrastructure and opened three new branches and one new distribution center in the united states 
as previously disclosed  these investments in infrastructure and personnel have had an impact on our operating income and it will take several years for the benefits of these investments to be fully realized 
operating income increased for compared to primarily due to the increase in organic sales volume primarily in the first nine months of the year 
results for the fourth quarter of were significantly impacted by the rapid decline in sales to oems and a deterioration in capital spending by maintenance  repair and overhaul mro organizations 
the increase in net sales during as compared to was primarily due to the ramp up of national account business  as well as continued strength in the energy and power generation  mining and oil exploration and food processing industries 
during  despite the increase in sales volume and the associated increase in gross margin  we experienced a decrease in operating income compared to the decrease was partially attributable to additional start up costs for new branch openings and other implementation costs we incurred to support several new national account contracts awarded in and late additionally  during we experienced an increase in overall operating expenses and higher personnel costs primarily driven by increased headcount necessary to support our growing business base 
industrial distribution trends the market because of our diverse customer base  our performance tends to track the us industrial production index 
we are therefore affected  to a large extent  by the overall business climate for our customer industries and their plant capacity utilization levels  and the effect of pricing spikes and or supply interruptions for basic commodities such as steel and oil 
the strength of certain markets varied considerably by industry type during while certain markets and products  such as paper manufacturing and food and beverage processing  remain steady  other industries have experienced a decline  including metal and machinery manufacturing  and more recently mining 
our business has been adversely impacted by the downturn in these industries  however  we are taking action to mitigate these negative trends through measured and appropriate cost cutting activities  continued focus on our acquisition strategy and initiatives aimed at improving both our gross and operating margins 
our strategy the primary strategy for the industrial distribution segment is to expand our geographic footprint in major industrial markets to enhance our position in the competition for regional and national accounts 
in order to increase our geographic footprint  we continue to explore potential acquisition candidates as well as establish branches in locations that are consistent with our strategic objectives 
by so doing  we will more clearly establish our business as one that can provide comprehensive services to our customers who are continually looking to streamline their procurement operations and consolidate supplier relationships 
during  we made two strategic acquisitions of isc  in march  and inrumec  in october 
both of these acquisitions will allow us to compete in new markets and offer new products to our current customers 
they also increase our size and therefore our ability to take advantage of strategic buying and rebates 
broaden our product offerings to gain additional business from existing customers and new opportunities from a wider slice of the market 
in recent years  we have worked to increase market share in several growing markets including the mining  energy and food and beverage industries 
we are also expanding our presence in the energy and utilities markets  two other less cyclical industries 
we believe we have been successful in this endeavor  as evidenced by our national account wins  and continue to target these industries 
we also continued to build our government business group to service our recently awarded year contract with the general services administration center for facilities maintenance and hardware gsa which allows us to supply government agencies with mro products from our major product categories 
liquidity and capital resources discussion and analysis of cash flows we assess the company s liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund working capital  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from or used by operating activities  capital expenditures  investments in our business segments and their programs  acquisitions  divestitures  dividends  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and factors that might otherwise affect the company s business and operations generally  as described under the heading risk factors and forward looking statements in item a of part i of this form k 
we continue to rely upon bank financing as an important source of support for our business activities including several recent acquisitions 
we believe this  when combined with cash generated from operating activities  will be sufficient to support our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate a variety of items will have an impact on our liquidity during the next months  aside from our normal working capital requirements 
these may include the resolution of any of the matters described in management s discussion and analysis  including the fmu contract litigation  the letter of credit to guarantee payments to the commonwealth  the cost of environmental remediation associated with the purchase of the navair property  the operational issues at the aerostructures wichita facility  and future supplemental employees retirement plan serp payments and required pension contributions 
however  we do not believe any of these matters will lead to a shortage of capital resources or liquidity that would prevent us from continuing with our business operations as expected 
we are watchful of the recent developments in the credit markets and are assessing the impact the current economic downturn may have on the company 
although we had recent success in executing a term loan credit agreement  the current market may restrict or prohibit us from securing the additional financing necessary to continue with our growth strategy and finance working capital requirements 
the trends in the market may have an impact on the company through lower customer spending as well as higher interest rates on borrowings going forward 
additionally  with the significant downturn in the current financial markets  our pension plan assets have significantly decreased  resulting in higher pension plan contributions and the expectation of a significant increase in pension expense in see note  pension plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for further information 
a summary of our consolidated cash flows from continuing operations is as follows vs 
vs 
in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash used in operating activities increased million in compared to this increase in cash used is primarily attributable to increased cash requirements to fund working capital needs in as compared to as specifically discussed below inventory levels increased in the helicopters segment  primarily due to the acquisition of a k max aircraft  and in the aerostructures segment  primarily due to higher amounts of inventory at the aerostructures wichita facility 
inventory has also increased at our precision products segment  although it is anticipated that the jpf inventory  the largest driver of this increase  will decrease in as additional progress payments are billed and as more fuzes are shipped 
higher payments of prior year accrued fringe benefits and incentive compensation during total cash payments for income taxes increased significantly  primarily due to the taxes paid on the gain resulting from the music segment sale 
the company paid out a significant amount of serp payments in compared to primarily attributable to the retirement of the former chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
net cash used in investing activities increased million in compared to the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of brookhouse and isc during the second quarter of and the acquisition of inrumec during the fourth quarter of  the absence of cash inflows from the sale of our former music segment in  and the increase in capital expenditures at the specialty bearings  aerostructures and industrial distribution segments 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million in compared to we had net borrowings under the revolving credit agreement of million for as compared to repayments of million for the significant change was driven by the issuance of long term debt in and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  offset partially by the payment of dividends 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in compared to due to changes in accounts receivable and inventory 
we generated a significant amount of cash from accounts receivable in compared to  primarily due to considerable cash collections in our aerostructures and helicopters segments for several key programs 
this was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable at our precision products and industrial distribution segments  primarily due to increased sales volume in the latter portion of the year 
inventory increased significantly  most notably in our aerostructures segment as it ramped up for new programs 
total investing activity for included cash proceeds from the divestiture of our music segment of million as well as cash proceeds from the sale of the mm assets of million 
cash outflows for investing activities related primarily to capital expenditures within all the reporting segments 
each segment s capital expenditures were considered essential to continue to ramp up for new programs  have the tools necessary to effectively compete in the marketplace and have the capacity necessary to meet our customers expectations 
additionally  the industrial distribution segment purchased the final interest in delamac de mexico sa de sa in the first quarter of for million 
we used a portion of the cash proceeds from the music transaction to pay down all of the balance owed under our revolving credit agreement  except for our euro note  at the end of other financing cash outflows related primarily to payment of the quarterly dividend 
financing arrangements we maintain a million revolving credit facility revolving credit agreement expiring august  the facility includes the availability of funding in foreign currencies as well as an accordion feature that provides the company the opportunity to request  subject to bank approval  an expansion of up to million in the overall size of the facility 
a significant amount of this facility was used to fund the acquisition of brookhouse in the second quarter of on october   we executed a term loan credit agreement term loan agreement with the bank of nova scotia  bank of america  na  fifth third bank  and rbs citizens  na collectively the banks 
the term loan agreement  which is in addition to our current revolving credit agreement  is a million facility with a four year term  including quarterly payments of principal at the rate of with of the initial aggregate principal payable in the final quarter 
we may increase the term loan  up to an aggregate of million with additional commitments from banks or new commitments from acceptable financial institutions 
additionally  the covenants required are the same as those in place under the revolving credit agreement 
in conjunction with this agreement  the current revolving credit agreement was amended to acknowledge the existence of the term loan credit agreement and adopt certain provisions of the term loan credit agreement 
total average bank borrowings for were million compared to million for as of december   there was million available for borrowing under the revolving credit agreement  net of letters of credit 
letters of credit are generally considered borrowings for purposes of the revolving credit agreement 
a total of million in letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement at december   million of which was related to the australia sh g a program 
in connection with the ownership transfer that occurred on february   we cancelled these letters of credit and issued a new letter of credit for the previously described guaranteed minimum payment of million aus 
facility fees and interest rates under the revolving credit agreement are determined on the basis of the company s credit rating from standard poor s 
in june  standard poor s re affirmed the company s rating as investment grade bbb with an outlook of stable 
we believe this is a favorable rating for a company of our size 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  if this rating should decrease  the effect would be to increase facility fees as well as the interest rates charged 
the financial covenants related to the revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement include a requirement that the company have i ebitda  at least equal to percent of net interest expense  on the basis of a rolling four quarters and ii a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to total capitalization of not more than percent 
the agreement also incorporates a financial covenant which provides that if the company s ebitda to net interest expense ratio is less than to  the ratio of i accounts receivable and inventory for certain kaman subsidiaries to ii the company s consolidated total indebtedness cannot be less than to we remained in compliance with those financial covenants as of and for the year ended december  other sources uses of capital for  we will make a contribution of approximately million to our tax qualified defined benefit pension plan  and approximately million in serp payments 
for the plan year  we made cash contributions of approximately million to our tax qualified defined benefit pension plan 
additionally during  we paid approximately million in serp payments  a large portion of which were made in february and august to our former chief executive officer for his final lump sum serp payment and in november to our former chief financial officer 
for the plan year  we made a cash contribution of million to our tax qualified defined benefit pension plan and million in payments for our serp 
in november  the company s board of directors approved a replenishment of the company s stock repurchase program  providing for repurchase of an aggregate of million common shares for use in administration of the company s stock plans and for general corporate purposes 
there were no shares repurchased during at december   approximately million shares were authorized for purchase under this program

critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosures based upon historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant 
we are also responsible for evaluating the propriety of our estimates  judgments  and accounting methods as new events occur 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management periodically reviews the company s critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the most significant areas currently involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
long term contracts methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions for long term aerospace contracts  we generally recognize sales and income based on the percentage of completion method of accounting  which allows for recognition of revenue as work on a contract progresses 
we recognize sales and profit based upon either the cost to cost method  in which profit is recorded based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs to complete the contract  or the units of delivery method  in which sales are recognized as deliveries are made and cost of sales is computed on the basis of the estimated ratio of total cost to total sales 
management performs detailed quarterly reviews of all of our long term contracts 
based upon these reviews  we record the effects of adjustments in profit estimates each period 
if at any time management determines that in the case of a particular contract total costs will exceed total contract revenue  we record a provision for the entire anticipated contract loss at that time 
the percentage of completion method requires that we estimate future revenues and costs over the life of a contract 
revenues are estimated based upon the original contract price  with consideration being given to exercised contract options  change orders and in some cases projected customer requirements 
contract costs may be incurred over a period of several years  and the estimation of these costs requires significant judgment based upon the acquired knowledge and experience of program managers  engineers  and financial professionals 
estimated costs are based primarily on anticipated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
the complexity of certain programs as well as technical risks and the future availability of materials and labor resources could affect the company s ability to estimate future contract costs 
while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to calculate our long term revenues and costs  estimating the percentage of work complete on certain programs is a complex task 
as a result  changes to these programs could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
these programs include the sikorsky canadian mh program  the sikorsky black hawk program  the jpf program  and several other programs including the boeing a program 
estimating the ultimate total cost of these programs has been challenging partially due to the complexity of the programs  the ramping up of the new programs  the nature of the materials needed to complete these programs  change orders related to the programs and the need to manage our customers expectations 
these programs are an important element in our continuing strategy to increase operating efficiencies and profitability as well as broaden our business base 
management continues to monitor and update program cost estimates quarterly for these contracts 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivable balance 
these estimates are based on known past due amounts and historical write off experience  as well as trends and factors impacting the credit risk associated with specific customers 
in an effort to identify adverse trends for trade receivables  we perform ongoing reviews of account balances and the aging of receivables 
amounts are considered past due when payment has not been received within a pre determined time frame based upon the credit terms extended 
for our government and commercial contracts  we evaluate  on an ongoing basis  the amount of recoverable costs 
the recoverability of costs is evaluated on a contract by contract basis based upon historical trends of payments  program viability and the customer s credit worthiness 
write offs are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts only after we have exhausted all collection efforts 
actual write offs and adjustments could differ from the allowance estimates due to unanticipated changes in the business environment as well as factors and risks associated with specific customers 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was percent and percent of gross receivables  respectively 
receivables written off  net of recoveries  in and were and million  respectively 
currently we do not believe that we have a significant amount of risk relative to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a increase in the allowance would have a million effect on pre tax earnings 
inventory valuation methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have four types of inventory a merchandise for resale  b contracts in process  c other work in process  and d finished goods 
merchandise for resale is stated at the lower of the cost of the inventory or its fair market value 
contracts in process  other work in process and finished goods are valued at production cost comprised of material  labor and overhead  including general and administrative expenses on certain government contracts 
contracts in process  other work in process  and finished goods are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we include raw material amounts in the contracts in process and other work in process balances 
raw material includes certain general stock materials but primarily relates to purchases that were made in anticipation of specific programs that have not been started as of the balance sheet date 
the total amount of raw material included in these in process amounts is less than of the total inventory balance for and the process for evaluating inventory obsolescence or market value issues often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
we adjust our inventory by the difference between the estimated market value and the actual cost of our inventory to arrive at net realizable value 
changes in estimates of future sales volume may necessitate future write downs of inventory value 
based upon a market evaluation performed in we wrote down our k max inventory by million in that year 
the k max inventory balance  consisting of work in process and finished goods  was million as of december  we believe that it is stated at net realizable value  although lack of demand for spare parts in the future could result in additional write downs of the inventory value 
overall  management believes that our inventory is appropriately valued and not subject to further obsolescence in the near term 
inventory valuation at our industrial distribution segment generally requires less subjective management judgment than the valuation of certain inventory in the four reporting segments that comprise the aerospace businesses 
management reviews the k max inventory balance on an annual basis to determine whether any additional write downs are necessary 
if such a write down were to occur  this could have a significant impact on our operating results 
a write down in this inventory at december   would have affected pre tax earnings by approximately million in vendor incentives methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions our industrial distribution segment enters into agreements with certain vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates that are generally earned upon achieving specified volume purchasing 
the rebate percentages may increase or decrease based upon the amount of inventory purchased or sold annually 
each program is analyzed and reviewed each quarter to determine the appropriateness of the projected annual rebate 
historically  differences between our estimates and actual rebates subsequently received have not been material 
we recognize rebate income relative to specific rebate programs as a reduction of the cost of inventory based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress toward earning the rebate  provided that the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
our participation in these types of programs is an important element of our industrial distribution segment business 
these types of programs are common in distribution businesses 
although we believe we will continue to receive vendor incentives  there is no assurance that our vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of rebates in the future 
also  we cannot estimate whether we will continue to utilize the vendor programs at the same level as in prior periods 
if we were to reduce our participation in vendor incentive programs  this could have a significant impact on our operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and certain intangible assets that have indefinite lives are evaluated at least annually for impairment 
all intangible assets are also reviewed for possible impairment whenever changes in conditions indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the annual evaluation is generally performed during the fourth quarter  based on the initial annual forecast information 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its carrying value 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets having indefinite lives was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  net  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of million of goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended december  based upon its annual evaluation  management has determined that there has been no further impairment of its goodwill balances 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon factors such as projected sales and growth rates  discount rates and other elements requiring significant judgments 
the discount rates we utilize reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets and specifically in our internally developed earnings projections 
we utilize currently available information regarding present industry and economic conditions and future expectations to prepare our estimates and perform impairment evaluations 
we do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions or if current economic conditions persist  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
based upon our analysis  a percentage point increase in the discount rate used would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment 
additionally  a percent decrease in the fair value of our reporting units also would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment 
self insured retentions liabilities methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have varying levels of deductibles for losses related to health  workers compensation  auto and product general liability claims 
to limit our exposure to these claims we obtain third party insurance coverage 
our total liability deductible for workers compensation is limited to million per claim and for general liability and auto liability  we are limited to million per claim 
the cost of such benefits is recognized as expense based on claims filed in each reporting period and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported ibnr during such period 
the estimates for the cost of the claims are based upon information provided to us by the claims administrators and are periodically revised to reflect changes in loss trends 
our ibnr estimate is based upon historical trends 
liabilities associated with these claims are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future losses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and the possibility that actuarial assumptions could change 
such self insurance accruals likely include claims for which the losses will be settled over a period of years 
the financial results of the company could be significantly affected if future claims and assumptions differ from those used in determining these liabilities 
if more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increases beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our self insurance reserve would affect our pre tax earnings by million 
long term incentive programs methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions the company maintains a stock incentive plan  which provides for share based payment awards  including non statutory stock options  restricted stock  stock appreciation rights  and long term incentive program ltip awards 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using a black scholes model 
we determine the fair value of our restricted share awards at the date of grant using an average of the high and low market price of our stock 
ltip awards provide certain senior executives an opportunity to receive award payments  generally in cash 
for each performance cycle  the company s financial results are compared to the russell indices for the same periods based upon the following a average return on total capital  b earnings per share growth and c total return to shareholders 
no awards will be payable unless the company s performance is at least in the th percentile of the designated indices 
the maximum award is payable if performance reaches the th percentile of the designated indices 
awards for performance between the th and th percentiles are determined by straight line interpolation 
awards will be paid out at at the th percentile 
in order to estimate the liability associated with ltip awards  management must make assumptions as to how our current performance compares to current russell data based upon the russell s historical results 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 
when sufficient russell data for a year is available  which typically will not be until april or may of the following year  management will adjust the liability to reflect its best estimate of the total award 
actual results could differ significantly from management s estimates 
the total liability as of december  was million 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
our long term incentive plan requires management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving long term company goals as well as estimate the impact the russell results may have on our accrual 
we do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   would have affected net earnings by approximately million in due to the timing of availability of the russell data  there is a risk that the amount we have recorded as ltip expense could be different from the actual payout 
a percentage point increase in the total performance factor earned for our ltip would result in a reduction of pretax earnings of million 
pension plans methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan for our full time us employees with the exception of certain acquired companies that have not adopted the plan as well as a non qualified supplemental employees retirement plan serp for certain key executives 
expenses and liabilities associated with each of these plans are determined based upon actuarial valuations 
integral to these actuarial valuations are a variety of assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rate and rate of increase in compensation levels 
we regularly review these assumptions  which are updated at the measurement date  december st  and disclosed in note  pension plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the impact of differences between actual results and the assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods  which will affect expense recognized in future periods 
we believe that two assumptions  the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
the discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension obligation 
for  management reviewed the citigroup pension discount curve and liability index to determine the continued appropriateness of our discount rate assumptions 
this index was designed to provide a market average discount rate to assist plan sponsors in valuing the liabilities associated with postretirement obligations 
additionally  we reviewed the change in the general level of interest rates since the last measurement date noting that overall rates had decreased since based upon this information  we used a percent discount rate as of december  for the qualified benefit pension plan 
this rate takes into consideration the participants in our pension plan and the anticipated payment stream as compared to the citigroup index and rounds the results to the nearest fifth basis point 
for the serp  we used the same methodology as the pension plan and derived a discount rate of percent in for the benefit obligation 
the qualified defined benefit pension plan and serp used discount rates of percent and percent  respectively at december  for purposes of calculating the benefit obligation 
the difference in the discount rates is primarily due to the expected duration of serp payments  which is shorter than the anticipated duration of benefit payments to be made to the average participant in the pension plan 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated benefit payments 
the expected return on assets assumption is developed based upon several factors 
such factors include current and expected target asset allocation  our historical experience of returns by asset class type  a risk premium and an inflation estimate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension expense in by million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension expense in by million 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense 
the expected return on plan assets was percent for december  a one percentage point increase decrease in the assumed return on pension plan assets assumption would have changed pension expense in by approximately million 
income taxes methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions tax laws in certain of our operating jurisdictions require items to be reported for tax purposes at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements 
one example of such temporary differences is depreciation expense 
other differences are permanent  such as expenses that are never deductible on our tax returns  an example being a charge related to the impairment of goodwill 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment is not yet due or the realized tax benefit of expenses we have already reported in our tax returns  but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
as of december   we had recognized million of net deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
the realization of these benefits is dependent in part on future taxable income 
for those foreign countries or us states where the expiration of tax loss or credit carry forwards or the projected operating results indicates that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
management believes that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax assets  net of valuation allowances recorded 
the realization of these deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was percent for our effective tax rate is based on expected or reported income or loss  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are valid and defensible  we believe that certain positions may not prevail if challenged 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit or changes in tax legislation 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate 
this rate is then applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
the company anticipates that total unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by million due to settlements of tax examinations within the next twelve months 
we file tax returns in numerous us and foreign jurisdictions  with returns subject to examination for varying periods  but generally back to and including it is our policy to record interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income taxes 
a one percent change to our tax rate would affect our earnings by million 
derivatives and hedging methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we use derivatives to manage risks related to foreign exchange and our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 
accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that  at inception and over the term of the arrangement  the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting 
the rules and interpretations related to derivative accounting are complex 
if a derivative does not meet the complex requirements established as a prerequisite for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value of the derivative must be reported in earnings rather than as a component of other comprehensive income  without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting  we first determine whether the relationship meets the strict criteria to qualify for exemption from ongoing effectiveness testing 
for a relationship that does not meet these criteria  we test effectiveness at inception and quarterly thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset  within a specified range  changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
this test is conducted each reporting period 
if fair value changes fail this test  we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively 
fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating market based assumptions 
at december   derivative assets were million and we had recorded million  net of tax  in other comprehensive income 
the amount recorded to other comprehensive income would have been recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  had the criteria for hedge accounting not been met 
changes in the fair value of these instruments will be recorded to other comprehensive income until the point where either the company stops utilizing the derivative instruments as a hedge or the derivative instruments no longer provide an effective hedge against the impact of foreign currency changes on the underlying transaction 
further information about our use of derivatives is provided in note  derivative financial instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
environmental costs methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations 
as a result  we have established and update  as necessary  policies relating to environmental standards of performance for our operations worldwide 
when we become aware of an environmental risk  we perform a site study to ascertain the potential magnitude of contamination and the estimated cost of remediation 
this cost is accrued using a reasonable discount factor based on the estimated future cost of remediation 
in  the primary accrual for remediation related to our purchase of the navy property as more fully discussed in note  environmental costs  and note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we continually evaluate the identified environmental issues to ensure the time to complete the remediation and the total cost of remediation are consistent with our initial estimate 
if there is any change in the cost and or timing of remediation  the accrual is adjusted accordingly 
environmental costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
liabilities with fixed or readily determinable payment dates are discounted 
at december   amounts accrued for known environmental remediation costs were million 
a change in this accrual could have impacted pre tax earnings by million
