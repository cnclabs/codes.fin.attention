in addition  we generate revenue from cost per action events that take place on our distribution network

additionally  we sell pay per click contextual advertising placements on specialized vertical and branded partner web sites  on a pay per click basis 
advertisers can target the placements by category  site or page specific basis

presentation of financial reporting periods the comparative periods presented are for the years ended december   and revenue we currently generate revenue through our suite of services  including our local search network  private label local online advertising platform  pay per click advertising and related services  call based advertising  feed management  and local campaign management 
our primary sources of revenue are the performance based advertising services  which include pay per click services  pay for call services  cost per action services and feed management services 
these primary sources amounted to greater than of our revenues in all periods presented 
our secondary sources of revenue are our campaign management services  natural search optimization services and outsourced search marketing platforms 
these secondary sources amounted to less than of our revenues in all periods presented 
we have no barter transactions 
we recognize revenue upon the completion of our performance obligation  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in certain cases  we record revenue based on available and reported preliminary information from third parties 
collection on the related receivables may vary from reported information based upon third party refinement of the estimated and reported amounts owing that occurs subsequent to period ends 
performance based advertising services in providing pay per click and pay for call advertising services  we generate revenue upon our delivery of qualified and reported click throughs or phone calls to our advertisers or advertising service providers listings 
these advertisers and advertising service providers pay us a designated transaction fee for each click through or phone call  which occurs when an online user clicks on or makes a phone call based on any of their advertisement listings after it has been placed by us or by our distribution partners 
each click through on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction 
the advertisement listings are displayed within our distribution network  which includes search engines  directories  destination sites  third party internet domains or web sites  our portfolio of owned web sites and other targeted web based content 
we also generate revenue from cost per action services  which occurs when the online user is redirected from one of our web sites or a third party web site in our distribution network to an advertiser web site and completes the specified action  such as when a call is placed 
in providing pay per click contextual targeting services  advertisers purchase keywords or keyword strings  based on an amount they choose for a targeted placement on vertically focused web sites or specific pages of a web site that are specific to their products or services and their marketing objectives 
the contextual results distributed by our services are prioritized for users by the amount the advertiser is willing to pay each time a user clicks on the merchant s advertisement and the relevance of the merchant s advertisement  which is dictated by historical click through rates 
advertisers pay us when a click through occurs on their advertisement 
in providing feed management services  advertisers pay for their web pages and product databases to be crawled  or searched  and included in search engine  directory and product shopping engine results within our distribution network 
generally  the feed management listings are presented in a different section of the web page than the pay per click listings 
for this service  revenue is generated when an online user clicks on a feed management listing from search engine  directory or product shopping engine results 
each click through on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction for which the advertiser pays for on a per click basis 
the placement of a feed management result is largely determined by its relevancy  as determined by the distribution partner 
search marketing services advertisers pay us additional fees for services such as campaign management and natural search engine optimization 
advertisers generally pay us on a click through basis  although in certain cases we receive a fixed fee for delivery of these services 
in some cases we also deliver banner campaigns for select advertisers 
we may also charge initial set up  account  service or inclusion fees as part of our services 
banner advertising revenue may be based on a fixed fee per click and is generated and recognized on click through activity 
in other cases  banner payment terms are volume based with revenue generated and recognized when impressions are delivered 
non refundable account set up fees are paid by advertisers and are recognized ratably over the longer of the term of the contract or the average expected advertiser relationship period  which generally ranges from twelve months to more than two years 
other account and service fees are recognized in the month or period the account fee or services relate to 
other inclusion fees are generally associated with monthly or annual subscription based services where a advertiser pays a fixed amount to be included in our index of listings or our distribution partners index of listings 
revenues from these subscription arrangements are recognized ratably over the service period 
outsourced search marketing platforms we generate revenue from enterprise partners and publishers utilizing our web based technologies 
we are paid a management or agency fee based on the total amount of the purchase made by the advertiser 
the partners or publishers engage the advertisers and are the primary obligor  and we  in certain instances  are only financially liable to the publishers in our capacity as a collection agency for the amount collected from the advertisers 
we recognize revenue for these fees under the net revenue recognition method 
industry and market factors we enter into agreements with various distribution partners to provide distribution for the url strings and advertisement listings of our advertisers 
we generally pay distribution partners based on a percentage of revenue or a fixed amount per click through on these listings 
the level of click throughs contributed by our distribution partners has varied  and we expect it will continue to vary  from quarter to quarter and year to year  sometimes significantly 
if we do not add new distribution partners  renew our current distribution partner agreements or replace traffic lost from terminated distribution agreements with other sources or if our distribution partners search businesses do not grow or are adversely affected  our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to grow will be impacted by our ability to increase our distribution  which impacts the number of internet users who have access to our advertisers listings and the rate at which our advertisers are able to convert clicks from these internet users into completed transactions  such as a purchase or sign up 
our ability to grow also depends on our ability to continue to increase the number of advertisers who use our services and the amount these advertisers spend on our services 
we anticipate that these variables will fluctuate in the future  affecting our ability to grow and our financial results 
in particular  it is difficult to project the number of click throughs we will deliver to our advertisers and how much advertisers will spend with us  and it is even more difficult to anticipate the average revenue per click through 
it is also difficult to anticipate the impact of worldwide economic conditions on advertising budgets  including due to the economic uncertainty resulting from recent disruptions in global financial markets 
in addition  we believe we will experience seasonality 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to seasonal fluctuations in levels of internet usage and seasonal purchasing cycles of many advertisers 
it is generally understood that during the spring and summer months  internet usage is lower than during other times of the year  especially in comparison to the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
the extent to which usage may decrease during these off peak periods is difficult to predict 
prolonged or severe decreases in usage during these periods may adversely affect our growth rate and results 
additionally  the current deterioration in the economic conditions has generally resulted in advertisers and enterprise partners reducing advertising and marketing services budgets  which we expect will impact our quarterly results of operations in addition to the typically seasonality seen in our industry 
service costs our service costs represent the cost of providing our performance based advertising services and our search marketing services 
the service costs that we have incurred in the periods presented primarily include user acquisition costs  amortization of intangible assets  license and content fees  credit card processing fees  network operations  serving our search results  telecommunication costs  including provisioning of telephone numbers  maintaining our web sites  domain name registration renewal fees  network fees  fees paid to outside service providers  delivering customer service  depreciation of our web sites  network equipment and internally developed software  colocation service charges of our web site equipment  bandwidth and software license fees  payroll and related expenses of related personnel  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
user acquisition costs for the periods presented the largest component of our service costs consist of user acquisition costs that relate primarily to payments made to distribution partners for access to their online user traffic 
we enter into agreements of varying durations with distribution partners that integrate our services into their web sites and indexes 
the primary economic structure of the distribution partner agreements is a variable payment based on a specified percentage of revenue 
these variable payments are often subject to minimum payment amounts per click through 
other payment structures that to a lesser degree exist include fixed payments  based on a guaranteed minimum amount of usage delivered  variable payments based on a specified metric  such as number of paid click throughs  and a combination arrangement with both fixed and variable amounts that may be paid in advance 
we expense user acquisition costs based on whether the agreement provides for fixed or variable payments 
agreements with fixed payments with minimum guaranteed amounts of usage are expensed as the greater of the pro rata amount over the term of arrangement or the actual usage delivered to date based on the contractual revenue share 
agreements with variable payments based on a percentage of revenue  number of paid click throughs or other metrics are expensed as incurred based on the volume of the underlying activity or revenue multiplied by the agreed upon price or rate 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales functions  advertising and promotional expenditures including online and outside marketing activities  cost of systems used to sell to and serve advertisers  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
product development product development costs consist primarily of expenses incurred in the research and development  creation and enhancement of our web sites and services 
our research and development expenses include payroll and related expenses for personnel  costs of computer hardware and software  costs incurred in developing features and functionality of the services we offer  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
for the periods presented  substantially all of our product development expenses are research and development 
product development costs are expensed as incurred or capitalized into property and equipment in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement requires that costs incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of an internal use software project be expensed as incurred and that certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a project be capitalized 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel  professional services  including accounting  legal and insurance  bad debt provisions  facilities costs  other general corporate expenses  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
stock based compensation we follow financial accounting standards board s fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment sfas r and account for stock based compensation under the fair value method 
as a result  stock based compensation consists of the following all share based compensation arrangements granted after january  adoption date of sfas r and for any such arrangements that are modified  cancelled  or repurchased after that date  and the portion of previous share based awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of january  stock based compensation expense has been included in the same lines as compensation paid to the same employees in the consolidated statement of operations in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
amortization of intangibles from acquisitions amortization of intangible assets excluding goodwill relates to intangible assets identified in connection with our acquisitions 
the intangible assets have been identified as non competition agreements  trade and internet domain names  distributor relationships  advertising relationships  patents  and acquired technology 
these assets are amortized over useful lives ranging from to months 
provision for income taxes for income tax purposes  we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
each reporting period we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that realization is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not  based on operating performance and projections of future taxable income  that our net deferred tax assets  excluding certain state net operating loss carryforwards  will be realized 
in determining that it was more likely than not that we would realize the deferred tax assets  factors considered included historical taxable income  historical trends related to advertiser usage rates  projected revenues and expenses  macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our other assets 
additionally  the majority of our deferred tax assets are from goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with various acquisitions that are tax deductible over year periods 
based on projections of future taxable income the company expects to be able to recover these assets 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if our projections of future taxable income are reduced or if we do not perform at the levels we are projecting 
this could result in increases to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase to income tax expense of up to the entire net amount of deferred tax assets 
from time to time  various state  federal  and other jurisdictional tax authorities undertake reviews of us and our filings 
we believe any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these reviews will not be material to the financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fin no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this pronouncement prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the our tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin was effective for us beginning january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
as of december   we have gross deferred tax assets of million  relating to the impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangibles assets  net operating loss carryforwards and certain other temporary differences 
as of december   based upon both positive and negative evidence available  we have determined it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards in state and foreign jurisdictions will be realizable and accordingly  have recorded a valuation allowance of million against these deferred tax assets 
should we determine in the future that we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets  or not be able to realize all or part of our remaining net deferred tax assets recorded as of december   an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would impact net income or stockholders equity in the period such determination was made 
as of december  and  we had federal net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of million for both periods which will begin to expire in the tax reform act of limits the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
we believe that such a change has occurred  and that the utilization of the approximately million of nol carryforwards is limited such that substantially all of these federal nol carryforwards will never be utilized 
as of december  and  we had certain tax effected state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not have a history of taxable income in the relevant state and the state net operating loss carryforwards will more likely than not expire unutilized 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance on the state net operating loss carryforwards as of december  and convertible preferred stock during and  the company s board of directors declared the following quarterly dividends on the company s convertible exchangeable preferred stock approval date per share dividend date of record total amount in thousands payment date january february  february  april may  may  july august  august  october november  november  january february  february  april may  may  july august  august  in  we repurchased  shares of preferred stock for a total cash expenditure of approximately  in  we repurchased the remaining outstanding  shares of preferred stock for a total cash expenditure of approximately million 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  and comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  
revenue 
the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source  for the periods presented years ended december  proprietary traffic sources partner and other revenue sources total revenue our proprietary traffic revenues are generated from our portfolio of owned web sites which are monetized with pay per click and cost per action listings and graphical ad units that are relevant to the web sites 
when an online user navigates to one of our owned and operated web sites and clicks on a particular listing or completes the specified action  we receive a fee 
our partner network revenues are primarily generated using third party distribution networks to deliver the advertisers listings 
the distribution network includes search engines  shopping engines  directories  destination sites  third party internet domains or web sites  and other targeted web based content 
we generate revenue upon delivery of qualified and reported click throughs to our advertisers or to advertising services providers listings 
we pay a revenue share to the distribution partners to access their online user traffic 
other revenues include our call provisioning and call tracking services  campaign management services  natural search optimization services and outsourced search marketing platforms 
revenue increased  from million in to million in the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to proprietary traffic sources  including our portfolio of more than  web sites 
the majority of the revenues from our proprietary traffic sources are attributable to the name development  pike street and areaconnect portfolios of web sites 
substantially all of the proprietary traffic revenue increase was attributable to an increase in the average revenue per advertiser 
revenues from our arrangement with yahoo whereby we receive payment upon click throughs on pay per click listings presented on our web sites decreased in  in part as we experienced more demand and revenue growth for cost per actions from enterprise partners such as at t  rh donnelley corporation  idearc media corp  yellowbook usa inc  the cobalt group  whitepages  inc  vantage media  llc and intelius  inc  particularly related to our local search and directory web sites 
we believe the increase in proprietary revenues is in part attributable to updates and enhancements for certain of the web sites as well as increased sales  marketing and optimization efforts and expenditures 
the partner network and other revenues were affected by our adding more than  accounts to our local online and call based advertising platforms which were primarily attributable to an increase of million in the revenues we generated from enterprise partners related to our local online advertising platform and call based advertising services 
these revenue increases were offset by a million decrease attributable to less traffic volume from domain name owners who are distribution partners utilizing our third party content platform including a net decline of fifteen distribution partners from domain name owners comparing the year ended december  to the same period in a portion of the decrease was also attributable to lower pay per click revenues due in part to more than  fewer advertisers spending on our partner network 
under our arrangement with at t  we generate revenues from our local online advertising platform to sell search marketing packages and or call advertising packages through their existing sales channels  which are then fulfilled by us across our distribution network 
we are paid accounts fees and also agency fees for our services in the form of a percentage of the cost of every click or call delivered to their advertisers 
at t and yahoo in accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues compared to and  respectively  in as noted above  revenues from idearc and intelius are primarily related to our local search and directory web sites and revenues increased for both from less than in to and in  respectively 
revenue increased  from million in to million in the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase of million in partner and other revenue sources 
we believe the increase in partner revenues is in part attributable to growth of our existing distribution partners  an increase in the number of accounts added on our platform of more than  and related revenues we generated from enterprise partners  more distribution partners adopting our third party content platform which correspondingly increased revenue generated clicks  and our introduction of voice based services which contributed million of revenue primarily resulting from our acquisition of marchex voice services which was not significant to our financial results in the majority of the increase in revenues from our proprietary traffic is attributable to more click throughs on advertiser s listings on our portfolio of more than  web sites 
we also believe the foregoing factors  combined with our sales marketing and optimization efforts have contributed to an increase in the average revenue per advertiser 
we expect revenues to decrease from domain name owners who are distribution partners utilizing our third party content platform as we have reduced the development and sales resources focused on those services 
in the near term  given the current deterioration in economic conditions we expect advertisers and enterprise partners to generally reduce their advertising and marketing services budgets 
certain of our large advertiser and enterprise partners are experiencing financial challenges  including issues stemming from the current deterioration in economic conditions  and we expect our revenues from such advertisers and enterprise partners to trend lower in the near term as these advertisers may spend less  particularly on our proprietary traffic sources 
our ability to maintain and grow our revenues will depend in part on maintaining and increasing the number of click throughs and calls performed by users of our services through our distribution partners and proprietary traffic sources and maintaining and increasing the number and volume of transactions and favorable payment terms with advertisers and advertising service providers  which we believe is dependent in part on marketing our web sites and delivering high quality traffic that ultimately results in purchases or conversions for our advertisers and advertising services providers 
we may increase our direct monetization of our proprietary traffic sources which may not be at the same rate levels as other advertising providers and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
if we do not add new distribution partners  renew our current distribution partner agreements or replace traffic lost from terminated distribution agreements with other sources or if our distribution partners search businesses do not grow or are adversely affected  our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
as revenue grows and the volume of transactions and traffic increases  we will need to expand our network infrastructure 
inefficiencies in our network infrastructure to scale and adapt to higher traffic volumes could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the company anticipates that these variables will fluctuate in the future  affecting our growth rate and our financial results 
in particular  it is difficult to project the number of click throughs we will deliver to our advertisers and how much advertisers will spend with us  and it is even more difficult to anticipate the average revenue per click through 
it is also difficult to anticipate the impact of worldwide economic conditions on advertising budgets  including due to the economic uncertainty resulting from recent disruptions in global financial markets  although in the near term  we believe advertisers may limit their total advertising budgets 
in addition  we believe we will experience seasonality 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to seasonal fluctuations in levels of internet usage and seasonal purchasing cycles of many advertisers 
it is generally understood that during the spring and summer months  internet usage is lower than during other times of the year  especially in comparison to the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
the extent to which usage may decrease during these off peak periods is difficult to predict 
prolonged or severe decreases in usage during these periods may adversely affect our growth rate and results 
additionally  the current deterioration in the economic conditions has resulted in many advertisers and enterprise partners reducing advertising and marketing services budgets  which we expect will impact our quarterly results of operations in addition to the typical seasonality seen in our industry

service costs 
service costs decreased from million in to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in payments to distribution partners  payment processing fees and royalties of million offset by an increase in facility  co location  depreciation and amortization  registration fees and internet domain amortization and other costs of million and an increase in personnel and stock based compensation of million 
service costs increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in payments to distribution partners  facility  co location  depreciation and amortization  personnel and other costs of million  an increase in registration fees and internet domain amortization of million  offset by decreases in stock based compensation  payment processing fees and royalties of million 
this total increase also resulted from the marchex voice services acquisition  a greater number of searches  an increase in database and hardware capacity requirements  an increase in the number of personnel required to support our services and an increase in fees paid to outside service providers 
service costs represented of revenue in compared to in and in the decrease as a percentage of revenue in service costs as compared to was primarily as a result as a larger proportion of revenue from proprietary traffic sources for which there are no related distribution partner payments 
the increase as percentage of revenue in service costs as compared to was primarily a result of a larger proportion of revenue attributable to our partner and other revenue sources for which there are related distribution partner payments and additional investments in infrastructure and personnel costs 
payments to feed management and pay per click distribution partners account for higher user acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue relative to our overall service cost percentage 
we expect that user acquisition costs and revenue shares to distribution partners are likely to increase prospectively given the competitive landscape for distribution partners 
to the extent that payments to feed management and pay per click distribution partners make up a larger percentage of future operations  or the addition or renewal of existing distribution partner agreements are on terms less favorable to us  we expect that service costs will increase as a percentage of revenue 
our proprietary traffic sources have a lower service cost as a percentage of revenue relative to our overall service cost percentage 
to the extent our proprietary traffic sources make up a larger percentage of our future operations  we expect that service costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue 
we also expect that service costs will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of additional stock based compensation expense  costs associated with the expansion of our operations and network infrastructure as we scale and adapt to increases in the volume of transactions and traffic and invest in our platforms 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses were and for and  respectively 
the increase of million was related primarily to an increase in online and outside marketing activities due in part to our rebranding efforts during the year  additional demand for our local search and directory web site traffic and additional personnel costs 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as a result of additional stock based compensation expense and in connection with any revenue increase to the extent that we also increase our marketing activities and correspondingly could increase as a percentage of revenue 
we also expect fluctuations in marketing expenditures as we redirect our online marketing efforts towards more of our recently updated web sites and direct monetization of our proprietary traffic sources but expect expenditures related to these efforts to increase in absolute dollars in the long term 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses was for both and the increase in dollars was related primarily to an increase in online and outside marketing activities and additional personnel from the marchex voice services acquisition  partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation of million

product development expenses increased  from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  product development expenses were and for and  respectively

amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions 
intangible amortization expense decreased  from million in to million in the decrease was related to certain of our intangible assets being fully amortized partially offset by an increase related to the marchex voice services acquisition in during the  the components of amortization of intangibles were service costs of million  sales and marketing of million and general and administrative of  intangible amortization expense decreased  from million in to million in the decrease was related to certain of our intangible assets being fully amortized partially offset by an increase related to the marchex voice services acquisition in during the  the components of amortization of intangibles were service costs of million  sales and marketing of million and general and administrative of million

the identified intangibles amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively  and are being amortized over a range of useful lives of to months 
we may acquire identifiable intangible assets as part of future acquisitions  and if so  we expect that our intangible amortization will increase in absolute dollars 
impairment of goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment testing in accordance with the sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of this testing  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge on goodwill 
the impairment charge resulted in part from adverse equity and credit market conditions that caused a sustained decrease in current market multiples and our stock price  a decrease in valuations of us public companies and corresponding increased costs of capital created by the weakness in the us financial markets and decreases in cash flow forecasts for the markets where we operate 
impairment of intangible assets

with respect to a significant portion of our pay per click advertising services  we have no corresponding payments to distribution partners related to our proprietary revenues or we receive payment from advertisers prior to our delivery of related click throughs with the corresponding payments to the distribution partners who provide placement for the listings generally made only after our delivery of a click through 
in most cases  the amount payable to the distribution partner will be calculated at the end of a calendar month  with a payment period following the delivery of the click throughs 
this payment structure results in a lag period between the earlier receipt of the cash from the advertisers and the later payment to the distribution partners 
these services constituted the majority of revenue in  and in certain cases  payments to distribution partners are paid in advance or are fixed in advance based on a guaranteed minimum amount of usage delivered 
nearly all of the feed management services and advertising services provider arrangements are billed on a monthly basis following the month of our click through delivery 
this payment structure results in our advancement of monies to the distribution partners who have provided the corresponding placements of the listings 
for these services  advertiser s payments are generally received one to three weeks following payment to the distribution partners 
we expect that in the future periods  if the feed management services account for a greater percentage of our operating activity  working capital requirements will increase as a result 
we have payment arrangement with enterprise partners particularly related to our proprietary traffic sources or local online advertising platforms  such as at t  rh donnelley corporation  idearc media corp  yellowbook usa inc  the cobalt group  whitepages  inc  vantage media llc and intelius  inc  whereby we receive payment between and days following the delivery of services 
certain of these partners have recently had debt rating agencies downgrade their debt instruments and have capital structures that are creating liquidity uncertainty and challenges 
we believe certain of these enterprise partners are reviewing approaches to restructuring and streamlining their operations 
for the year and as of december  amounts from these partners along with yahoo totaled of revenue and million in accounts receivable  respectively 
based on the timing of payments  we generally have this level of amounts in outstanding accounts receivable at any given time from these partners 
there can be no assurances that these partners or other advertisers will not experience further financial difficulty  curtail operations  reduce or eliminate spend budgets  delay payments or otherwise forfeit balances owed 
accounts receivable balances outstanding at december  from yahoo  at t  idearc and intelius totaled million  million  million and million  respectively

as our operations increase  we expect property and equipment purchases will increase as we continue to invest in equipment and software for our systems and personnel 
additionally  we have expended amounts for product development initiatives as well as amounts recorded as part of property and equipment for internally developed software 
we expect our expenditures for product development initiatives and internally developed software will increase in absolute dollars as our development activities accelerate and we increase the number of personnel and consultants to enhance our service offerings 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  of approximately million was primarily attributable to the repurchase of million shares of class b common stock for treasury stock and  shares of preferred stock totaling approximately million and million  respectively  and common stock and preferred dividend payments of million  partially offset by net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of stock through employee stock options  employee stock purchases and the issuance of restricted stock to employees and  of excess tax benefit related to stock options

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
total less than year years years contractual obligations operating leases capital leases other contractual obligations total contractual obligations in february we entered into agreements with an advertising partner to which we paid million  in an upfront payment and a contingent royalty based on a discounted rate of under certain circumstances of certain of our gross revenues payable on a quarterly basis through december the upfront license fee has been capitalized and has been amortized ratably over months 
the royalty payment is recognized as incurred in service costs is not included in the above schedule 
during and  we paid approximately million and  respectively  for the purchase of additional internet domains or web sites 
we expect to continue acquiring internet domains or web sites in the normal course of business as we grow our proprietary network of web sites 
we anticipate that we will need to invest working capital towards the development and expansion of our overall operations 
we may also make a significant number of acquisitions  which could result in the reduction of our cash balances or the incurrence of debt 
on april   we entered into a three year credit agreement which provides us with a million senior secured revolving credit line  which may be used for various corporate purposes including financing permitted acquisitions  subject to compliance with applicable covenants 
as of december   we had no borrowings under the credit agreement 
furthermore  we expect that capital expenditures may increase in future periods  particularly if our operating activity increases 
in november  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to million shares of our class b common stock as well as the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend for the holders of the class a common stock and class b common stock 
in february  our board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program to provide for the repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously repurchased under the share repurchase program of our class b common stock 
in august  the company s board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program for the company to repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously repurchased under the share repurchase program of the company s class b common stock 
in december  the company s board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program for the company to repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously repurchased under the share repurchase program of the company s class b common stock 
in february  the company s board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program for the company to repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously repurchased under the share repurchase program of the company s class b common stock 
under the revised share repurchase program  repurchases may take place in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions and at times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements  capital availability  and other market conditions 
this share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 
during the year ended december   approximately million shares of class b common stock were repurchased under the share repurchase program 
during the year ended december   approximately million shares of class b common stock were repurchased under the share repurchase program 
in  we have repurchased approximately million of class b common stock to date 
the quarterly cash dividend was initiated at per share of class a common stock and class b common stock 
quarterly dividends were paid on february   may   august  and november  to class a and class b common stockholders of record as of the close of business on february   may   august  and november   respectively 
total dividends paid in were approximately million 
although we expect that the annual cash dividend  subject to capital availability  will be per common share or approximately million for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at such a rate or at all 
under delaware law  dividends to stockholders may be made only from the surplus of a company  or  in certain situations  from the net profits for the current fiscal year before the dividend is declared by the board of directors 
based on our operating plans we believe that existing resources and cash flow provided by ongoing operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twelve months 
additional equity and debt financing may be needed to support our acquisition strategy  our long term obligations and our company s needs 
if additional financing is necessary  it may not be available  and if it is available  it may not be possible for us to obtain financing on satisfactory terms 
failure to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern and to achieve our intended business objectives 
critical accounting policies the policies below are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies relate to the following matters and are described below revenue  goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  advertiser and incentive program credits  and provision for income taxes 
revenue we currently generate revenue through our operating businesses by delivering performance based and search marketing services to advertisers and advertising service providers 
the primary revenue driver has been performance based advertising  which includes pay per click listings  pay for call  cost per action services and feed management services 
for pay per click listing  pay for calls and feed management services  revenue is recognized upon our delivery of qualified and reported click throughs or phone calls to our advertisers or advertising service providers listing which occurs when an online user clicks on or makes a phone call based on any of their advertisements after it has been placed by us or by our distribution partners 
each click through on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction 
for cost per action services  revenue is recognized when the online user is redirected from one of our web sites or a third party web site in our distribution network to an advertiser web site and completes the specified action  such as when a call is placed 
in certain cases  we record revenue based on available and reported preliminary information from third parties 
collection on the related receivables may vary from reported information based upon third party refinement of the estimated and reported amounts owing that occurs subsequent to period ends 
we have entered into agreements with various distribution partners in order to expand our distribution network  which includes search engines  directories  product shopping engines  certain third party web sites and our portfolio of owned web sites  on which we include our advertisers listings 
we generally pay distribution partners based on a specified percentage of revenue or a fixed amount per click through on these listings 
we act as the primary obligor in these transactions  and we are responsible for providing customer and administrative services to the advertiser 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the revenue derived from advertisers who receive paid introductions through us as supplied by distribution partners is reported gross based upon the amounts received from the advertiser 
we also recognize revenue for certain agency contracts with advertisers under the net revenue recognition method 
under these specific agreements  we purchase listings on behalf of advertisers from search engines and directories 
we are paid an agency fee based on the total amount of the purchase made on behalf of these advertisers 
under these agreements  our advertisers are primarily responsible for choosing the publisher and determining pricing  and the company  in certain instances  is only financially liable to the publisher for the amount collected from our advertisers 
this creates a sequential liability for media purchases made on behalf of advertisers 
in certain instances  the web publishers engage the advertisers directly and we are paid an agency fee based on the total amount of the purchase made by the advertiser 
we apply eitf issue no 
 eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to account for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
addresses certain aspects of accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
when an arrangement involves multiple elements  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
fair value for each element is established based on the sales price charged when the same element is sold separately 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
we apply the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived asset sfas 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
events and circumstances considered in determining whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in the company s stock price and or market capitalization for a sustained period of time 
if our stock price were to trade below book value per share for a extended period of time and or we continue to experience adverse effects of a continued downward trend in the overall economic environment  changes in the business itself  including changes in projected earnings and cash flows  we may have to recognize an impairment of all or some portion of our goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
if the fair value is lower than the carrying value  a material impairment charge may be reported in our financial results 
we exercise judgment in the assessment of the related useful lives of intangible assets  the fair values and the recoverability 
in certain instances  the fair value is determined in part based on cash flow forecasts and discount rate estimates 
we review our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
to the extent such evaluation indicates that the useful lives of intangible assets are different than originally estimated  the amortization period is reduced or extended and  accordingly  amortization expense is increased or decreased 
recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if such asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment is to be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds fair value 
assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
we performed our annual impairment testing in accordance with sfas and in light of the current macroeconomic environment and significant decrease in market capitalization 
we also performed a review on certain of our intangible assets under sfas as a result of this testing  we recorded million pre tax impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the impairment charge resulted in part from adverse equity and credit market conditions that caused a sustained decrease in current market multiples and the company s stock price  a decrease in valuations of us public companies and corresponding increased costs of capital created by the weakness in the us financial markets and decreases in cash flow forecasts for us and the markets in which we operate 
certain technology and domain assets were written down due to the decreased cash flow forecasts and planned utilization of the assets 
the impairment charges will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
for the period from january  to march   the us financial markets and our stock price have been impacted by continued deterioration in economic conditions 
should economic conditions and other indicators further deteriorate or impact our ability to achieve levels of forecasted operating results and cash flows  or should other events occur indicating the remaining carrying value of goodwill might be impaired  we would test our intangible assets for impairment and may recognize an additional impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds such asset s fair value 
any future additional impairment charges or changes to the estimated amortization periods could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
stock based compensation sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation for all stock based awards made to employees and directors including stock options and restricted stock issuances based on estimated fair values 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
under fas r  we use the black scholes option pricing model as our method of valuation for stock based awards 
our determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected life of the award  our expected stock price  volatility over the term of the award and actual and projected exercise behaviors 
although the fair value of stock based awards is determined in accordance with fas r  the assumptions used in calculating fair value of stock based awards and the black scholes option pricing model are highly subjective  and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted  exercised and cancelled 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note c stock option plan in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
allowance for doubtful accounts and advertiser and incentive program credits accounts receivable balances are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts and advertiser credits 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable 
we determine our allowance based on analysis of historical bad debts  advertiser concentrations  advertiser creditworthiness and current economic trends 
we review the allowance for collectibility on a quarterly basis 
account balances are written off against the allowance after all reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and the potential recovery is considered remote 
if the financial condition of our advertisers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimated the allowances required  additional allowances may be required which would result in increased general and administrative expenses in the period such determination was made 
we determine our allowance for advertiser credits and adjustments based upon our analysis of historical credits 
under the advertiser incentive program  we grant advertisers credits depending upon the individual amounts of prepayments made 
the incentive program allowance is determined based on the historical rate of incentives earned and used by advertisers compared to the related revenues recognized by us 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments and estimates 
provision for income taxes for income tax purposes  we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
each reporting period we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that realization is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not  based on operating performance and projections of future taxable income  that our net deferred tax assets  excluding certain state net operating loss carryforwards  will be realized 
in determining that it was more likely than not that we would realize the deferred tax assets  factors considered included historical taxable income  historical trends related to advertiser usage rates  projected revenues and expenses  macroeconomic conditions  issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our other assets 
additionally  the majority of our deferred tax assets have arisen due to deductions taken in our financial statements related to the impairment of goodwill and amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with various acquisitions that are tax deductible over year periods 
based on projections of future taxable income the company expects to be able to recover these assets 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if our projections of future taxable income are reduced or if we do not perform at the levels we are projecting 
this could result in increases to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase to income tax expense of up to the entire net amount of deferred tax assets 
from time to time  various state  federal  and other jurisdictional tax authorities undertake reviews of us and our filings 
we believe any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these reviews will not be material to the financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fin no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this pronouncement prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the our tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin was effective for us beginning january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
as of december   we have gross deferred tax assets of million  relating to the impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangible assets  net operating loss carryforwards and certain other temporary differences 
as of december   based upon both positive and negative evidence available  we have determined it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards in state and foreign jurisdictions will be realized and accordingly  have recorded a valuation allowance of million against these deferred tax assets 
should we determine in the future that we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets  or not be able to realize all or part of our remaining net deferred tax assets recorded as of december   an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would impact net income or stockholders equity in the period such determination was made 
as of december  and  we had federal net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of million for both periods which will begin to expire in the tax reform act of limits the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
we believe that such a change has occurred  and that the utilization of the approximately million of nol carryforwards is limited such that substantially all of these federal nol carryforwards will never be utilized 
as of december  and  we had certain tax effected state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not have a history of taxable income in the relevant state and the state net operating loss carryforwards will more likely than not expire unutilized 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance on the state net operating loss carryforwards as of december  and recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements 
sfas is effective for us on january  in february  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp sfas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the fsp defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  accordingly  we adopted the required provisions of sfas on january  and the remaining provisions will be adopted by us at the beginning of fiscal year the fiscal year adoption of the required provisions did not result in a material impact to our financial statements 
the remaining aspects of sfas for which the effective date was deferred under fsp sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any resulting goodwill in the acquiree 
the pronouncement also provides for disclosures to enable uses of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r will be effective for us on january  we do not expect sfas r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp sfas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp sfas  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
fsp sfas also adds additional disclosures to be included in financial statements 
fsp sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
we do not expect fsp sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf  which addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transaction are participating securities prior to vesting and would need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method of sfas no 
 earnings per share 
fsp eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that fsp eitf will have on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term  money market funds 
we place our investments with high quality financial institutions 
during the years ended december  and  the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our investments and our earnings were not material 
further  we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our investments and our earnings from a hypothetical change in interest rates would not be significant 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
our existing credit facility bears interest at a rate which will be  at our option  either i the applicable margin rate depending on our leverage plus the one month libor rate reset daily  or ii the applicable margin rate plus the    or month libor rate 
this facility is exposed to market rate fluctuations and may impact the interest paid on any borrowings under the credit facility 
currently  we have no borrowings under this facility  however  an increase in interest rates would impact interest expense on future borrowings
