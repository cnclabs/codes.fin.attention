item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading national provider of electronic security alarm monitoring services  providing installation  maintenance and electronic monitoring of alarm systems to single family residential  commercial  multifamily and wholesale customers 
we monitor signals from burglary  fire  medical and environmental alarm systems and manage information from access control and cctv systems 
our business consists of three primary segments retail  wholesale and multifamily 
our retail segment provides monitoring and maintenance services for electronic security systems directly to residential and business customers 
we also sell and install electronic security systems for homes and businesses through our retail segment in order to meet their security needs 
our wholesale segment contracts with independent security alarm dealers nationwide to provide alarm system monitoring and support services to their residential and business customers 
we also provide business support services as well as financing assistance for these independent dealers by providing loans secured by alarm contracts and by purchasing alarm contracts 
our multifamily segment provides electronic security system installation and alarm monitoring services to owners and managers of apartments  condominiums and other multifamily dwellings 
we market our services to these customer segments through a limited  but separate internal sales and installation branch networks 
as you read this section  please refer to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and accompanying notes found in item these statements show our operating results for the years ended december   and in this section  we analyze and explain the significant annual changes in the components of operating income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
sources of revenue for both retail and multifamily segments  revenue is primarily generated from providing monitoring services 
monitoring revenue is generated based on contracts that we enter into with our customers 
our retail customer contracts typically have three year initial terms for residential customers and five year initial terms for commercial customers 
our multifamily customer contracts have initial terms that fall within a range of five to ten years and average eight years at inception 
our contracts generally also provide for automatic renewal provisions where permitted 
many of our residential and commercial contracts require us to provide additional services  such as maintenance services  generating incremental revenue for us 
wholesale revenue includes monitoring services as well as business support services with contracts generally on a month to month basis 
installation and other revenue consists primarily of sales of burglar alarms  closed circuit television systems  fire alarms and card access control systems to commercial customers as well as amortization of previously deferred revenue 
costs of revenue  expenses monitoring and related services costs generally relate to the cost of providing monitoring service and include the costs of monitoring  billing  customer service and field operations 
installation and other costs of revenue consist primarily of equipment and labor charges to install alarm systems  closed circuit television systems  fire alarms and card access control systems sold to our customers as well as amortization of previously deferred costs 
selling expenses include employee compensation  benefits and recruiting for our internal salesforce  spending on marketing and selling programs  advertising  customer signage  marketing materials  trade show expense  and amortization of previously deferred selling costs 
general and 
table of contents administrative expenses include lease expenses on office space and office equipment  costs of debt collection efforts  employee compensation and benefits  professional service fees and other miscellaneous expenses 
amortization of intangibles and depreciation includes amortization of customer accounts  dealer relationships and non competition agreements as well as depreciation on property and equipment 
business strategy our overall goal is to improve returns on invested capital while increasing our market share in select segments for retail and wholesale electronic security systems and services in the largest cities and metropolitan areas in the united states 
specific goals include delivering value added customer solutions  such as our e secure web based intrusion control solution  to attract new customers as well as drive rmr growth  utilizing technology improvements and our national infrastructure more effectively to continue service improvements while reducing costs to serve our customer base and maintaining our focus on reducing attrition  investing more resources  both personnel and systems based  to increase our share of the market for integrated electronic security systems and services in targeted mid market commercial segments  focusing residential investment within targeted residential segments to drive brand awareness and customer acquisition through multiple channels  including direct sales  telesales  alliances  and the internet  for interactive electronic security systems and service  and investing in order to offer the most advanced web based wholesale services with national disaster recovery while targeting wholesale customers who value these services along with close geographic proximity 
we plan to achieve these objectives by building upon our core strengths  including our multiple monitoring centers and national branch platform  our brand recognition  our internal salesforce model and our highly skilled and experienced management team and workforce 
significant activities debt refinancing on march   we borrowed million under a new unsecured term loan facility to allow us to redeem all of our senior subordinated notes 
the unsecured term loan bears interest at the prime rate plus per annum and matures in using the proceeds from the unsecured term loan and available cash on hand  we redeemed all of the senior subordinated notes effective march  the unsecured term loan lenders include  among others  entities affiliated with the principal stockholders and arlon group 
affiliates of the principal stockholders collectively owned approximately of our common stock as of december  and one of our former directors is affiliated with arlon group 
merger on april  we acquired iasg  which resulted in the acquisition of sizable retail and wholesale operations 
we have consolidated the financial results of iasg beginning on april  pro forma information  which includes iasg financial results as if the merger had been consummated on january   is included in note  iasg acquisition  to the financial statements 
since the merger  we evaluate our operating and financial performance based on three segments retail  wholesale and multifamily 

table of contents other significant activities net loss we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  the net loss reflects substantial charges incurred by us for amortization of customer accounts and other intangibles  interest incurred on indebtedness  and a loss of million on the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes 
trade name impairment and investment in multifamily segment during the third quarter of  an impairment charge of million was recorded on the network multifamily trade name 
the impairment is due to management s expectation that revenue in the multifamily segment will continue to decline  thereby reducing the fair value of the trade name below its carrying value 
we recorded an additional million trade name impairment charge in our multifamily segment in the fourth quarter of which was caused by higher than expected customer attrition  and resulted in total trade name impairment of million in we have reduced the level of additional investment in our multifamily segment until economic conditions become more favorable  including a scaling of its operations to keep costs in line with revenue 
multifamily remains focused on serving the needs of its existing customer base 
performance metrics recurring monthly revenue we measure all of the recurring monthly revenue we are entitled to receive under contracts with customers in effect at the end of the period 
our computation of rmr may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies  in part because our proportion of retail  wholesale  and multifamily rmr may vary significantly from the mix at other companies 
rmr should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to actual monthly revenue  as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we had approximately million of rmr as of december  and and million of rmr as of december  the increase in rmr from is primarily the result of the merger 
even though our proportions of retail  wholesale and multifamily rmr may differ significantly from other companies mix  and even though contributions from each type of rmr varies  we believe the presentation of rmr is useful to investors because the measure is used by investors and lenders to value companies such as ours with recurring revenue streams 
management monitors rmr  among other things  to evaluate our ongoing performance 
in order to enhance investors understanding of the components of our rmr  we include roll forwards for each segment below 
the table below reconciles 
table of contents our rmr to revenue reflected on our consolidated statements of operations dollar amounts in thousands 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  rmr at december amounts excluded from rmr amortization of deferred revenue other revenue a revenue gaap basis december january november total period revenue a revenue that is not pursuant to monthly contractual billings 
our rmr includes amounts billable to customers with past due balances that we believe are collectible 
we seek to preserve the revenue stream associated with each customer contract  primarily to maximize our return on the investment we made to generate each contract 
as a result  we actively work to collect amounts owed to us and to retain the customers at the same time 
in some instances  we may allow up to six months to collect past due amounts  while evaluating the ongoing customer relationship 
when we categorize accounts as at risk because accounts receivable balances exceed certain guidelines or because notice of intent to cancel or move has been provided by the customer  we include the account in attrition calculations 
after we have made every reasonable effort to collect past due balances  we will disconnect the customer and include the loss in attrition calculations 
our rmr calculation is not considered an alternative to revenue calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and is not a substitute indication of our operating performance under gaap 
we believe  however  that the supplemental presentation of rmr is useful to investors because the measure is used by investors and lenders to value companies such as ours with recurring revenue streams 
the following table provides a roll forward of rmr by segment and in total for the years indicated dollar amounts in thousands 
year ended december  retail whole sale multi family total retail whole sale multi family total retail whole sale multi family total beginning rmr balance rmr additions from direct sales rmr additions from merger rmr additions from account purchases rmr losses a price increases and other ending rmr balance a rmr losses include price decreases

monitoring and related services margin in each of the last three years  monitoring and related service revenue comprised approximately of our total revenue 
the increases in monitoring and related services revenue from to are primarily due to the merger 
the table below identifies the monitoring and related services gross margin and gross margin percent for the presented periods  which is exclusive of amortization and depreciation dollar amounts in thousands 
year ended december  monitoring and related services revenue cost of monitoring and related services revenue exclusive of amortization and depreciation gross margin gross margin percent our total monitoring and related services gross margin percentage decreased from the prior periods primarily due to the growth of our wholesale segment as a result of the merger and from internal additions in and  which were proportionately greater than the growth of our retail segment 
retail gross margin was consistent between  and multifamily gross margin has declined as cost saving initiatives have not kept pace with the decline in revenue 
the wholesale gross margin percentage is typically lower than retail and multifamily gross margin percentages due to the reduced number of services we provide to dealers compared to the number of services we provide to our retail and multifamily customers 
acquisition costs per monitored wholesale site are also significantly lower 
in addition  wholesale costs increased faster than revenue because we improved service levels in the acquired monitoring centers by increasing staffing  revenue growth came from monitored sites with lower than average rmr and higher costs to service  including two way voice verification and line security  and we increased staffing levels in in connection with the integration of our wholesale monitoring centers 

table of contents attrition our customer base reflected a net increase in monitored sites during primarily due to growth in our wholesale operations 
the increase in is primarily the result of the merger  through which a significant amount of retail and wholesale customers were acquired 
net losses of customer accounts materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
attrition has a direct impact on our results of operations since it affects our revenue  amortization expense and cash flow 
we monitor attrition each quarter based on a quarterly annualized and trailing twelve month basis 
this method utilizes each segment s average rmr base for the applicable period in measuring attrition 
therefore  in periods of rmr growth  the computation of rmr attrition may result in a number less than would be expected in periods when rmr remains stable 
in periods of rmr decline  the computation of rmr attrition may result in a number greater than would be expected in periods when rmr remains stable 
we believe the presentation of rmr attrition is useful to investors because the measure is used by investors and lenders to value companies such as ours with recurring revenue streams 
in addition  we believe rmr attrition information is more useful than customer account attrition because it reflects the economic impact of customer losses and price decreases 
in the table below  we define attrition as a ratio  the numerator of which is the gross amount of lost rmr  which includes price decreases  for a given period  net of the adjustments described below  and the denominator of which is the average amount of rmr for a given period 
in some instances  we use estimates to derive attrition data 
in the calculations directly below  we do not reduce the gross rmr lost during a period by rmr added from move in accounts  which are accounts where a new customer moves into a home installed with our security system and vacated by a prior customer  or from mover accounts  which are accounts arising from a customer moving into a new location without a security system installed by us and retaining us to install a new system and provide monitoring services 
as defined above  rmr attrition by business segment is summarized at december   and as expected  the relatively higher retail gross attrition on the acquired iasg retail portfolio compared to the legacy retail portfolio caused retail gross attrition to increase in and we also experienced a slight increase in retail cancellations for financial related reasons 
recurring monthly revenue attrition december  december  december  annualized fourth quarter trailing twelve month annualized fourth quarter trailing twelve month annualized fourth quarter trailing twelve month retail wholesale multifamily in the table below  in order to enhance the comparability of our retail segment attrition results with those of other industry participants  many of which report attrition net of new owner and move in accounts and exclude price decreases  we define the denominator the same as above but define the 
table of contents numerator as the gross amount of lost rmr  excluding price decreases  for a given period reduced by rmr added from new owners and move in accounts 
recurring monthly revenue attrition december  december  december  annualized fourth quarter trailing twelve month annualized fourth quarter trailing twelve month annualized fourth quarter trailing twelve month retail our actual attrition experience shows that the relationship period with any individual customer can vary significantly 
customers discontinue service with us for a variety of reasons  including relocation  service issues and cost 
a portion of the customer base can be expected to discontinue service every year 
any significant change in the pattern of our historical attrition experience would have a material effect on our results of operations 
to a much greater extent than retail  wholesale attrition can be affected by the decisions of its largest dealers 
multifamily experienced elevated attrition arising from an increase in rmr at risk and customers terminating services for financial reasons 
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is used by management and reviewed by the board of directors in evaluating segment performance and determining how to allocate resources across segments for investments in customer acquisition activities  capital expenditures and spending in general 
we believe it is also utilized by the investor community that follows the security monitoring industry 
adjusted ebitda is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare operating results from period to period in a meaningful and consistent manner in addition to standard gaap financial measures 
specifically  adjusted ebitda allows management to evaluate segment results of operations  including operating performance of monitoring and service activities  effects of investments in creating new customer relationships  and sales and installation of security systems  without the effects of non cash amortization and depreciation 
adjusted ebitda by segment for the years ended december   and was as follows dollars amounts in thousands for the year ended december  retail wholesale multifamily retail adjusted ebitda increased million in compared to due to additional contribution from customers acquired in the merger 
wholesale adjusted ebitda decreased million in compared to primarily because we improved service levels in the acquired monitoring centers by increasing staffing  revenue growth came from monitored sites with lower than average rmr and higher costs to service including two way voice verification and line security  and we increased staffing levels in in connection with the integration of our wholesale monitoring centers 
multifamily adjusted ebitda decreased million in compared to the decrease is attributable to the decline in its monitored site base and related monitoring and service revenue without a corresponding decrease in related expenses

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  customer accounts  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in the opinion of management of the company  all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements have been included herein 
revenue and expense recognition revenue is recognized when security services are provided 
system installation revenue  sales revenue on equipment upgrades and direct and incremental costs of installations and sales are deferred for residential customers with monitoring service contracts 
for commercial customers and our national account customers  revenue recognition is dependent upon each specific customer contract 
in instances when we pass title to a system  we recognize the associated revenue and costs related to the sale of the equipment in the period that title passes regardless of whether the sale is accompanied by a service agreement 
in cases where we retain title to the system  we defer and amortize revenue and direct costs 
deferred system and upgrade installation revenue are recognized over the estimated life of the customer utilizing an accelerated method for our retail customers 
we amortize deferred revenue from customer acquisitions related to our retail customers over a fifteen year period on an accelerated basis 
the associated deferred customer acquisition costs are amortized  annually and in total  over a fifteen year period on an accelerated basis in amounts that are equal to the amount of revenue amortized  annually and in total  over the fifteen year period 
the deferred customer acquisition costs in excess of the deferred customer acquisition revenue are amortized over the initial term of the contract 
we amortize deferred customer acquisition costs and revenue related to our retail customers using an accelerated basis because we believe this method best approximates the results that would be obtained if we accounted for these deferred costs and revenue on a specific contract basis utilizing a straight line amortization method with write off upon customer termination 
we do not track deferred customer acquisition costs and revenue on a contract by contract basis in our retail segment  and as a result  we are not able to write off the remaining balance of a specific contract when the customer relationship terminates 
deferred customer acquisition costs and revenue are accounted for using pools  with separate pools based on the month and year of acquisition 
we periodically perform a lifing study with the assistance of a third party appraisal firm to estimate the average expected life and attrition pattern of our customers 
the lifing study is based on historical customer terminations 
the results of our lifing studies indicate that our customer pools can expect a declining revenue stream 
we evaluate the differing rates of declining revenue streams for each customer pool and select an amortization rate that closely matches the respective decline curves 
such analysis is used to establish the amortization rates of our customer account pools in order to reflect the pattern of future benefit 

table of contents given that the amortization lives and methods are developed using historical attrition patterns and consider actual customer termination experience  we believe such amortization lives and methods approximate the results of amortizing on a specific contract basis with write off upon termination 
for our multifamily segment  we track the deferred revenues on a contract by contract basis which are recognized over the estimated life of the customer utilizing a straight line method 
the deferred customer acquisition costs in excess of the deferred customer acquisition revenues are amortized over the initial term of the contract 
we write off the unamortized portion of the multifamily deferred customer acquisition revenues and costs when the customer relationship terminates 
the table below reflects the impact of our accounting policy on the respective line items of the statement of operations for the years ended december   and the total amount incurred line represents the current amount of billings that were made and the current costs that were incurred for the period 
we then subtract the deferral amount and add back the amortization of previous deferral amounts to determine the amount we report on the statement of operations dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  revenue other cost of revenue other selling expense revenue other cost of revenue other selling expense revenue other cost of revenue other selling expense retail segment total amount incurred amount deferred amount amortized amount included in statement of operations wholesale segment total amount incurred a multifamily segment total amount incurred amount deferred amount amortized amount included in statement of operations total company total amount incurred amount deferred amount amortized amount reported in statement of operations a the wholesale segment revenue other represents interest and fee income generated from our dealer loan program acquired in the merger 
in addition to the amounts reflected in the table above relating to our costs incurred to create new accounts  our retail segment also capitalized purchases of rental equipment in the amount of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we purchased customer accounts valued at million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we acquired million in customer accounts in in connection with the merger 
we did not purchase customer accounts in the increase in retail costs incurred during relates to an increase in the sale of commercial lease products  which have higher upfront costs  as well as an increase in fuel costs 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill is recorded in the retail  wholesale and multifamily operating segments  which are also our reporting units for purposes of evaluating our recorded goodwill for impairment 
goodwill was million as of december  and goodwill originated with the adoption of push down accounting and the related adjustments during  which was associated with the acquisition of the company by a new controlling shareholder group 
additional goodwill was recorded in connection with the merger during we determined the fair value of each reporting unit acquired in the merger and then allocated goodwill to each reporting unit based on the amount of excess fair value determined after assigning values to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to each reporting unit 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of the beginning of the third quarter and any time an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and we must complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including internally developed intangible assets with a zero carrying value  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 
fair value of the reporting units is determined using a combined income and market approach 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated cash flows discounted using a weighted average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions 
the market approach may involve use of the guideline transaction method  the guideline company method  or both 
the guideline transaction method makes use of available transaction price data of companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business as the respective reporting unit 
the guideline company method uses market multiples of publicly traded companies with operating characteristics similar to the respective reporting unit 
we consider value indications from both the income approach and market approach in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit 
the income approach was given significant weight for all three reporting units because management considers this method a reasonable indicator of fair value 
the market transaction method was also given significant weight for all three reporting units because transactions in the industry are commonly valued as a multiple of rmr 
based on management s experience along with a review of recent industry transactions  management concluded the weighting of the market transaction method was appropriate 
the market guideline company method was given a small weight for retail because  although the guideline companies are generally comparable  they are not similar enough to warrant a significant weight in estimating fair value 
the market guideline company method was given no weight for the wholesale and multifamily reporting units because management determined that there were no sufficiently comparable companies or there was a lack of market data for businesses engaged in these specialized monitored security operations 

table of contents the weighting for each of the methods used in connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing for is detailed in the table below income approach market guideline market transaction retail wholesale multifamily management judgment is a significant factor in determining whether an indicator of impairment has occurred 
management relies on estimates in determining the fair value of each reporting unit  which include the following critical quantitative factors anticipated future cash flows and terminal value for each reporting unit 
the income approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows  including an estimate of terminal value 
the projections use management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in revenue  customer attrition and estimates of expected changes in operating margins 
our projections of future cash flows are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated 
because management frequently updates its projections  we would expect to identify on a timely basis any significant differences between actual results and recent estimates 
we are not expecting actual results to vary significantly from estimates 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is affected by changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants in the security monitoring industry 
the discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants  and for that reason  the capital structure of selected marketplace participants was used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis 
given the current volatile economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term 
identification of comparable transactions within the industry 
the market approach relies on a calculation that uses a multiple of rmr based on actual transactions involving industry participants 
rmr multiples are a commonly used valuation metric in the security monitoring industry 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying rmr multiples to the reporting unit s rmr balance as of the testing date 
although rmr multiples are subject to change  there has not been a noticeable deterioration in transaction values compared to prior years 
we completed our annual impairment testing during the third quarter of and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
we also performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value determined using the income and market approach 
a key assumption for the income approach is the discount rate 
we selected a weighted average cost of capital of percent for all reporting units 
we noted that an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of approximately basis points for the retail reporting unit  basis points for the wholesale reporting unit and basis points for the multifamily reporting unit would result in an estimate of fair value using the income approach of less than the carrying value 
a key assumption for the market approach involves selection of a multiple of rmr 
if the market transaction multiple had not increased in  the concluded fair value of the retail  wholesale and multifamily reporting units as of july  would have still been in excess of the respective carrying values 
given the decline in our market capitalization and uncertainty surrounding the us economy at the end of the fourth quarter of  we concluded a triggering event had occurred indicating potential impairment 
we completed an interim goodwill impairment test as of december  and 
table of contents determined that goodwill was not impaired 
the wholesale reporting unit  however  had limited excess of fair value over carrying value at december  we noted that an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of approximately basis points for the wholesale reporting unit would have resulted in an estimate of fair value less than the carrying value 
we intend to continually monitor for potential triggering events 
our principal indefinite lived intangible assets are trade names 
trade name values were based on the identifiable revenue associated with each segment 
fair value is determined based on the income approach using the relief from royalty method  which requires assumptions related to projected revenues and assumptions regarding the royalty rate and discount rate 
trade name values were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  an impairment charge of million was recorded on the network multifamily trade name 
the impairment was due to management s expectation that revenue in the multifamily segment will continue to decline  thereby reducing the fair value of the trade name below its carrying value 
we have decided to reduce investment in our multifamily segment until economic conditions become more favorable 
we recorded an additional million trade name impairment charge for our multifamily segment in the fourth quarter of  which was caused by higher than expected customer attrition  and resulted in total trade name impairment of million in long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  customer accounts  dealer relationships  deferred customer acquisition costs and other amortizable intangible assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with the guidance in sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying value to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if we determine an impairment exists  the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
projections of future cash flows are subject to change as a result of actual results differing from expectation as well as higher than expected levels of customer attrition 
though we are not expecting actual results to vary significantly from our projections  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
customer account and dealer relationship amortization the choice of an amortization life and method is based on our estimates and judgments about the amounts and timing of expected future revenue from customer accounts and average customer account life 
amortization methods and amortization periods were determined because  in our opinion  they would adequately match amortization cost with anticipated revenue 
we evaluate the appropriateness of the amortization life and method of each of our customer account pools based on the actual historical attrition experience of each pool and  when deemed necessary  perform a lifing study on our customer accounts to assist us in determining appropriate lives of our customer accounts 
these analyses are needed in light of the inherent declining revenue curve over the life of a pool of customer accounts 
we have identified two distinct pools of customer accounts in our retail segment and one customer pool in each of our wholesale and multifamily segments  as shown in the table below  each of which has distinct attributes that affect differing attrition characteristics 
the result of lifing studies indicated to us that we can expect attrition to be greatest in the initial years of asset life and that a declining balance accelerated method therefore best matches the future amortization cost with the estimated revenue stream from these customer pools 
we switch from the declining balance method to the straight line method in the year the straight line method results in greater amortization expense 
our amortization rates consider the average estimated remaining and historical projected attrition rates 
we 
table of contents completed a lifing study during the fourth quarter of  the results of which are discussed in the following paragraphs 
effective as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of  we changed the estimated useful life used to account for retail customer accounts from an accelerated method with a useful life of ten years to a more accelerated method with a useful life of fifteen years 
the change in estimated useful life for our retail customer accounts results from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors  including actual historical customer attrition data  demand and competition 
in accordance with sfas  accounting changes and error correction sfas  the change in estimated useful life is accounted for prospectively 
the change is based on information obtained by continued observation of the pattern of expected benefits derived from these assets 
the effects of the change in estimated useful life described above decreased net revenue by million  decreased installation cost of revenue by million  decreased depreciation and amortization expense by million and net loss by million for the three and twelve month periods ended december  basic and diluted loss per share was decreased by for the three and twelve month periods ended december  as a result of the change 
effective as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of  we also changed the method and estimated useful life used to account for multifamily customer accounts from the straight line method with a useful life of nine years to an accelerated method with a useful life of fifteen years 
the change in method and estimated useful life for our multifamily customer accounts results from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors  including actual historical customer attrition data  demand and competition 
in accordance with sfas  the change in method and estimated useful life represents a change in accounting estimates effected by a change in accounting principle and is accounted for prospectively 
the change is based on information obtained by continued observation of the pattern of expected benefits derived from these assets and is preferable  as it results in amortization that is more reflective of the pattern of expected benefits to be derived from these assets 
the effects of the change in method and estimated useful life described above decreased depreciation and amortization expense by million and net loss by million for the three and twelve month periods ended december  basic and diluted loss per share was decreased by for the three and twelve month periods ended december  as a result of the change 
effective as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of  we also changed the estimated useful life used to account for wholesale dealer relationships from an accelerated method with a useful life of fifteen years to a more accelerated method with a useful life of twenty years 
the change in estimated useful life for our wholesale dealer relationships results from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors  including actual historical dealer attrition data  demand and competition 
in accordance with sfas  the change in estimated useful life is accounted for prospectively 
the change is based on information obtained by continued observation of the pattern of expected benefits derived from these assets 
the effects of the change described above decreased depreciation and amortization expense by million and net loss by million for the three and twelve month periods ended december  basic and diluted loss per share was decreased by for the three and twelve month periods ended december  as a result of the change 

table of contents our amortization rates consider the average estimated remaining and historical projected attrition rates 
the amortization method for each customer pool is as follows pool method prior to october  customer accounts retail protection one ten year declining balance retail iasg nine year declining balance multifamily nine year straight line dealer relationships wholesale fifteen year declining balance october  and after customer accounts retail protection one fifteen year double declining balance retail iasg nine year declining balance multifamily fifteen year declining balance dealer relationships wholesale twenty year declining balance we conduct comprehensive reviews of our attrition experience on an ongoing basis and adjust the estimated lives of our customer accounts and dealer relationships as needed 
we recorded approximately million of customer account amortization and million of dealer relationship amortization for the year ended december  we recorded approximately million of customer account amortization and million of dealer relationship amortization for the year ended december  we recorded approximately million of customer account amortization and million of dealer relationship amortization for the year ended december  the amounts would change if there were changes in the estimated life or amortization rate for customer accounts or dealer relationships 
for example  if we had recorded amortization under the new amortization method for all of  customer account and dealer relationship amortization expense would have been million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  additionally  if we had applied the new amortization method and further reduced the amortization period of each customer pool by one year  customer account and dealer relationship amortization expense would have been approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  acquisitions we account for our acquisitions of security monitoring businesses using the purchase method 
the purchase method requires that we estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired 
the estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and consideration given involves a number of judgments and estimates income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we believe that recovery of most of our deferred tax assets is not 
table of contents likely 
accordingly  a valuation allowance for virtually all of our deferred tax assets has been established 
we currently do not expect to be in a position to record tax benefits for losses incurred in the future

liquidity and capital resources credit risk and liquidity in response to the recent economic conditions  we have assessed the liquidity of our investments 
our cash and cash equivalents are deposited in a mutual fund invested exclusively in us treasury securities 
although the mutual fund is permitted seven days to satisfy withdrawal requests  the financial institution has never exercised the provision 
we believe  based on information available to management at this time  that there is minimal risk regarding liquidity of our approximately million cash and cash equivalents as of december  we have also assessed our credit exposure to various other factors including our ability to draw funds under our revolving credit facility  counterparty default risk associated with our interest rate cap and swaps  our need to enter the capital markets  and  exposure related to our existing insurance policies 
lehman commercial paper  inc lehman is a party to our revolving credit facility with a commitment to fund of our borrowings under the facility 
although we have not and currently do not expect to draw on our revolving credit facility  we expect that lehman will not fund any future borrowing requests 
we have no reason to believe at this time that the other lenders to our revolving credit facility will not fulfill their respective contractual obligations to fund any of our future borrowing requests 
as a result  we believe the availability under our revolving credit facility has been effectively reduced by million 
in spite of the reduced availability  we believe we have sufficient liquidity for our currently foreseeable operational needs 
we have also assessed counterparty credit risk with our interest rate swaps and cap and believe that counterparty default is not probable 
we believe there should be sufficient time for the capital markets to stabilize before we have a need 
table of contents for additional financing 
lastly  we have assessed exposure on our existing insurance policies 
while we do hold certain policies with aig s state regulated insurance companies  we believe they are financially solvent and well capitalized 
supply chain risk was also considered relative to the recent economic conditions 
two vendors are the principal providers of our security related products and services for our retail and multifamily segments 
we believe we can obtain alternative supply in the event such products and services are not available from our existing retail supplier 
we also believe we have sufficient product on hand for our multifamily segment to continue to provide ongoing services in the short term in the event we are unable to obtain products from our primary supplier to this segment 
in april  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate at a one month libor rate of on million and million of our floating rate debt under the senior credit facility through september and october  respectively

debt obligations we expect to generate cash flow in excess of that required for operations  interest payments and principal payments required under all of our debt obligations during the twelve months following the date of the financial statements included in this report 
on march   we borrowed approximately million under a new unsecured term loan facility to allow us to redeem all of the senior subordinated notes 
the unsecured term loan bears interest at the prime rate plus per annum and matures in on april   the company entered into an amended and restated senior credit agreement senior credit agreement increasing the outstanding term loan borrowings by approximately million to million 
depending on the company s leverage ratio at the time of borrowing  the applicable margin with respect to a revolving loan may range from to for a base rate borrowing and to for a eurodollar borrowing 
the senior credit facility continues to include a million revolving credit facility  of which approximately million remains available as of march  after reducing total availability by approximately million for an outstanding letter of credit and million held by lehman

we have the option to redeem the senior secured notes  in whole or in part  upon not less than nor more than days prior notice  at the redemption prices expressed as percentages of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the applicable redemption date  if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on november of the years indicated below subject to the right of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date year percentage upon the occurrence of certain change of control events  each holder of senior secured notes will have the right to require poami to repurchase all or any part of that holder s senior secured notes for a cash payment equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest  if any  to the date of purchase  subject to certain restrictions in the senior credit agreement 
the unsecured term loan agreement  the senior secured notes indenture and the senior credit agreement contain certain covenants and restrictions  including with respect to our ability to incur debt and pay dividends  based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
while the definition of ebitda varies slightly among the unsecured term loan agreement  the senior secured notes indenture and the senior credit agreement  ebitda is generally derived by adding to income loss before income taxes  the sum of interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense  including amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs less amortization of deferred customer acquisition revenue

the consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated interest coverage ratio contained in our senior credit agreement are maintenance tests and the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratios contained in our senior secured notes indenture and unsecured term loan agreement are debt incurrence tests 
we cannot be deemed to be in default solely due to failure to meet such debt incurrence tests 
however  failure to meet such debt incurrence tests could result in restriction on our ability to incur additional ratio indebtedness 
we believe that should we fail to meet the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratios in our senior secured notes indenture and unsecured term loan agreement  our ability to borrow additional funds under other permitted indebtedness provisions in our senior secured notes indenture  unsecured term loan agreement and senior credit agreement would provide us with sufficient liquidity for our currently foreseeable operational needs
