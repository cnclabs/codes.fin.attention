item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion is intended to provide insight into the financial condition and results of operations of united and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since mid  and particularly during the second half of  the financial markets and economic conditions generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity 
this was initially triggered by declines in home prices and the values of subprime mortgages  but spread to all residential construction  particularly in metro atlanta  and residential mortgages as property prices declined rapidly and to nearly all asset classes 
the effect of the market and economic downturn also spread to other areas of the credit markets and in the availability of liquidity 
the magnitude of these declines led to a crisis of confidence in the financial sector as a result of concerns about the capital base and viability of certain financial institutions 
during this period  interbank lending and commercial paper borrowing fell sharply  precipitating a credit freeze for both institutional and individual borrowers 
unemployment has also increased significantly 
by the third quarter of conditions had deteriorated to the point of failure or near failure of several large financial institutions and the failure of fannie mae and freddie mac  two government sponsored enterprises or gses 
these events created serious concerns about the safety and soundness of the entire financial services industry 
the recently enacted emergency economic stabilization act of was signed into law in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system  financial markets and economic conditions generally 
pursuant to eesa  treasury has the authority under the troubled asset relief program to purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
treasury announced the capital purchase program under tarp pursuant to which it has purchased and will continue to purchase senior preferred stock in participating financial institutions 
the eesa followed  and has been followed by  numerous actions by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the us congress  treasury  the federal deposit insurance corporation  the sec and others to address the current crisis  including most recently the american recovery and reinvestment act of united s markets have been severely disrupted by the weak housing market which resulted in the buildup of surplus housing and finished lot inventory  particularly within the atlanta msa  which has put considerable stress on the residential construction portion of united s loan portfolio 
as a result  united reported its first ever net loss of million in  compared to net income of million in the loss per common share was for  compared with diluted earnings per share of for the decrease in earnings from reflected higher credit losses and net interest margin compression caused by the effect of declining interest rates on united s asset sensitive balance sheet along with increased competition for customer deposits  our efforts to strengthen liquidity  and the cost to carry a higher level of non performing assets 
united s approach to managing through the challenging economic cycle has been to aggressively deal with its credit problems and dispose of troubled assets quickly  taking losses as necessary 
as a result  united s provision for loan losses was million in compared with million in net charge offs for were million in compared with million in at the end of  united s allowance for loan losses of million was of loans compared with million or of loans at the end of and total non performing assets were million compared with million at the end of taxable equivalent net interest revenue was million for  down million from most of the decrease in net interest revenue was the result of the basis point decrease in the net interest margin described above which decreased from in to in united also has taken action to ensure sufficient liquidity 
a significant portion of the margin compression resulted from management s efforts to strengthen liquidity in response to supply shortages in interbank borrowings and aggressive demand for customer deposits 
united built liquidity through a second quarter cd promotion and by gathering brokered deposits and paying down overnight borrowings in the second half of adding time deposits produced a stable source of funds and made investment securities collateral available to secure wholesale borrowings as a source of contingent liquidity 
early in the fourth quarter  the us government s efforts to stabilize the financial services industry began to take effect  eliminating much of the liquidity concern as funds became increasingly available through interbank borrowings 
the weak economic conditions of were reflected in other components of united s earnings 
total fee revenue of million was down million from mortgage fees declined with lower demand for housing 
consulting fees were down as banks  searching for ways to control expenses  postponed or deferred consulting engagements 
poor conditions in the financial markets also led to a drop in brokerage fees 
united responded to the drop in revenue by controlling expenses 
although operating expenses of million were up million from  higher foreclosed property expense and fdic insurance expense accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase 
the composition of united s balance sheet at december  reflects the changing economic conditions 
at the end of  united held million in commercial paper as short term investments as part of its emphasis on building liquidity 
loans at december  were billion  down million from the end of  due to united s efforts to reduce exposure to residential construction loans 
at billion  residential construction loans at december  represented of outstanding loans  down from at the end of  a decrease of million 
deposits were up million to billion due to efforts to build liquidity 
at the end of the year  total equity capital was million  up million from december  reflecting the sale of million in senior preferred securities to the us treasury under its capital purchase program 
the additional capital leaves all of united s regulatory capital ratios significantly above well capitalized levels 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates or judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon future events 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record the valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies for united are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management views critical accounting policies to be those that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions  and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements 
management considers the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses  intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on non impaired loans based on historical loss experience  management s evaluation of the current loan portfolio  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component and an unallocated component 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimate pursuant to either statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all non accrual loans over  which are considered impaired loans 
these analyses involve judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the historical loss element is determined using the average of actual losses incurred over the prior two years for each type of loan 
the historical loss experience is adjusted for known changes in economic conditions and credit quality trends such as changes in the amount of past due and nonperforming loans 
the resulting loss allocation factors are applied to the balance of each type of loan after removing the balance of impaired loans and other specifically allocated loans from each category 
the loss allocation factors are updated annually 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations of credit and changes in portfolio mix 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetectable losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  the unallocated allowance includes a component that accounts for the inherent imprecision in loan loss estimation based on historical loss experience as a result of united s growth through acquisitions  which have expanded the geographic footprint in which it operates  and changed its portfolio mix in recent years 
also  loss data representing a complete economic cycle is not available for all sectors 
uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss 
the historical losses used in developing loss allocation factors may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its processes for determining the allowance adequately consider all the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
additional information on united s loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses can be found in the sections of management s discussion and analysis titled asset quality and risk elements and nonperforming assets and in the sections of part i  item titled lending policy and loan review and non performing assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes additional information on united s accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses 
intangible assets united s intangible assets consist principally of goodwill  representing the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses  and core deposit intangibles 
united s goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more often if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
adverse changes in the economic environment  declining operations of acquired business units  or other factors could result in a decline of the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount  a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill 
these changes or factors  if they occur  could be material to united s operating results for any particular reporting period  the potential effect cannot be reasonably estimated 
other identifiable intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could affect the recoverability of the intangible asset  such as loss of core deposits  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable  an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the intangible assets 
these events or circumstances  if they occur  could be material to united s operating results for any particular reporting period  the potential effect cannot be reasonably estimated 
income tax accounting income tax liabilities or assets are established for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are also established for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and deductions that can be carried forward used in future years 
the valuation of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is considered critical as it requires management to make estimates based on provisions of the enacted tax laws 
the assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities  will not differ from management s current assessment  the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings 
united believes its tax assets and liabilities are properly recorded for the respective periods in the consolidated financial statements 
mergers and acquisitions as part of its balanced growth strategy  united selectively engages in evaluation of strategic partnerships 
mergers and acquisitions present opportunities to enter new markets with an established presence and a capable management team already in place 
united employs certain criteria to ensure that any merger or acquisition candidate meets strategic growth and earnings objectives that will build future franchise value for shareholders 
additionally  the criteria include ensuring that management of a potential partner shares united s community banking philosophy of premium service quality and operates in attractive markets with excellent opportunities for further organic growth 
as part of this strategy  united completed one bank merger in and one bank merger and two branch acquisitions in united will continue to evaluate potential transactions as they are presented 
on june   united completed the acquisition of gwinnett commercial group  inc gwinnett  a bank holding company headquartered in lawrenceville  georgia  and its wholly owned subsidiary first bank of the south 
on june   gwinnett had assets totaling million  including purchase accounting related intangibles 
united exchanged  shares of its common stock valued at million and million in cash for all of the outstanding shares 
first bank of the south was merged into the bank and operates as a separate community bank  united community bank gwinnett 
on december   united completed the acquisition of southern bancorp  inc southern  a bank holding company headquartered in marietta  georgia  and its wholly owned subsidiary southern national bank 
on december   southern had assets totaling million  including purchase accounting related intangibles 
united exchanged  shares of its common stock valued at million for all of the outstanding shares 
southern national bank was merged into the bank 
the cobb county office is now included within united community bank metro  and the cherokee county office operates as a separate community bank  united community bank cherokee 
on september   united completed the acquisition of two western north carolina banking offices in sylva and bryson city 
these offices were acquired from another financial institution  and had million in loans and million in deposits on the date they were acquired 
united paid a premium for these branches of approximately of deposits 
both of these offices are located in markets where united had a presence and were natural extensions of its existing franchise 
operating results much of the discussion contained in this report is presented on an operating basis 
the presentation of operating earnings excludes an million fraud loss provision recorded in and merger related charges in and that are considered non recurring 
the presentation of operating earnings is therefore not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in june  the north carolina attorney general appointed a receiver to take custody of the assets of the developers of two failed real estate developments near spruce pine  north carolina  citing possible fraud on the part of the developers 
united had loans to individual borrowers totaling million secured by undeveloped lots in these developments 
united was one of twelve banks that had loaned money to borrowers to finance the purchase of lots 
the loans were made to appropriately qualified borrowers in accordance with our standard underwriting procedures 
at the time the loans were made  we were not aware that most of the borrowers were simultaneously obtaining loans for additional lots at other banks and thereby taking on debt possibly beyond their repayment ability 
we were also unaware that the borrowers down payments were not paid in cash as indicated on the closing documents  but were financed by the developer and that the developer agreed to service the borrowers debts 
we also subsequently learned that the appraisals relied upon in the underwriting process had been inflated by using comparable sales that were not at arm s length to persons related to the developer and that many of the lots were subdivided into parcels that are too small to be used for their intended purpose 
united recognized a provision for fraud related loan losses of million in related to these loans and charged off an equal amount of loans 
the special provision reduced net income by million and reduced diluted earnings per share by 
in merger related charges in and related to the acquisitions of gwinnett  southern and the two north carolina branches were insignificant and are therefore not shown separately 
pre tax merger related charges of 
million and million were incurred in and  respectively 
these charges decreased net income by 
million and million and diluted earnings per share by 
and  respectively  for and management includes non gaap net operating income because it believes it is useful for evaluating united s operations and performance over periods of time  as well as in managing and evaluating united s business and in discussions about united s operations and performance 
net operating income excludes the pre tax effect of the special million fraud related provision for loan losses in and the merger related charges in and because management believes that the circumstances leading to the provision and such charges were isolated  non recurring events and do not reflect overall trends in united s earnings and financial performance 
management believes this non gaap net operating income provides users of united s financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing united s financial results and credit trends  as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods 
the following is a reconciliation of net operating income to gaap net income 
there were no charges incurred in   or that were excluded from the presentation of operating earnings

net interest revenue taxable equivalent net interest revenue the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and other liabilities is the single largest component of united s revenue 
united actively manages this revenue source to provide an optimal level of revenue while balancing interest rate  credit  and liquidity risks 
net interest revenue totaled million in  a decrease of million  or  from the level recorded in net interest revenue for increased million  or  over the level 
the decrease in net interest revenue for was due primarily to the decline in net interest margin that resulted from many factors including the decrease in the prime interest rate  intensely competitive deposit pricing  efforts to build liquidity and a higher level of non performing assets 
the average yield on loans decreased basis points reflecting the falling prime lending rate through december  on united s predominantly prime based loan portfolio and the increases in non performing loans in the second half of average loans increased million in  or  from the increase from results from the acquisition of gwinnett  which was included in the average balances from the acquisition date of june  loan volume slowed substantially in reflecting weakness in the housing market  particularly in the atlanta msa 
loan balances at year end in the atlanta msa were down million from  and loan volume was down million in north georgia 
in the gainesville msa  western north carolina  east tennessee and coastal georgia  loans were up million  million  million and million  respectively  reflecting the relatively stronger economies in those markets 
competition for deposits kept united from lowering deposit pricing to correspond with the falling rates in its heavily prime based loan portfolio 
the turmoil in the financial services industry  especially in the third and fourth quarters of  added to an already challenging environment as interbank borrowings through federal funds lines became scarce 
united responded to the liquidity concerns by replacing overnight funds with brokered deposits  a more stable but also more expensive funding source  and by building up additional liquidity by investing in short term commercial paper 
later in the fourth quarter  the us government s efforts to stabilize the financial services industry through increasing deposit insurance coverage and its temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp began to take effect  alleviating some of the liquidity concerns 
average interest earning assets for the year increased million  or  over the increase reflects a full year of inclusion of gwinnett  as well as an increase in the investment securities portfolio 
the increase in interest earning assets was entirely funded by interest bearing sources  as the increase in average interest bearing liabilities for the year was million over the average yield on interest earning assets for was down from in  reflecting the effect of lower short term interest rates on united s prime based loans and increased levels of non performing loans 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest revenue  the interest rate spread and the net interest margin 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the effect of non interest bearing deposits and other non interest bearing funding sources and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is an indication of the profitability of a company s investments  and is defined as net interest revenue as a percentage of total average interest earning assets which includes the positive effect of funding a portion of interest earning assets with customers non interest bearing deposits and with stockholders equity 
for  and  united s net interest spread was  and  respectively  while the net interest margin was  and  respectively 
both the net interest margin and net interest spread fell in due to the aggressive competitive pricing for deposits  the effect of the federal reserve s action in lowering short term rates in on united s asset sensitive balance sheet  actions taken to build up liquidity with more expensive deposits  and due to the higher level of non performing assets 
during most of  there was aggressive competition for retail certificates of deposit cds  as banks competed for additional liquidity 
this competition kept retail cd rates relatively high while the prime rate was falling 
in addition  united had a cd special in the second quarter in order to increase liquidity 
this also contributed to the margin compression in the average rate on interest bearing liabilities for was  down from  reflecting the effect of falling rates on united s floating rate liabilities and a changing deposit mix with a higher portion of our overall funding coming from interest bearing sources

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million in  compared with million in  which excludes the million special provision for fraud related loan losses  and million in as a percentage of average outstanding loans  the provision was  
and  respectively  in  and the ratio of net loan charge offs to average outstanding loans for was  compared with 
for  excluding the million in fraud related charge offs  and 
for the provision for loan losses for each year is the amount management believes is necessary to position the allowance for loan losses at an amount adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the increase in the provision for loan losses in reflects the effect of the economic recession in the united states economy and the weak housing market and its effect on united s loan portfolio  primarily in the atlanta msa 
the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of inherent risks in the loan portfolio and the corresponding analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
additional discussions on loan quality and the allowance for loan losses are included in the asset quality section of this report  note to the consolidated financial statements  and above in the critical accounting policies section of this report 
fee revenue fee revenue for was million  compared with million in and million in the following table presents the components of fee revenue 
table fee revenue for the years ended december  in thousands change service charges and fees mortgage loan and related fees consulting fees brokerage fees securities gains losses  net losses on prepayment of borrowings other total fee revenue comparability between current and prior years is affected by the acquisitions completed over the last months 
earnings for acquired companies are included in consolidated earnings after their respective acquisition dates 
service charges and fees of million were up  or  from  most of which is due to having a full year of gwinnett s results included in earnings 
earnings for included gwinnett s results from june  the date of acquisition 
atm and debit card revenue grew  from but that increase was offset by lower overdraft fees 
mortgage loan and related fees of million were down million  or  from mortgage fees were down due to a slowing of demand for mortgages through the year brought on by the weak housing market 
in  united closed  mortgage loans totaling million compared with  loans totaling million in substantially all these originated residential mortgages were sold into the secondary market  including the right to service the loans 
consulting fees of million decreased million  or  from the decrease was primarily due to weakening demand for consulting services as banks sought to lower expenses by postponing or deferring consulting engagements 
in the third and fourth quarters  several consultants were engaged in a project to improve united s financial performance by assisting management in identifying revenue enhancement and expense reduction opportunities 
this project allowed united to maintain the consultants productivity while providing a valuable service to united  however  these services do not result in the recognition of consolidated consulting fee revenue for financial reporting purposes since the services were performed by a wholly owned subsidiary 
brokerage fees decreased  or from the decrease in brokerage fees was due to weak market conditions 
additionally  a portion of united s brokerage fee revenue is derived from the value of assets under management which declined with the overall decline in the market  further contributing to the drop in transaction activity 
united incurred net securities gains of million and million during and  respectively  which resulted from balance sheet management activities 
the gains were offset by losses from the prepayment of fhlb borrowings of million and million  respectively  which were part of the same overall balance sheet management strategy to reduce interest sensitivity and improve the net interest margin 
other fee revenue of million decreased million  or  from the largest contributors to the decrease were lower earnings on bank owned life insurance boli investments  lower earnings on deferred compensation plan assets and a lower earnings credit on float associated with official checks 
additionally  in other fee revenue included  of gains from the sale of foreclosed properties 
the decrease in boli earnings was due to poor performance in the underlying securities in which the cash surrender value had been invested 
the value of the underlying securities  which was comprised of a portfolio of mortgage backed securities  had depreciated significantly since their original purchase as demand for mortgage backed securities fell in the wake of the mortgage crisis 
early in the fourth quarter united surrendered the policies and was able to recover most of its original investment  incurring a tax charge which is further described in the section titled income taxes on page of this report 
operating expense operating expenses were million in as compared to million in and million in the following table presents the components of operating expenses 
table operating expenses for the years ended december  in thousands change salaries and employee benefits communications and equipment occupancy advertising and public relations postage  printing and supplies professional fees foreclosed property fdic assessments and other regulatory charges amortization of intangibles other total operating expenses acquisitions affect expense comparisons between periods since the operating expenses of acquired companies prior to the acquisition date are not included in united s consolidated financial statements 
this affects year over year expense comparisons in the year an acquisition is completed and the year immediately following the acquisition 
in order to assist in understanding the core expense growth trends  operating expense explanations in this section include an estimate for the amount of the increase related to acquisitions where it is possible to reasonably quantify the amount 
salaries and employee benefits expense for was million  a decrease of million  or  from the decrease was due to the elimination of all bonus payments in at december   total staff was  a decrease of from communication and equipment expense for was million  which was relatively flat compared to united was able to leverage decisions to upgrade technology in previous years  keeping expense flat despite a full year of expenses associated with the acquisition of gwinnett 
occupancy expense for was million  an increase of million  or  from the majority of this increase was the result of higher depreciation charges and property taxes related to new banking facilities placed in service over the last months 
advertising and public relations expense for was million  a decrease of million  or  from due to efforts to control discretionary spending 
postage  printing and supplies expense for was million  a decrease of  or  from professional fees were million for  an increase of  or from primarily due to higher legal costs associated with loan workouts 
foreclosed property expense for was million  an increase of million from this expense category includes legal fees  property taxes  marketing costs  utility services  maintenance and repair charges  as well as realized losses and write downs associated with foreclosed properties 
the increase in was due to the higher number of foreclosed properties that were acquired by united and sold throughout the year 
fdic assessments and other regulatory charges expense for was million  an increase of million or from  which is almost entirely due to an increase in fdic insurance assessments 
in january of  the fdic began assessing deposit insurance premiums to re capitalize the deposit insurance fund 
the fdic allowed credits to those banks that had paid deposit insurance previously  which significantly reduced the amount of united s assessment 
for and  the deposit insurance assessment rates for banks in the lowest risk category ranged from basis points to basis points on deposit balances 
united continues to qualify for the lowest risk assessments 
during  united s assessment was at the upper end of the range and beginning in the first quarter of  the fdic will increase the rate by basis points 
other expenses were million for  an increase of million  or  from the increase from was due to million in losses on deferred compensation plan assets and the accrual of a million disputed charge from the transfer of bank owned life insurance investments 
income taxes income tax benefit was million in  compared to income tax expense of million in and million in the effective tax rates as a percentage of pre tax net income were  and for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate is different from the statutory tax rates in effect due to permanent differences between taxable income and pre tax book income such as tax exempt interest revenue on securities and loans 
additional information regarding income taxes  including a reconciliation of the differences between the recorded income tax provision and the amount of income tax computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in accordance with sfas  we reviewed our deferred tax assets and determined that no valuation allowance was necessary 
despite the net loss for and weakness in the housing markets and economy in general  we have a history of strong earnings  are well capitalized  and have positive expectations regarding future taxable income 
the deferred tax asset will be analyzed quarterly for changes affecting realizability  and there can be no guarantee that a valuation allowance will not be necessary in future periods 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
in making decisions regarding any valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence and analyze changes in near term market conditions as well as other factors which may impact future operating results 
fourth quarter discussion taxable equivalent net interest revenue for the fourth quarter of decreased million  or  to million from the same period a year ago primarily due to margin compression 
loans were down million at december  compared to the net interest margin decreased basis points from the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of several factors led to the margin compression including management s efforts to strengthen liquidity  the higher balance of nonperforming assets  competitive pricing pressures on deposits  and the extremely low level the prime rate reached during the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter provision for loan losses was million 
non performing assets totaled million  up million from a year ago 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at december   compared with 
at december  fee revenue of million decreased million  or  from million for the fourth quarter of service charges and fees on deposit accounts decreased  or  to million  primarily due to lower overdraft fees 
mortgage fees decreased  or  to million due to decreased demand during the fourth quarter reflecting the continued softness in the housing market 
united closed million in mortgage loans in the fourth quarter of  which was flat compared with the fourth quarter of consulting fees decreased percent from a year ago to million  reflecting a weakening in the market for consulting services and the use of brintech consultants on internal projects 
united recognized securities gains of  in the fourth quarter  down  from the fourth quarter the gains were offset by losses of million and million in and  respectively  from the prepayment of federal home loan bank advances 
the two transactions were part of the same balance sheet management initiative to reduce funding costs and improve interest sensitivity 
operating expenses increased million to million  a increase from the fourth quarter of salaries and employee benefit costs of million decreased million  or  from the fourth quarter of this decrease was primarily the result of the elimination of bonuses in communications and equipment expenses remained flat at million 
occupancy expense increased  to million due to increased depreciation and property taxes 
professional fees increased  to million reflecting higher legal expenses associated with loan workouts 
postage  printing and supplies expense increased  to million 
advertising and public relations expense decreased  or  reflecting a concerted effort to control expenses 
other operating expense increased million to million primarily due to a million disputed charge from the transfer of boli assets and losses on deferred compensation plan assets

at december   total loans were billion  a decrease of million  or  from december  in  the softening housing market resulted in a much more challenging lending environment and fewer acceptable lending opportunities 
the housing market continued to weaken in  while non performing loans increased to unprecedented levels for united 
most of the loan balance attrition occurred in the atlanta msa in residential construction loans as united worked to reduce its portfolio of residential construction loans 
at december   residential construction loans comprised of united s loan portfolio compared with at december  and at december  the following table presents the composition of united s loan portfolio for the last five years

united s credit administration function is charged with monitoring asset quality  establishing credit policies and procedures and managing the consistent application of these policies and procedures at all of united 
additional information on united s loan administration function is included in item under the heading loan review and non performing assets 
the provision for loan losses is based on management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses 
the amount each year is dependent upon many factors including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies and other credit quality trends  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral  and economic factors and trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed by united s credit administration through analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
reviews of non performing loans  past due loans and larger credits are designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan losses  as well as to determine the adequacy of the allowance and are conducted on a regular basis during the year 
these reviews are performed by the responsible lending officers  a separate loan review function or the special assets department with consideration of such factors as the customer s financial position  prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and other pertinent factors 
the following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for each of the past five years 
table allowance for loan losses years ended december  in thousands balance beginning of period provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses acquired from subsidiaries at merger date charge offs commercial commercial and industrial commercial secured by real estate commercial construction residential construction residential mortgage installment total loans charged off recoveries commercial commercial and industrial commercial secured by real estate commercial construction residential construction residential mortgage installment total recoveries net charge offs balance end of period total loans at year end average allowance as a percentage of year end loans as a percentage of average loans net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance as a percentage of non performing loans excluding impaired loans with no allocated reserve  the coverage ratio was at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate and appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this assessment involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of united  may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses in future periods if the results of their review  in their opinion  warrant such additions 
see the critical accounting policies section for additional information on the allowance for loan losses 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical data  subjective judgment and estimates and  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and the effects of changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in the data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in united s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
consequently  management believes that the unallocated allowance appropriately reflects probable inherent but undetected losses in the loan portfolio

non performing assets  which include non performing loans and foreclosed real estate  totaled million at december   compared with million at year end united s policy is to place loans on non accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the principal and interest on a loan is not likely to be repaid in accordance with the loan terms or when the loan becomes days past due and is not both well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current interest revenue 
interest payments received on non accrual loans are applied as a reduction of principal 
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose loans were on non accrual status at december   although in certain isolated cases  united executed forbearance agreements whereby united will continue to fund construction loans to completion as long as the borrower meets the conditions of the forbearance agreement

the balance of impaired loans at december  of million had specific reserves that totaled million and the balance of impaired loans at december  of million had specific reserves that totaled million 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
united s policy is to discontinue the recognition of interest revenue for loans classified as impaired under sfas no 
when the loan meets the criteria for nonaccrual status 
investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects united s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of revenue 
the securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
total securities available for sale increased million from the end of united continued to purchase securities through as part of a continuing program to help stabilize the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet  to increase net interest revenue and to replace maturing securities 
the increase in the securities portfolio also contributed to strengthening united s liquidity position since the securities were funded with deposits and are therefore available as collateral for secured wholesale borrowings as a source of contingent liquidity 
at december  and  securities available for sale represented and  respectively  of total assets 
at december   the effective duration of the investment portfolio based on expected maturities was years compared with years at december  the following table shows the carrying value of united s securities 
table carrying value of investment securities as of december  in thousands securities available for sale us government agencies state and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities other total securities available for sale the investment securities portfolio consists of us government agency securities  municipal securities  and mortgage backed securities which are primarily us government agency sponsored 
a mortgage backed security relies on the underlying pools of mortgage loans to provide a cash flow of principal and interest 
the actual maturities of these securities will differ from the contractual maturities because the loans underlying the security may prepay without prepayment penalties 
decreases in long term interest rates will generally cause an acceleration of prepayment levels 
in a declining interest rate environment  proceeds may not be able to be reinvested in assets that have comparable yields 
at december   united had of its total investment securities portfolio in mortgage backed securities  compared with at december  as loan demand slowed through  united purchased additional mortgage backed securities in order to obtain a favorable yield with low risk 
united did not have securities of any issuer in excess of of equity at year end or  excluding us government issues

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of investment portfolio and related fair value and maturity information 
goodwill and other intangible assets united s goodwill represents the premium paid for acquired companies above the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including separately identifiable intangible assets 
united evaluates its goodwill annually  or more frequently if necessary  to determine if any impairment exists 
united performed its annual assessment as of december  united engaged the services of a national third party valuation expert who employed commonly used valuation techniques including an earnings approach that considered discounted future expected cash earnings and two market approaches 
the first market approach was the guideline public company method that considered united s implied value by comparing united to a select peer group of public companies and their current market valuation and the second market approach was the merger and acquisition method that considered the amount an acquiring company might be willing to pay to gain control of united based on recent merger and acquisition activity 
united s management concluded that the company s fair value exceeded the carrying value and therefore  no goodwill impairment was recognized 
other intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles representing the value of united s acquired deposit base  are amortizing intangible assets that are required to be tested for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
there were no events or circumstances that lead management to believe that any impairment exists in united s other intangible assets 
deposits total average deposits for were billion  an increase of million  or from average non interest bearing demand deposit accounts decreased million  or  and average now accounts increased million  or  from average time deposits for were billion  up from billion in at december   total deposits were billion compared with billion at the end of  an increase of million  or 
in  aggressive pricing competition for cds made them a less attractive funding source so the bank allowed attrition of higher priced cds where no other customer relationship existed 
in  in an effort to increase liquidity  the bank began competing for cds  despite the aggressive market 
united also increased brokered deposits in order to build additional liquidity 
brokered deposits at december  were million compared with million at december  late in  market cd pricing relaxed  allowing the bank to begin replacing higher priced cds with cds more in line with the current interest rate environment 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of time deposits of  and greater and brokered time deposits

through this affiliation  secured advances totaling million were outstanding at rates competitive with time deposits of like maturities 
the bank anticipates continued use of this short and long term source of funds to minimize interest rate risk and to meet liquidity needs 
the fhlb advances outstanding at december  had both fixed and floating interest rates ranging from up to 
approximately of the fhlb advances mature prior to december  additional information regarding fhlb advances  including scheduled maturities  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity management liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining united s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  both depositors and borrowers 
the primary objective of liquidity management is to ensure that sufficient funding is available  at reasonable cost  to meet ongoing operational cash needs 
while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors  it is the primary goal of united to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in both normal operating conditions and in periods of market or industry stress 
the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  so that united can also meet the investment objectives of its shareholders as market interest rates change 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both goals 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan sales and repayments and the maturities and sales of securities  as well as the ability to use these as collateral for borrowings on a secured basis 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turn over every days as closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
construction and commercial loans that mature in one year or less amounted to billion  or  of the loan portfolio at december  in addition  at december   united had million in commercial paper investments that mature within days 
the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through the stability of deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  brokered deposits  federal reserve discount window borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional wholesale sources of liquidity and represent united s additional borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs 
the table below presents a summary of united s short term borrowings over the last three years 
table short term borrowings as of december  in thousands period end balance period end weighted average interest rate maximum outstanding at any month end average amounts outstanding during the year weighted average rate for the year december  federal funds purchased line of credit repurchase agreements other december  federal funds purchased line of credit repurchase agreements other december  federal funds purchased commercial paper line of credit united had sufficient qualifying collateral to increase fhlb advances by million and federal reserve discount window capacity of million 
united s internal policy limits brokered deposits to of total non brokered deposits 
at december   united had the capacity to increase brokered deposits by million and still remain within this limit 
in addition to these wholesale sources  united has the ability to attract retail deposits at any time by competing more aggressively on pricing 
the following table shows united s contractual obligations and other commitments 
table contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  in thousands maturity by years total or less to to over contractual cash obligations fhlb advances long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations other commitments lines of credit commercial letters of credit uncertain tax positions total other commitments as disclosed in united s consolidated statement of cash flows  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the major source of cash provided by operating activities was noncash expenses of depreciation  amortization and accretion  provision for loan losses and stock based compensation which totaled million which more than offset uses of cash that included the net loss of million  a net decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million and a deferred tax benefit of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million consisted primarily an increase in loans of million  the purchase of premises and equipment of million and the purchase of million of available for sale securities  offset by the maturity of million of available for sale securities and million from the sale of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities provided the remainder of funding sources for the million of net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of a net increase in deposits of million and proceeds from the issuance of series b preferred stock of million 
these increases were partially offset by a net decrease in short term borrowings of million and a net decrease in fhlb advances of million 
in the opinion of management  united s liquidity position at december  is sufficient to meet its expected cash flow requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements united is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued to guarantee a customer s performance to a third party and have essentially the same credit risk as extending loan facilities to customers 
those commitments are primarily issued to local businesses 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
united uses the same credit underwriting procedures for making commitments  letters of credit and financial guarantees as for on balance sheet instruments 
united evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis and the amount of the collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held varies  but may include unimproved and improved real estate  certificates of deposit  personal property or other acceptable collateral 
all of these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the total amount of these instruments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements because a significant portion of these instruments expire without being used 
united is not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments  or that could significantly affect earnings 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on off balance sheet arrangements 
capital resources and dividends shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million  or  from december  accumulated other comprehensive income  which includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and the unrealized gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges  is excluded in the calculation of regulatory capital ratios 
excluding the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive income  shareholders equity increased million  or 
the increase includes million of series b preferred stock issued in connection with the united states treasury s capital purchase program 
cash dividends of million  or 
per share  were declared on common stock in the first half of  a decrease of per share from the amount declared in in order to preserve capital in light of the challenging economic environment  united suspended its cash dividend in the third quarter of and declared a stock dividend of new share for every shares held in the third and fourth quarters 
united has historically retained earnings in order to provide capital for continued growth and expansion 
however  in recognition that cash dividends are an important component of shareholder return  management has targeted a long term payout ratio between and when earnings  capital levels and regulatory conditions permit 
the federal reserve has issued guidelines for the implementation of risk based capital requirements by us banks and bank holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
tier i capital consists of shareholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income and intangible assets goodwill and deposit based intangibles  plus qualifying capital securities 
united s tier i capital totaled million at december  tier ii capital components include supplemental capital such as the qualifying portion of the allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
tier i capital plus tier ii capital is referred to as total risk based capital and was million at december  the ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  on december   united participated in treasury s cpp by selling  shares of series b preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of united s common stock to treasury 
the proceeds of million were allocated between the series b preferred stock and the warrant based on their relative fair values at the time of the sale 
of the million in proceeds  million was allocated to the series b preferred stock and million was allocated to the warrant 
the discount recorded on the series b preferred stock that resulted from allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrant is being accreted directly to into retained earnings over a five year period applying a level yield 
the exercise price of the warrant is and is exercisable at any time on or before december  the series b preferred stock qualifies as tier i capital under risk based capital guidelines and will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter 
the series b preferred stock may be redeemed after december  at the stated amount of  per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
prior to december   the series b preferred stock may be redeemed only with proceeds from the sale of qualifying equity securities 
the series b preferred stock is non voting except for class voting rights on matters that would adversely affect the rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock 
on october   united s subsidiaries united community statutory trust ii and united community statutory trust iii issued trust preferred securities through a private placement 
united community statutory trust ii  which pays interest at a fixed rate of  issued million in trust preferred securities and  in common securities 
united community statutory trust iii  which pays interest at a variable rate of prime plus  issued million in trust preferred securities and  in common securities 
united purchased all of the common securities issued by each trust and received the proceeds from the sale of the common and trust preferred securities by entering into a junior subordinated debenture agreement with the trusts 
the junior subordinated debentures have terms that match the terms of the trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities mature on august  and are callable any time after august  at par 
the trust preferred securities were issued with warrants that allow the holder to redeem the trust preferred securities for united s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants can be exercised at any time prior to august   at which time the warrants expire 
the proceeds of the issuance of the trust preferred securities were allocated between the trust preferred securities and the warrants based on their relative fair values on the date of issuance 
the trust preferred securities qualify as tier i capital under risk based capital guidelines 
united has other outstanding junior subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities totaling million at december  the related trust preferred securities of million excluding common securities qualify as tier i capital under risk based capital guidelines provided that total trust preferred securities do not exceed certain quantitative limits 
at december   all of united s trust preferred securities qualified as tier i capital 
further information on united s trust preferred securities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the bank issued a million subordinated variable rate note  due august  the subordinated note qualifies as tier ii capital under risk based capital guidelines 
the note bears interest at a rate of three month libor 
the note is callable at par at any time 
the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
of the million in subordinated debt that united had outstanding at december   million qualified at tier ii capital under risk based capital guidelines 
a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier i capital divided by quarterly average assets reduced by the amount of goodwill and deposit based intangibles 
a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated bank holding companies which are not undertaking significant expansion programs  but the federal reserve board requires a bank holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
management believes that united s capital must be well above the minimum capital requirements to maintain its business plan 
united s leverage ratio at december  was 
united monitors these capital ratios to ensure that united and the bank remain within regulatory guidelines 
further information regarding the actual and required capital ratios of united and the bank is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effect of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a general business corporation in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important effect on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than nominal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
united s management believes the effect of inflation on financial results depends on united s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary effect on performance 
united has an asset liability management program to monitor and manage united s interest rate sensitivity position 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity management the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant effect on united s profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changing interest rates  in order to achieve united s overall financial goals 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
united s net interest revenue  and the fair value of its financial instruments  are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
united manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by the alco 
the alco meets periodically and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing united s interest rate sensitivity 
the following table shows interest sensitivity gaps for specified intervals 
table interest rate gap sensitivity as of december  in thousands interest sensitivity periods in months immediate to to to over total interest earning assets interest bearing deposits with banks investment securities mortgage loans held for sale loans other interest earning assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now deposits money market deposits savings deposits time deposits fed funds purchased  repurchase agreements other short term borrowings fhlb advances other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest rate derivatives  net non interest bearing deposits interest sensitivity gap cumulative sensitivity gap cumulative gap percent cumulative interest rate sensitivity position as a percent of total interest earning assets 
one of the tools management uses to estimate the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changes in interest rates is an interest rate simulation model 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
the simulation model measures the potential change in net interest revenue over a twelve month period under multiple interest rate scenarios 
the base scenario assumes rates remain flat over the next twelve months and is the scenario to which all others are compared to in order to measure the change in net interest revenue 
a second commonly analyzed scenario is a most likely scenario that projects the most likely change in rates over the next twelve months based on the slope of the yield curve 
other scenarios analyzed may include rate shocks  narrowing or widening spreads  and yield curve steepening or flattening 
united s policy is based on the month impact on net interest revenue of interest rate ramps that increase basis points and decrease basis points from the flat rate scenario 
in the ramp scenarios  rates change basis points per month over the initial eight months 
the policy limits the change in net interest revenue over the next months to a increase or decrease in either scenario 
historically low rates on december  made use of the down basis point scenario problematic 
at december  united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate increase in net interest revenue and a basis point decrease in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate decrease in net interest revenue 
at december   united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate increase in net interest revenue and a basis point decrease in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate decrease in net interest revenue 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the effect of interest rate changes on net interest revenue 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in united s current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate  one to three months  four to twelve months  one to five years  over five years  and on a cumulative basis 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
as demonstrated in the preceding table  of interest bearing liabilities will reprice within twelve months compared with of interest earning assets  however such changes may not be proportionate with changes in market rates within each balance sheet category 
in addition  united may have some discretion in the extent and timing of deposit repricing depending upon the competitive pressures in the markets in which it operates 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly even when the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  due to the two instruments repricing according to different indices 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
these prepayments may have significant effect on the net interest margin 
because of these limitations  an interest sensitivity gap analysis alone generally does not provide an accurate assessment of exposure to changes in interest rates

derivative financial instruments can be a cost effective and capital effective means of modifying the repricing characteristics of on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
these contracts consist of interest rate swaps under which united pays a variable rate and receives a fixed rate and interest rate floor contracts in which united pays a premium to a counterparty who agrees to pay united the difference between a variable rate and a strike rate if the variable rate falls below the strike rate 
united s derivative financial instruments are classified as either cash flow or fair value hedges 
the changes in fair value of derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income from which amounts are reclassified into interest income over time as the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 
fair value hedges recognize currently in earnings both the effect of change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and the offsetting effect of the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability 
at december  united had interest rate swap contracts with a total notional amount of million that were designated as cash flow hedges of prime based loans 
united had interest rate floor contracts with a total notional amount of million that were also designated as cash flow hedges of prime based loans 
at december   united had receive fixed  pay libor swap contracts with a total notional amount of million that were accounted for as fair value hedges of fixed rate liabilities
