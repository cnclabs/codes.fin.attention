table of contents our strategic focus in is to continue to grow our core subscription business and to reduce our cost of deploying and operating our services as a percentage of revenue 
we expect our subscription revenues to increase in compared to due to anticipated growth in demand 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenues in compared to  primarily reflecting our continued emphasis on growing our sales and marketing personnel to support expected demand and create additional awareness in our target market 
while we observe trends of declining travel transactions  increased unemployment and business contraction generally  which tend to reduce revenue  we believe they will be outweighed by cross selling additional services and expansion of our customer base 
we operate in and report on one segment  which is on demand employee spend management solutions

table of contents year ended september  united states europe other total revenues revenues 
subscription revenues consist of fees paid for subscription services  and to a much lesser degree the amortization of set up fees paid to us in connection with those services  and the amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements and in multiple element subscription arrangements where there is no vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for an undelivered subscription element 
subscription revenues are affected by pricing  the number of new customers  customer contract durations and our customer retention rate 
subscription revenues increased  or million  in compared to subscription revenues increased  or million  in compared to these increases reflect increases in the number of customers for our subscription services as well as the gelco acquisition 
the growth in customers reflects increased market demand for our subscription services and strong retention of existing subscription customers 
we believe this expansion is due primarily to the market s continued and growing awareness of our on demand employee spend management solutions  and the increasing acceptance of outsourced services which is driven in part by limited information technology capital budgets 
we expect subscription revenues to continue to grow in as a result of the growing demand for our subscription service offerings and our planned increase in spending on sales and marketing 
consulting and other revenues consist of fees for client services  which include system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training and documentation of procedures 
we anticipate that consulting and other revenues in will fluctuate on a quarterly basis but will be lower in compared to as a percentage of revenues  as fewer existing customers upgrade their on premise license software  and the market continues to shift to the subscription services model 
international revenues 
we expect our international revenues to grow in the near term  as our products and services continue to gain acceptance in international markets  due to our etap acquisition  our investment in global distribution and increased awareness of our products in the international markets 
historically  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our operating results

as of september  and  capitalized internal use software costs  net of amortization  increased million  from million at september   to million at september  we anticipate that recognized systems development and programming costs in will increase in absolute dollars and remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue compared to as we continue to focus on product innovation and enhancement

we expect the absolute dollar amount of general and administrative expenses to increase in compared to due to increases in personnel costs related to the growth of our business 
however  we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue to remain relatively consistent with due to economies of scale 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets represents the amortization of the intangible assets from acquisitions  which includes the gelco acquisition  the etap acquisition  and our acquisition of outtask  inc in january we are amortizing our intangible assets as non cash charges to operations over an expected useful life which is consistent with the timing and level of expected cash flows attributed to customer relationships  use of acquired technology  trade name and trademarks  and non compete agreements

interest income increased during the periods presented reflecting higher levels of interest earning cash and cash equivalent investments 
we record net gains and losses on fluctuations in exchange rates in the other  net line of the income statement 
income tax expense year ended september  change change income tax expense we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
the effective income tax rate for was compared to for this rate increase is primarily due to state income tax increases and reserves for uncertainty in income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income  ongoing  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
if recovery is not likely  we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
financial condition our total assets were million and million as of september  and  representing an increase of  or million

our additional paid in capital totaled million and million as of september  and  a decrease of  or million 
the decrease reflects million used to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock  partially offset by the issuance of shares as part of our acquisition of etap on line  the exercise of stock options under our stock based compensation plans  and the purchase of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our available sources of liquidity as of september   consisted principally of cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
our cash and cash equivalents held at financial institutions generally are in excess of the current federal deposit insurance corporation limits of in addition  we have a revolving credit facility  which is discussed in more detail below 
our operating cash inflows consist of payments received from our customers 
our operating cash outflows consist of employee salaries  payments to vendors directly related to subscription services  payments under arrangements with third parties who provide hosting infrastructure services in connection with our subscription services offerings  related sales and marketing and administrative costs  and systems development and programming costs

the increase in customer funding liabilities  net of changes in restricted cash resulted in million and million in cash provided in and net cash provided by investing activities also included million from the maturities of investments in our financing activities used million in  and provided million and million in and we used million  million and million for the repurchase of  shares   shares and shares of common stock in  and net cash provided by financing activities in  and include the net proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and vesting of share based awards of million  million and million and the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plans of million  million and million 
proceeds from financing activities in included the sale of million shares of newly issued concur common stock to american express for million in net proceeds 
financing activities in included million in net proceeds from the public offering of million shares of concur common stock 
these amounts were partially offset by the net repayment of debt of million in on june   we entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution credit agreement that provides for a revolving loan for up to million and expires in june  or earlier as provided in the credit agreement 
at our option  the interest rate on the revolving loan is equal to either the greater of the federal funds rate plus and the financial institution s publicly announced prime rate at that time  or the london interbank offered rate libor divided by the result of less the federal reserve system s maximum reserve percentage for eurocurrency funding 
we granted security interests in substantially all of our assets as collateral for the loans under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement required compliance with certain covenants  which limit  among other things  our ability to consummate a sale of assets  make changes in our capital structure or pay out dividends 
on october   we amended and restated the credit agreement amended credit agreement  increased the maximum size of the revolving credit facility to million and extended the expiration to september  or on such earlier date as provided in the amended credit agreement 
in addition  on 
table of contents october   we incurred indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of million under the amended credit agreement in connection with the gelco acquisition 
as of september  and  we were in compliance with all loan covenants under the terms of the amended credit agreement and credit agreement 
as of september  and  we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
as of october   our board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program repurchase program that allowed concur to repurchase up to million shares that comprised million shares in january and million shares in september  which both expired in january during  we exhausted the january  authorization for million shares 
in july  our board of directors increased the amount of shares eligible for repurchase in the september  authorization from million to million and extended the repurchase program for an additional two year period expiring in january we may repurchase our common stock from time to time in the open market based on market conditions 
any repurchases will be made at the then current market prices  and repurchased shares will be retired 
as of september   million shares remained eligible for repurchase under the repurchase program 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our credit facilities  as well as expected positive operating cash flows  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for normal business operations  working capital needs and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
in the longer term  or if we decide to acquire assets or businesses  we may require additional funds and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of debt or equity securities  or securities convertible or exchangeable into such securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  lease financing arrangements or other available means 
there can be no assurances that any such funds will be available or  if available  will be on acceptable terms to meet our business needs 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of september  years ending september  capital leases operating leases purchase obligations and thereafter total capital leases we lease equipment  some of which are required to be capitalized if they meet certain criteria  with the related asset recorded in property and equipment and an offsetting amount recorded as a liability

off balance sheet arrangements none 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  such estimates and judgments are periodically re evaluated 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
the estimates and judgments noted above are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those we deem most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  including those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
our critical accounting policies include business combinations  revenue recognition  allowances for accounts receivable  share based compensation and income taxes 
revenue recognition we generate our revenues from the delivery of subscription services which include software maintenance services  and to a much lesser degree  consulting services and the sale of software licenses 
we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies 
we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if collection is not considered probable  we recognize revenues when the fees are collected 
if the fees are not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenues as payments become due from the customer 
accordingly  our judgment as to the probability of collection and determinability of fees may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
if non standard acceptance periods or non standard performance criteria are required  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the acceptance period or satisfaction of the acceptance performance criteria  as applicable 
in contractual arrangements that include the provision of multiple elements  we apply the accounting guidance most applicable to the specific arrangement to determine how contract consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate elements in the arrangement 
multiple element arrangements require the 
table of contents delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
generally  separate contracts with the same customer that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated together and  therefore  are accounted for as a single contractual arrangement in determining how contract consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate elements in the arrangement 
typically  we measure and allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the elements based on their fair value or  if necessary  vendor specific objective evidence of their fair value vsoe 
vsoe is determined by the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price set by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not materially change prior to separate market introduction 
subscription revenues our subscription revenues are typically recognized monthly as the service is provided to the customer and consist of monthly fees paid for subscription services  amortization of related set up fees  and amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements 
set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  such as labor and commissions  are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected lives of the customer relationships  which generally range from two to five years 
for those subscription service offerings that have been commercially available for only a short period of time  the contractual lives are used as the best estimate of the expected lives of the customer relationships 
we continue to evaluate and adjust the length of these amortization periods as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals and contract cancellations 
it is possible that  in the future  the estimates of expected customer lives may change and  if so  the periods over which such subscription set up fees and costs are amortized will be adjusted 
any such change in estimated expected customer lives will affect our future results of operations 
software maintenance services include technical support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
fees for software maintenance services are typically billed annually in advance of performance of the services with provisions for subsequent automatic annual renewals 
we defer the related revenues and recognize them ratably over the respective maintenance terms  which typically are one year 
subscription revenues are adjusted for estimated sales allowances  which are based on our historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to estimates about future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  proprietary technology and non compete agreements  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 

table of contents other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
allowances for accounts receivable we record provisions for estimated sales allowances against subscription and consulting revenues in the period in which the related revenues are recorded 
we record our sales allowances based on historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables  and we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts  included in general and administrative expenses 
in estimating allowances for doubtful accounts  we consider specific receivables when collection is doubtful  as well as an analysis of our historical bad debt experience and the current economic environment 
if the data used to estimate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not adequately reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 
income taxes we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if recovery is not likely  we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
a release of valuation allowance as a result of an acquisition is recorded as reduction of goodwill recognized in the acquisition rather than a tax benefit in the income statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily interest rate and foreign exchange risks 
interest rate risk 
we have borrowing arrangements with variable rates of interest 
we also maintain cash in highly liquid investment vehicles including money market accounts that bear interest at variable overnight or short term rates 
variable interest rate investment and debt exposes us to differences in future cash flows resulting from changes in market interest rates 
variable interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates 
as discussed in note of notes to financial statements  our credit facility bears interest at floating rates we select under the terms of the amended credit agreement 
as of september   we had no outstanding balance on the credit agreement 
the credit facility is not hedged with an interest rate swap 
foreign currency risk 
we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not believe movements in the foreign currencies in which we transact will significantly affect future net earnings 
foreign currency risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates 
we believe such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows or financial instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange risk 
derivatives 
we do not use derivative financial instruments
