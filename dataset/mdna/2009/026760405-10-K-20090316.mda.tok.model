item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an insurance holding company engaged in the insurance and reinsurance business through our wholly owned insurance company  independence american insurance company independence american  our marketing organizations  including our three medical stop loss managing general underwriter subsidiaries our mgus  our two insurance and marketing agencies ipa and hio  and our claims administration company  eca 
since november  amic has been affiliated with independence holding company ihc  which currently owns of amic s stock  and ihc s senior management has provided direction to us through service agreements between us and ihc 
in  independence american s primary source of revenue was reinsurance premiums 
the majority of these premiums are ceded to independence american from ihc under long term reinsurance treaties to cede its gross medical stop loss premiums written to independence american 
in addition  independence american assumes fully insured health and short term statutory disability benefit product in new york state dbl premiums from ihc  and assumes medical stop loss premiums from unaffiliated carriers 
independence american began writing group major medical  medical stop loss  major medical plans for individuals and families  and short term medical in given its a excellent rating from am best  independence american expects to expand the distribution of its medical stop loss products  and increase the business written on its paper  especially major medical plans for individuals and families 
while management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning  the overriding consideration is underwriting profitability 
management s assessment of trends in healthcare and in the medical stop loss market play a significant role in determining whether to expand independence american s health insurance premiums 
since independence american reinsures a portion of all of the business produced by our mgus  and since these companies are also eligible to earn profit sharing commissions based on the profitability of the business they place  our mgus also emphasize underwriting profitability 
in addition  management focuses on controlling operating costs 
by sharing employees with ihc and sharing resources among our subsidiaries  we strive to maximize our earnings

c the combined ratio is equal to the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
in  our mgus and agencies generated revenues of million compared to million in  an increase of  primarily due to income earned by hio  ipa  and higher profit commissions  offset by lower fee income due to the lower volume of premium underwritten 
in  our mgus wrote an aggregate of million of annualized gross premium compared to million in this reduction in premiums was due  in part  to stricter underwriting guidelines and the continuing generally soft market 
the company formed excess claims administrators  inc eca during to provide medical management services and adjudicate claims for our mgus and independent managing general underwriters 
on april   the company purchased the remaining interest in marlton  thereby increasing our interest in this medical stop loss mgu to see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on april   the company acquired a interest in ipa see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies and practices is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements and this management s discussion and analysis 
insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  where material  including legal and other fees  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these loss reserves are based on actuarial assumptions and are maintained at levels that are estimated in accordance with gaap 
the company s estimate of loss reserves represents management s best estimate of the company s liability at the balance sheet date 
all of the company s policies are short duration and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims or open claims from prior periods  including losses incurred for claims that have not been reported ibnr 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
management believes that the company s methods of estimating the liabilities for insurance reserves provided appropriate levels of reserves at december  changes in the company s reserve estimates are recorded through a charge or credit to its earnings 
medical stop loss the company s medical stop loss business is comprised of employer stop loss and hmo reinsurance 
the two primary or key assumptions underlying the calculation of loss reserves for medical stop loss business are i projected net loss ratio  and ii claim development patterns 
the projected net loss ratio is set at expected levels consistent with the underlying assumptions projected net loss ratio 
claim development patterns are set quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history claim development patterns 
the company uses the projected net loss ratio to establish reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
the company has concluded that a reasonably likely change in the projected net loss ratio assumpt ion could have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity material effect but a reasonably likely change in the claim development pattern would not have a material effect 
projected net loss ratio generally  during the first twelve months of an underwriting year  reserves for medical stop loss are first set at the projected net loss ratio  which is determined using assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward 
the projected net loss ratio is the company s best estimate of future performance until such time as developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results 
while the company establishes a best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  actual experience may deviate from this estimate 
this was the case with the  and underwriting years that increased decreased by   and net loss ratio points  respectively 
while the company believes that larger variations are possible  based on the company s experience to date  it is reasonably likely that the actual experience will fall within a range up to five net loss ratio points above or below the expected projected net loss ratio for at december  the impact of these reasonably likely changes at december   would be an increase in net reserves in the case of a higher ratio or a decrease in net reserves in the case of a lower ratio of up to approximately million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserve s in the consolidated statements of operations 
major factors that affect the projected net loss ratio assumption in reserving for medical stop loss relate to i frequency and severity of claims  ii changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation  changes in utilization and demand for medical services  the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols  and iii the adherence by the mgus that produce and administer this business to applicable underwriting guidelines 
changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the projected net loss ratio as discussed above 
claim development patterns subsequent to the first twelve months of an underwriting year  the company s developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate losses 
at this point  claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
development factors based on historical patterns are applied to paid and reported claims to estimate fully developed claims 
claim development patterns are reviewed quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history 
the company must determine whether changes in development represent true indications of emerging experience or are simply due to random claim fluctuations 
the company also establishes its best estimates of claim development factors to be applied to more developed treaty year experience 
while these factors are based on historical claim development patterns  actual claim development may vary from these estimates 
the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its actual claim development patterns would have a material effect 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is more complex than fully insured medical and disability business due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
the level of these deductibles makes it more difficult to predict the amount and payment pattern of such claims 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims  whereas fluctuations in aggregate coverage are largely attributable to frequency of underlying claims rather than severity 
liabilities for first dollar medical reserves and disability coverages are computed using completion factors and expected loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies or deficiencies will typically emerge during the course of the following year rather than over a number of years 
for employer stop loss  as noted above  the company maintains its reserves based on underlying assumptions until it determines that an adjustment is appropriate based on emerging experience from all of its mgus for prior underwriting years 
reserves for hmo reinsurance are adjusted on a policy by policy basis 
because of the small number of hmo reinsurance policies it writes  the company is able to evaluate each policy individually for potential liability by reviewing open claims with each hmo and applying completion factors using historical data 
fully insured health reserves for fully insured medical and dental business are established using historical claim development patterns 
claim development by number of months elapsed from the incurred month is studied each month and development factors are calculated 
these claim development factors are then applied to the amount of claims paid to date for each incurred month to estimate fully complete claims 
the difference between fully complete claims and the claims paid to date is the estimated reserve 
total reserves are the sum of the reserves for all incurred months 
the primary assumption in the determination of fully insured health reserves is that historical claim development patterns are representative of future claim development patterns 
factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures  changes in product design  changes in time delay in submission of claims and the incidence of unusually large claims 
the reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications  the potential impact of any changes in these factors are minimal 
the time delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility 
since our analysis considered a variety of outcomes related to these factors  the company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect 
premium and mgu fee income revenue recognition direct and assumed premiums from short duration contracts are recognized as revenue over the period of the contracts in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
the company records mgu fee income as policy premium payments are earned 
our mgus are compensated in two ways 
they earn fee income based on the volume of business produced  and collect profit sharing commissions if such business exceeds certain profitability benchmarks 
profit sharing commissions are accounted for beginning in the period in which the company believes they are reasonably estimable  which is typically at the point that claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
reinsurance amounts recoverable or paid for under reinsurance contracts are included in total assets or total liabilities as due from reinsurers or due to reinsurers 
in  independence american derived most of its business from pro rata quota share reinsurance treaties with standard security life and madison national life  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of ihc 
these treaties terminate on december   unless terminated sooner by independence american 
standard security life and madison national life must cede at least of their medical stop loss business to independence american under these treaties 
additionally  standard security life  madison national life and independence american have received regulatory approval to cede up to to independence american under most of ihc s medical stop loss programs 
for each of the twelve months ended december  and  standard security life and madis on national life ceded an average of approximately of their medical stop loss business to independence american 
independence american reinsures of standard security life s dbl business 
standard security life and madison national life also ceded approximately of the majority of their fully insured health business to independence american 
in addition  in  independence american ceded of its short term medical stm and major medical for individuals and families business to unaffiliated reinsurers 
income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
management believes that although sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance has been adjusted to account for the expected utilization of net operating losses against future taxable income 
the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire between and us federal and california tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
investments the company accounts for its investments in debt and equity securities under sfas no 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company has classified all of its investments as available for sale or trading securities 
these investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in either accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets for available for sale securities or as unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations for trading securities 
fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
premiums and discounts on debt securities purchased at other than par value are amortized and accreted  respectively  to interest income in the consolidated statements of operations  using the co nstant yield method over the period to maturity 
net realized gains and losses on investments are computed using the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company reviews its investment securities regularly and determines whether other than temporary impairments have occurred 
if a decline in fair value is judged by management to be other than temporary  a loss is recognized by a charge to net realized investment gains in the consolidated statements of operations  establishing a new cost basis for the security 
the factors considered by management in its regular review include  but are not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies  whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments  current expected cash flows  whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or  alternatively  a reflection of general market or industry conditions including  in the case of fixed maturities  the effect of changes in market interest rates  and the company s intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value 
for the twelve months ended december   the company recorded a loss of million for other than temporary impairments from bonds and preferred stocks 
at december   the company had million invested in whole loan cmos backed by alt a mortgages 
of this amount  were in cmos that originated in or earlier and were in cmos that originated in the company s mortgage security portfolio has no direct exposure to sub prime mortgages 
the unrealized loss for the equity securities was primarily due to wider spreads for preferred stocks issued by financial institutions following the disruption in credit markets in late and continuing in some of these financial institutions have exposure to sub prime mortgages 
the unrealized loss for cmo securities is primarily attributable to alt a mortgages as described above 
the unrealized losses on corporate securities are due to wider spreads 
spreads have widened as investors shifted funds to us treasuries in response to the current market turmoil 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which consist of licenses  are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment in the aggregate at the end of the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators arise 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill  further evaluation is required to determine if a write down of goodwill is required 
any impairment write down of goodwill would be charged to expense 
no impairment charge was required in or if the company experiences a sustained decline in its results of operations and cash flows  or other indicators of impairment exist  the company may incur a material non cash charge to earnings relating to impairment of our goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our results

such cash flow is partially used to finance liabilities for insurance policy benefits and reinsurance obligations 
corporate corporate derives cash flow funds principally from dividends and tax payments from its subsidiaries and investment income from corporate liquidity 
other than independence american  there are no regulatory constraints on the ability of any of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to its parent company 
delaware insurance laws and regulations govern the ability of independence american to pay dividends to its parent company 
for the twelve months ended december   our mgus and agencies paid  in dividends to corporate 
cash flows as of december   the company had  of cash  cash equivalents  and investments net of amounts due to from brokers compared with  as of december  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was  net cash flows were the result of insurance revenues and fees from our mgus  partially offset by claims and losses 
net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was  this resulted from purchases of ownership interests in ipa and marlton see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had  of restricted cash at our mgus 
the amount at our mgus is directly offset by corresponding liabilities for premium and claim funds payable of  this asset  in part  represents the premium that is remitted by the insureds and is collected by our mgus on behalf of the insurance carriers they represent 
each month the premium is remitted to the insurance carriers by our mgus 
until such remittance is made the collected premium is carried as an asset on the balance sheet of each of our mgus with a corresponding payable to each insurance carrier 
in addition to the premium being held at our mgus  our mgus are in possession of cash to pay claims 
the cash is deposited by each insurance carrier into a bank account that our mgus can access 
the cash is used by our mgus to pay claims on behalf of the insurance carriers they represent 
the availab ility of cash enables our mgus to reimburse claims in a timely manner 
at december   the company had  of insurance reserves that it expects to pay out of current assets and cash flows from future business 
if necessary  the company could utilize the cash received from maturities and repayments of its fixed maturity investments if the timing of claim payments associated with the company s insurance resources does not coincide with future cash flows 
the company believes it has sufficient cash to meet its currently anticipated business requirements over the next twelve months including the funding of discontinued operations  working capital requirements  and capital investments 
the company expects continued cash usage similar to the amount used in for its discontinued operations  which are primarily lease obligations  for the year ending december  asset quality and investment impairments the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable insurance statutes and regulations which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders 
of the aggregate carrying value of the company s investment assets  approximately was invested in investment grade fixed income securities  securities purchased under resale agreements  and cash and cash equivalents at december  the company s gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
substantially all of these securities were investment grade 
the company holds all fixed maturities and preferred stock as available for sale and accordingly marks all of its securities to market through accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the company does not have any non performing fixed maturities at december  at december   the company had million invested in whole loan collateralized mortgage obligations cmos backed by alt a mortgages 
of this amount  were in cmos that originated in or earlier and were in cmos that originated in while these mortgages have seen lower market values recently  we believe that the unrealized losses on these securities are not necessarily indicative of their ultimate performance 
the company s mortgage security portfolio has no direct exposure to sub prime mortgages 
the decline in fair value for the equity securities was primarily due to wider spreads for preferred stocks issued by financial institutions following the disruption in credit markets in late some of these financial institutions have exposure to sub prime mortgages 
the unrealized loss for cmo securities is primarily attributable to alt a mortgages as described above 
the unrealized losses on corporate securities are due to wider spreads 
spreads have widened as investors shifted funds to us treasuries in response to the current market turmoil 
further deterioration in credit quality of the companies backing the securities  further deterioration in the condition of the financial services industry  a continuation of the current imbalances in liquidity that exist in the marketplace  a continuation or worsening of the current economic recession  or additional declines in real estate values may further affect the fair value of these securities and increase the potential that certain unrealized losses be designated as other than temporary in future periods and the company may incur additional write downs 
the composition of the company s fixed maturities at december   utilizing standard and poor s rating categories  was as follows grade invested aaa aa a bbb bb the company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments 
for  the company recorded a loss of  for other than temporary impairments from bonds and preferred stocks 
the following table summarizes the carrying value of securities with fair values less than of their amortized cost at december  by the length of time the fair values of those securities were below of their amortized cost in thousands greater than greater than months  months  less than less than less than greater than months months months months total fixed maturities equity securities total the company has chosen to carry its fixed maturity securities as available for sale 
the unrealized losses on all available for sale securities have been evaluated in accordance with the company s impairment policy as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and were determined to be temporary in nature at december  in  the company experienced an increase in unrealized losses of  million which decreased stockholders equity by  million reflecting unrealized losses of  million at december  compared to unrealized losses of  million at december  
from time to time  as warranted  the company may employ investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
balance sheet total investments decreased  to  at december  from  at december   due to unrealized losses and impairments of fixed income securities  the acquisitions of marlton  and ipa  and the trading account loss of  net of expected recoveries  taken in the fourth quarter of relating to certain activities engaged in by the non affiliate broker dealer that managed a trading account of the company 
the  decrease in total stockholders equity is primarily due to an increase of  in unrealized losses  offset by net income of  generated during the company had receivables from reinsurers of  at december  substantially all of the business ceded to such reinsurers is of short duration 
all of such receivables are either due from related parties  highly rated companies or are adequately secured 
no allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary at december  capital resources as independence american s total adjusted capital was significantly in excess of the authorized control level risk based capital  the company remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
outlook independence american independence american  which is domiciled in delaware  is licensed to write property and or casualty insurance in states and the district of columbia  and has an a excellent rating from am best company  inc am best 
an am best rating is assigned after an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company s financial condition and operating performance  and is also based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents  and intermediaries  and is not directed towards protection of investors 
am best ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities of the company 
since its acquisition by amic in  independence american s primary source of revenue has been reinsurance premiums 
during  we began to become less dependent on reinsurance premiums as we increased the amount of business written by independence american 
during  independence american wrote group major medical  medical stop loss  major medical plans for individuals and families  and a small amount of short term medical 
given its a excellent rating from am best  independence american expects to expand the distribution of its products 
in late  independence american appointed a second mgu  which is expected to meaningfully increase the amount of medical stop loss business written by independence american in  and we continue to seek additional production sources 
with respect to major medical plans for individuals and families  the acquisition of a controlling interest in ipa  shoul d meaningfully increase the amount of this line of business written by independence american in ihc treaties with respect to the ihc treaties  the company s operating results are affected by the following factors i the percentage of business ceded to independence american pursuant to the ihc treaties  ii the amount of gross premium written by standard security life or madison national life that is ceded to the ihc treaties  and iii the amount of gross premium produced by the mgus and other distribution sources written by carriers other than standard security life or madison national life that is ceded to independence american 
the profitability of the business ceded will also impact our operating results 
independence american assumes medical stop loss  fully insured health and dbl premiums from ihc under the ihc treaties 
percentage of business ceded in and beyond  the percentage of medical stop loss ceded to independence american will depend on how much ihc determines it has available to reinsure and independence american s desire to reinsure ihc s business 
since the percentage being ceded is now well in excess of the contractual minimum  there is no guaranty that ihc will continue to increase the percentage of business ceded to independence american or  in fact  cede in excess of 
however  our mgus are the largest producers of medical stop loss business for ihc  controlling a majority of this premium in independence american reinsures of standard security life s dbl product 
standard security life is not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to independence american after termination of the current treaty year 
standard security life and madison national life ceded approximately of the majority of their fully insured health business to independence american 
standard security life and madison national life are not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to independence american after termination of the current treaty years 
the company does not expect the percentage ceded to it from ihc will change significantly in the next twelve months 
if independence american  standard security life  and madison national life had agreed to increase the average percentage ceded to independence american by from the approximately ceded for the twelve months ended december  and standard security life s and madison national life s gross written premium had remained unchanged  independence american s premium would have increased by approximately million  which is approximately of total net premiums earned for the year ended december  that increase in premium  however  would not have flowed directly to pre tax operating income because of corresponding changes in insurance benefits  claims and reserves and other expenses attributable to the increase in premiums 
amount of premiums written the gross medical stop loss premiums written by ihc decreased in by and such premiums produced by our mgus decreased by in as a result of writing and or renewing fewer policies due to competitors willingness to write business at profit margins lower than those acceptable to the company  partially offset by increased rates on the policies retained
