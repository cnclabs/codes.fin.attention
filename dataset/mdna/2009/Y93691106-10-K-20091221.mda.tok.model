in the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million adjustment in interest income and other  related to foreign currency remeasurement gains 
these gains related to a failure to remeasure certain foreign currency assets and liabilities  primarily value added tax receivables  arising in fiscal years  and the first two quarters of fiscal year management has assessed the impact of this adjustment and does not believe the amounts are material  either individually or in the aggregate  to any of the prior years financial statements  and the impact of correcting these errors in the third quarter of fiscal year was not material to the full fiscal year financial statements 

table of contents business summary prior to our initial public offering  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of agilent technologies  inc agilent 
we became an independent company on june   when we separated from agilent 
on june   we completed our initial public offering and became a separate stand alone publicly traded company focused on technology and innovation in semiconductor testing 
we design  develop  manufacture and sell advanced test systems and solutions for the semiconductor industry 
we offer a single platform for each of the general categories of devices being tested our v series platform  designed to test system on a chip soc  system in a package sip and high speed memory devices  our v series platform  which is the successor to the v platform  designed to test both flash memory and dynamic random access memory dram devices  and our v platform  introduced in the third quarter of fiscal year  designed to test highly cost sensitive devices such as  and bit micro controller units mcus 
our test platforms are scalable across different frequency ranges  different pin counts and different numbers of devices under simultaneous test 
the test platforms flexibility also allows for a single test system to test a wide range of semiconductor device applications 
our scalable platform strategy allows us to optimize operational efficiencies such as research and development investments  engineering headcount  support requirements and inventory risk 
this platform strategy also provides economic benefits to our customers by allowing them to bring their complex  feature rich semiconductor devices to market quickly and to reduce their overall costs 
in addition to our test platforms  our product portfolio includes advanced micro electro mechanical systems mems probe cards  advanced analysis tools  as well as consulting  service and support offerings such as start up assistance  application services and system calibration and repair 
as of october   we have installed more than  v series systems and nearly  v series systems worldwide 
we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers idms  test subcontractors  also referred to as subcontractors or osats outsourced sub assembly and test providers  which includes specialty assembly  package and test companies as well as wafer foundries  and companies that design  but contract with others for the manufacture of  integrated circuits ics known as fabless design companies 
overview of results our total net revenue for fiscal year was million  down million  or  from million in fiscal year the decrease was due to lower revenue from sales of our memory and soc platforms 
the decline in both of our businesses resulted from substantial declines in the capital spending patterns of semiconductor manufacturer customers and of their subcontractor test partners to which we also sell our products 
the crisis in the global economy and financial markets has driven companies to reassess their use of cash and has negatively impacted consumer confidence 
many of our customers have undertaken or announced restructuring activities and significant cost cuts to their capital spending budgets 
these factors have caused our customers to delay test system purchases 
despite the challenging business environment  in the second half of fiscal year  customers began to see utilization rates improve and some increased demand primarily from the cell phone and personal computer markets 
we have begun to see positive signs in both the soc and memory markets and although our quarterly revenue hit an all time low in the first quarter of fiscal year  our revenue has increased for three consecutive quarters  and we anticipate the upward trend to continue through fiscal our gross margin for fiscal year was  a decrease of percentage points compared to fiscal year gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by the overall decline in product sales with a larger percentage of revenue being generated from service and support  which generally has a lower gross margin than our products 
we also incurred higher expenses related to our restructuring and manufacturing transition actions 
this was partially offset by lower excess and obsolete charges as we incurred significant charges in fiscal year primarily due to the extraordinary drop in memory tester demand in general as well as the impact of the 
table of contents introduction of our new v product 
the net impact of excess and obsolete inventory charges and the benefit from the sales of previously written down inventory on gross margin was million for fiscal year compared to million recorded for fiscal year our total operating expenses  including restructuring charges of million  were million in fiscal year  down million  or  from fiscal year this decrease in operating expenses from fiscal year was primarily driven by lower compensation costs  cost savings from our restructuring actions  site shut downs and lower overall discretionary spending 
this was partially offset by a million in process research and development charge and operating expenses related to our acquisition of touchdown technologies 
net loss for fiscal year was million  compared to net income of million achieved in fiscal year the fiscal year loss was primarily due to the overall decline in revenue  combined with other than temporary impairments of million related to write downs of our investments  million of restructuring charges  million in process research and development charge and operational expenses related to our acquisition of touchdown technologies 
in fiscal year  we used million in cash for operating activities 
on july   we received net proceeds of million related to our issuance of convertible senior notes the notes 
the notes will mature on july   and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the interest is payable semi annually on january th and july th of each year and payments commence on january  our cash and cash equivalents balance as of october  was million 
we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue from outside of north america 
net revenue from customers located outside of north america represented  and of total net revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
net revenue in north america as a percentage of total net revenue was higher by percentage points in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  while net revenue in asia as a percentage of total net revenue  was lower by percentage points in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year however  we expect a majority of our sales to be generated in the asia region as semiconductor manufacturing activities continue to concentrate in that region 
the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
these cyclical periods have had  and will continue to have a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry 
historically  these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations 
this was particularly relevant beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year when we saw a significant decrease in revenue from our memory platform and experienced some order postponements 
we also experienced a similar downturn for our soc business during fiscal year due to the deteriorating global economy  which has negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry 
the sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 
while we sell to a variety of customers  subcontractors represent a large portion of our customer base 
during market troughs  these subcontractors tend to decrease or postpone orders for new test systems and test services more quickly and dramatically as they are more capacity driven than other customers 
as a result  industry downturns may cause a quicker and more significant adverse effect on our business than on the broader semiconductor industry 
in addition  although a decline in orders for semiconductor capital equipment may accompany or precede the timing of a decline in the semiconductor market as a whole  recovery in semiconductor capital equipment spending may lag the recovery by the semiconductor industry 
we are feeling increasingly optimistic about the soc and memory markets and believe that the worst is now behind us 
our product development efforts in dram and low end soc as well as our acquisition of touchdown technologies have strengthened our product portfolio 
as a result of these investments and the improving industry environment  we expect to deliver revenue growth in fiscal year we have achieved our 
table of contents quarterly cost and expense goals by reducing our annualized cost structure by approximately million since our fourth quarter of fiscal year  which includes savings from restructuring activities as described above and a combination of other temporary and permanent cost saving measures 
we will maintain tight financial management and we expect to return to profitability by our second quarter of fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and of actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies are revenue recognition  restructuring  inventory valuation  warranty  share based compensation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets  valuation of marketable securities and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
net revenue is derived from the sale of products and services and is adjusted for estimated returns and allowances  which historically have been insignificant 
we recognize revenue on the sale of semiconductor test equipment when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  for products  or when service has been performed 
we consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments 
at the time we take an order  we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
for sales or arrangements that include customer specified acceptance criteria  including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones or fulfillment of other future obligations  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
if the criteria are not met  then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of test equipment 
software is embedded in many of our test equipment products  but the software component is considered to be incidental 
for revenue arrangements that include multiple elements  we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us for products that include installation  if we have previously successfully installed similar equipment  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete 
otherwise  neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete 
revenue from services includes extended warranty  customer support  consulting  training  and education services 
service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered to the customer 
for example  customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period  while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer 
in addition  all of the revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized 
we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to elements in multiple element arrangements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
in the absence of objective evidence of fair value of a delivered element  we allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
the price charged when an element is sold separately generally determines fair value 
restructuring 
we recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded 
these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
the three main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reductions  consolidating 
table of contents facilities and asset impairments 
workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred  which is generally when individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments 
plans to eliminate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges  net of estimated future sublease income 
we recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises 
asset impairments primarily consist of property  plant and equipment associated with excess facilities being eliminated  and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of the property  plant and equipment 
these estimates were derived using accounting principles generally accepted in the us if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated  the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different  either higher or lower  than those we have recorded 
in order to address the cyclical downturn and the negative impact on our results driven by the deteriorating global economy  in fiscal year we implemented restructuring actions to streamline our organizations and further reduce our operating costs 
as market conditions continued to deteriorate  in the second quarter of fiscal year  we announced a plan to expand our restructuring actions to further lower our quarterly operating costs in fiscal year as part of these restructuring actions  we reduced our global workforce through a combination of attrition  voluntary and involuntary terminations and other workforce reduction programs consistent with local legal requirements 
the total charges incurred in fiscal year for these restructuring actions were approximately million  million was recorded within cost of sales and the remainder of which was recorded within operating expenses 
at october   we achieved our quarterly cost and expense goals by reducing our annualized cost structure by approximately million since the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which includes savings from restructuring activities as described above and a combination of other temporary and permanent cost saving measures 
inventory valuation 
we assess the valuation of our inventory  including demonstration inventory  on a quarterly basis based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage 
to the extent that we determine that we are holding excess or obsolete inventory  we write down the value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
such write downs are reflected in cost of products and can be material in amount 
the net impact of excess and obsolete inventory charges and the benefit from the sales of previously written down inventory on gross margin was million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year our inventory assessment involves difficult estimates of future events and  as a result  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold to customers  resulting in lower cost of products and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
excess and obsolete inventory resulting from shifts in demand or changes in market conditions for raw materials and components can result in significant volatility in our costs of products 
in our inventory valuation analysis  we also include inventory that we could be obligated to purchase from our suppliers based on our production forecasts 
to the extent that our committed inventory purchases exceed our forecasted productions needs  we take a charge to our cost of products and establish a supplier liability for such amounts 
warranty 
we generally provide a one year warranty on products commencing upon installation or delivery 
we accrue for warranty costs  based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percent of gross product shipments 
estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time revenue is recognized and the liability is reported in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates 
for some products  we also offer extended warranties beyond one year 
costs associated with our extended warranty contracts beyond one year are expensed as incurred 
share based compensation 
on november   we adopted accounting guidance for share based awards 
under this guidance  share based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair 
table of contents value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight line basis for awards granted after november  over the vesting period of the award 
our estimate of share based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
we incurred million  million  and million in share based compensation expense during fiscal years   and  respectively 
also see note  share based compensation for additional information 
retirement and post retirement plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business 
they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations  we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of us gaap 
two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term return on plan assets 
other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate  expected future salary increases  expected future increases to benefit payments  expected retirement dates  employee turnover and retiree mortality rates 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date or october the discount rate for us plans was determined based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds 
the discount rate for non us plans was generally determined in a similar manner 
differences between the expected future cash flows of our plans and the maturities of the high quality corporate bonds are not expected to have a material impact on the selection of discount rates 
as discount rates decrease  we would expect our net plan costs to increase and as discount rates increase we would expect our net plan costs to decrease 
on october   we adopted an accounting guidance for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the accounting guidance required recognition of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position reflecting the funded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans such as retiree health and life  with current year changes recognized in shareholders equity 
in fiscal year  in order to recognize the funded status of our pension and post retirement benefit plans in accordance with this accounting guidance  we recorded additional liabilities by a cumulative amount of million  of which million net of tax of million was recorded as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these losses are being recognized over the expected average future service lives of plan participants 
also see note  retirement plans and post retirement benefits 
the expected long term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns 
declining rate of return assumptions generally result in increased pension expense while increasing rate of return assumptions generally result in lower pension expense 
a one percent change in the estimated long term return on our pension plan assets would result in a million impact on pension expense for our fiscal year there are no plan assets related to our post retirement health care plans 
workforce related events such as restructurings or divestitures can result in curtailment and settlement gains or losses to the extent they have an impact on the average future working lifetime or total number of participants in our retirement and postretirement plans 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
based on our fiscal year impairment assessment  we concluded that we did not have any impairment as of october  
table of contents our accounting for goodwill and purchased intangible assets complies with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time that impairment indicators arise 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to significant decrease in market price of an asset  significant adverse changes in the extent or use or physical condition of an asset  significant adverse change in legal or regulatory factors affecting an asset  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of expected costs to acquire or construct an asset  operating or cash flow losses or projections of losses that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset  or a current expectation that more likely than not  an asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
we estimate expected future cash flows then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed using the straight line method over the economic lives of the respective assets  generally three to five years 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
valuation of marketable securities 
we account for our short term marketable securities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we classify our marketable securities as available for sale at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation as of each consolidated balance sheet date 
we amortize premiums and discounts against interest income over the life of the investment 
our marketable securities are classified as cash equivalents if the original maturity  from the date of purchase  is ninety days or less 
for those investments that we intend to sell or more likely than not would be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis  we recognized other than temporary impairment charges in earnings representing both credit and non credit loss 
our marketable securities include commercial paper  corporate bonds  government securities  money market funds and auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are securities that are structured with interest rate reset periods of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of years 
at the end of each interest rate reset period  investors can buy  sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
as of october   all of our auction rate securities experienced failed auctions 
the funds associated with these auctions will not be accessible to us until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured or are called by the issuer 
given the ongoing disruptions in the credit markets and the fact that the liquidity for these types of securities remains uncertain  we have classified all of our auction rate securities as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of october   as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next months is uncertain 
our auction rate securities primarily consist of investments that are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education and other asset backed securities 
our marketable securities portfolio as of october  had a carrying value of million  of which approximately million consisted of illiquid auction rate securities 
given the ongoing disruption in the market for auction rate securities  there is no longer an actively quoted market price for these securities 
accordingly  we utilized a model to 
table of contents estimate the fair value of these auction rate securities based on  among other items i the underlying structure of each security and the underlying collateral quality  ii the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  iii consideration of the probabilities of default  auction failure or repurchase at par for each period  and iv estimates of the recovery rates in the event of default for each security 
these estimated fair values could change significantly based on future market conditions 
we evaluate our investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and insurance guarantor  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value 
based on an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  we recorded an other than temporary impairment in the statement of operations of million for the fiscal year ended october  related to our auction rate securities  of which million was recorded as an impairment during the three months ended october  we have also recorded an unrealized gain within accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately million net of tax of million  primarily for our auction rate securities that are backed by pools of student loans as of october  investments in money market funds include investments in the reserve primary fund and the reserve international liquidity fund collectively referred to as the reserve funds 
the net asset value for the reserve funds fell below because the funds had holdings of commercial paper and other notes with a major investment bank which filed for bankruptcy on september  as a result of these events  these funds are no longer classified as cash and cash equivalents 
we have classified these investments as short term marketable securities because  based on the maximum maturity date of the underlying securities as well as the proposed liquidation plan and distribution updates received for the funds  we believe that within one year  these investments will be redeemable 
we received approximately million from the distribution of these funds during fiscal year  reducing the value of our remaining holdings of these funds to million as of october  accounting for income taxes 
we adopted accounting guidance for the uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation clarifies the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits  and requires additional disclosures about uncertain tax positions 
under this accounting guidance  the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority 
if this threshold is met  the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this guidance required us to reclassify the majority of our uncertain tax positions from current to non current in fiscal year it does not allow for retroactive treatment or presentation 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations 
we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we are required to assess the realization of our net deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance 
this assessment requires that our management make judgments about benefits that could be realized from future taxable income  as well as other positive and negative factors influencing the realization of deferred tax assets 
we had a valuation allowance of million as of october   compared to million such allowances as of october  the net increase of this valuation allowance is attributable to deferred taxes related to capital losses which can only be realized through the generation of future capital gains 

table of contents undistributed earnings of our domestic us and foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested in the respective operations 
no provision has been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such earnings  nor is it practicable to determine the amount of this liability 
our effective tax rate varies based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate  restructuring and other one time charges  as well as discrete events  such as settlements of future audits 
we are subject to audits and examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions  including the internal revenue service 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes

service revenue for fiscal year accounted for million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue in fiscal year unlike product revenue  service revenue tends not to experience significant cyclical fluctuations due to the fact that service contracts generally extend for one to two years and revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered 
as such  the decline in our service revenue was not as severe during fiscal year as the decline in revenue for products

cost of services for fiscal year was million higher compared to fiscal year cost of services as a percent of service revenue increased by percentage points  from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this margin deterioration was primarily due to the fact that we were putting more service capability in place for product introductions and had experienced slight erosion in our average selling price of our extended service and support contracts 
in addition  we had higher material costs and experienced higher consumption  and had an unfavorable currency impact during the period 
our cost of services included million and million of share based compensation expense in fiscal years and  respectively 

table of contents as a percent of service revenue  cost of services will vary depending on a variety of factors  including the effect of price erosion  the reliability and quality of our products and our need to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide 
operating expenses research and development expenses year ended october  over change over change in millions research and development as a percent of net revenue research and development 
research and development expense includes costs related to salaries and related compensation expenses for research and development and engineering personnel  materials used in research and development activities  outside contractor expenses  depreciation of equipment used in research and development activities  facilities and other overhead and support costs for the personnel  as well as in process research and development related to our acquisitions 
research and development costs have generally been expensed as incurred 
research and development expense decreased by million in absolute dollars in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to cost savings from our restructuring actions  primarily lower compensation and benefit costs and lower discretionary spending 
it also reflected lower expenses for product development activities primarily from our memory business due to the recent release of the v product in the first quarter of fiscal year these reductions were partially offset by a million in process research and development charge  as well as incremental operating expenses related to our acquisition of touchdown technologies 
we also wrote down approximately million of purchased intellectual property and incurred higher costs during fiscal year to support the recent introduction of our v platform 
research and development expense also included million and million of share based compensation expense for fiscal years and  respectively 
research and development expense as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage points from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the significantly lower revenue levels in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year research and development expense increased by million in absolute dollars in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to higher expenses to support product development activities for memory products released in the first quarter of fiscal year and soc products planned for release during fiscal year research and development expense also included million and million of share based compensation expense for fiscal years and  respectively 
research and development expense as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage points from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the increase in research and development expense as a percent of revenue reflected the higher level of absolute spending combined with the lower revenue in fiscal year we believe that we need to maintain a significant level of research and development spending in order to remain competitive and  as a result  we expect our research and development expenses to only vary modestly in dollar amount from period to period  and to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue based on revenue levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended october  over change over change in millions selling  general and administrative as a percent of net revenue

selling  general and administrative expense decreased by million in absolute dollars in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decrease was due to cost savings from our restructuring actions  primarily lower compensation and benefit costs and lower discretionary spending 
these costs were partially offset by higher share based compensation expenses as well as incremental operating expenses related to our acquisition of touchdown technologies 
selling  general and administrative expense included approximately million of share based compensation expenses in fiscal year  compared to million of such expenses in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expense increased by million in absolute dollars in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher field selling costs and higher share based compensation expenses  operating expenses associated with the acquisition of inovys and increased governance costs 
selling  general and administrative expense included approximately million of share based compensation expenses in fiscal year  compared to million of such expenses in fiscal year restructuring charges in fiscal year  we offered an early retirement plan to a number of eligible employees 
the total net charges incurred in fiscal year for this early retirement plan were approximately million  which was recorded within operating expenses 
in order to address the cyclical downturn and the negative impact on our results driven by the deteriorating global economy  in fiscal year we implemented restructuring actions to streamline our organizations and further reduce our operating costs 
as market conditions continued to deteriorate  in the second quarter of fiscal year  we announced a plan to expand our restructuring actions to further lower our quarterly operating costs in fiscal year as part of these restructuring actions  we reduced our global workforce through a combination of attrition  voluntary and involuntary terminations and other workforce reduction programs consistent with local legal requirements 
the total charges during fiscal year for our restructuring actions were approximately million  million of which was recorded within cost of sales and the remainder of which was recorded within operating expenses 
as of october   we had approximately million of accrued restructuring liability included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the accrual relates to severance and benefit payments and are expected to be paid out by the end of fiscal year at october   we achieved our quarterly cost and expense goals by reducing our annualized cost structure by approximately million since the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which includes savings from restructuring activities as described above and a combination of other temporary and permanent cost saving measures

we recorded an million other than temporary impairment charge for fiscal year for our auction rate securities 
during fiscal year  we incurred an million charge related to the write off of cost based equity investment that was determined to be impaired on an other than temporary basis 
additionally  we have recorded other than temporary impairments within the statement of operations for the fiscal year of million related to auction rate securities and million related to our money market funds 
see note  marketable securities and note  other long term assets 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million  million and million for fiscal years ended   and  respectively 
the decrease in our income tax provision is primarily attributable to a loss before income taxes of million during fiscal year  compared to income before income taxes of million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year our current provision for income taxes relates to amounts due in foreign jurisdictions which had taxable income 
as of october  and  we had million and million of net deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the net assets 
management periodically evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets and the need for any valuation allowance based on all available 
table of contents evidence  both positive and negative in accordance with the accounting guidance for income taxes 
in performing this analysis  management considered the impact of veirgy s current year consolidated loss before income taxes of million and the factors giving rise to such losses  as well as the lack of any carryback potential for the net operating losses included in the deferred tax assets 
management further considered various factors for each jurisdiction including historical evidence of profitability  expectations of future taxable income  indefinite loss carryovers in singapore and the historical profitability of most jurisdictions due to verigy s tax structure 
after evaluating both negative and positive factors  we determined that no valuation allowance is needed for the net deferred tax assets of million as of october   and based on the available evidence  we concluded that its more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
we have  however  established a valuation allowance of million for the portion of our deferred tax assets related to capital losses for which we do not expect to be able to realize 
this is a million increase from the balance of million as of october  the provisions for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements have been determined on a separate return basis 
we are required to assess the realization of our net deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance 
this assessment requires that our management make judgments about benefits that could be realized from future taxable income  as well as other positive and negative factors influencing the realization of deferred tax assets 
based on our earnings history and projected future taxable income  management determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets not arising from capital losses would be realized 
our effective tax rate varies based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate  restructuring and other one time charges  as well as discrete events  such as settlements of future audits 
we are subject to audits and examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions  including the internal revenue service 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested in the respective operations 
no provision has been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such earnings  nor is it practicable to determine the amount of this liability 
we adopted accounting guidance for the uncertainty in income taxes 
this guidance clarifies the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits  and requires additional disclosures about uncertain tax positions 
under this accounting guidance  the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority 
if this threshold is met  the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we have recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations 
also see note  provision for income taxes 
goodwill and other long lived assets our goodwill balance as of both october  and was million and represents an allocation of goodwill recorded during the separation from agilent 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach that uses discounted cash flows and the market approach that utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
we have two reporting units for which we assess goodwill for impairment 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of intangible assets related to our acquisition of touchdown technologies with a weighted average amortization period of years 
these assets will be amortized on a straight line basis with an estimated future amortization expense of approximately million a year 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived 
table of contents assets may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
we performed an interim goodwill and long lived asset impairment analysis during the three months ended january  because of the sharp deterioration in our operating results 
based on this interim assessment  we concluded that we did not have any impairment as of january  we completed our annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and we concluded that we did not have any impairment as of october  financial condition liquidity and capital resources as of october   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million as of october  this increase in cash was primarily due to net cash proceeds of million from the issuance of our convertible senior notes in july  partially offset by the net loss of million 
net cash used in provided by operating activities in fiscal year  we used million in cash for operating activities  compared to million generated in fiscal year the million used during fiscal year  was primarily a result of million of net loss  an increase of million in inventory  and decreases of million in payables  million in employee compensation and benefits  million in deferred revenue  million in income tax and other taxes payable  and a change in net assets of million in other current and long term assets and liabilities 
this was offset by a million reduction in receivables as a result of customer payments 
also during fiscal year  we had non cash charges of million from depreciation and amortization expense  million from an in process research and development charge related to our acquisition of touchdown  million from gross excess and obsolete inventory provisions  million of net share based compensation costs and a million impairment loss on marketable securities and a cost method investment 
in fiscal year  we generated million in cash from operating activities  compared to million in fiscal year the million cash generation during fiscal year was a result of million of net income  a million reduction in receivables as a result of customer payments  and a change in net assets of million 
also during fiscal year  we had non cash charges of million from depreciation and amortization expense  million from gross excess and obsolete inventory provisions  million of net share based compensation costs  a million impairment loss on marketable securities and a cost based equity investment  and a million loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment 
these impacts were partially offset by an increase of million in inventory primarily due the purchase of raw materials relating to our service and support business and the introduction of our new v which was released in the first quarter of fiscal year  and decreases of million in income tax and other taxes payable  million in employee compensation and benefits  million in payables  and million in deferred revenue 
net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year was million  compared to million used in fiscal year the net cash generated was primarily related to the proceeds from the maturities and sales of available for sale marketable securities of million and proceeds from the disposition of assets of million 
this was partially offset by purchases of available for sale marketable securities of million and investments made for property  plant and equipment of million 
our marketable securities include commercial 
table of contents paper  corporate bonds  government securities  money market funds and auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are securities that are structured with interest rate reset periods of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of years 
at the end of each interest rate reset period  investors can buy  sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
as of october   all of our auction rate securities experienced failed auctions 
the funds associated with these auctions will not be accessible to us until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured or are called by the issuer 
given the ongoing disruptions in the credit markets and the fact that the liquidity for these types of securities remains uncertain  we have classified all of our auction rate securities as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of october   as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next months is uncertain 
our auction rate securities primarily consist of investments that are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education and other asset backed securities 
our marketable securities portfolio as of october  had a carrying value of million  of which approximately million consisted of illiquid auction rate securities 
given the ongoing disruption in the market for auction rate securities  there is no longer an actively quoted market price for these securities 
accordingly  we utilized a model to estimate the fair value of these auction rate securities based on  among other items i the underlying structure of each security and the underlying collateral quality  ii the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  iii consideration of the probabilities of default  auction failure or repurchase at par for each period  and iv estimates of the recovery rates in the event of default for each security 
these estimated fair values could change significantly based on future market conditions 
we evaluate our investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and insurance guarantor  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value 
based on an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  we recorded an other than temporary impairment in the statement of operations of million for the fiscal year ended october  related to our auction rate securities  of which million was recorded as an impairment during the three months ended october  we have also recorded an unrealized gain within accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately million net of tax of million  primarily for our auction rate securities that are backed by pools of student loans as of october  investments in money market funds include investments in the reserve primary fund and the reserve international liquidity fund collectively referred to as the reserve funds 
the net asset value for the reserve funds fell below because the funds had holdings of commercial paper and other notes with a major investment bank which filed for bankruptcy on september  as a result of these events  these funds are no longer classified as cash and cash equivalents 
we have classified these investments as short term marketable securities because  based on the maximum maturity date of the underlying securities as well as the proposed liquidation plan and distribution updates received for the funds  we believe that within one year  these investments will be redeemable 
we received approximately million from the distribution of these funds during fiscal year  reducing the value of our remaining holdings of these funds to million as of october  on june   we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of touchdown technologies  inc the consideration payable in the acquisition consists of contingent consideration payable based on revenue from probe card sales during a five year period beginning november  there is no minimum or maximum amount of contingent consideration payable pursuant to the acquisition agreement 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million  compared to million used in fiscal year the net cash used was primarily related to purchases of available for sale marketable 
table of contents securities of million  cash paid for the acquisition of inovys and other investments of million  net of cash acquired  as well as the investments made in our property  plant and equipment of million 
this was partially offset by the net proceeds from the sales and maturities of available for sale marketable securities of million 
in addition  we reclassified approximately million of cash and cash equivalents to short term marketable securities 
net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year was million  compared to million used in fiscal year the million net cash provided in fiscal year was comprised of net cash proceeds of million from the issuance of million of convertible senior notes  million from the issuance of shares under employee stock plans including contributions by participants to our employee shares purchase plan  pursuant to which  shares and  shares were issued in first and third quarter of fiscal year  offset by million of repurchases of our ordinary shares made pursuant to the repurchase program approved by our shareholders in the second quarter of fiscal year on july   we issued million of convertible senior notes 
the notes will mature on july   and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the interest is payable semi annually on january th and july th of each year and payments commence on january  net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year was million  compared to million provided in fiscal year in the second quarter of fiscal year  our shareholders approved a share repurchase program  which provided our directors authority to acquire up to percent  or approximately million shares  of our outstanding ordinary shares 
the million net cash used in fiscal year was comprised of approximately million of repurchase and retirement of ordinary shares  offset by million of excess tax benefits from share based compensation  million from the issuance of shares under employee stock plans including contributions by participants to our employee shares purchase plan  pursuant to which  shares and  shares were issued in the first and third quarter of fiscal year  respectively 
other our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world 
local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to affect our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of approximately million as of october   will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity needs at least through the next twelve months 
we may require or choose to obtain debt or equity financing in the future 
however  it is uncertain that additional financing  if needed  will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations and commitments contractual obligations our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at october  in millions in millions total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating and capital leases commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers other purchase commitments convertible senior note and related interest long term liabilities total the contractual obligations table excludes our long term income taxes payable liabilities and earn out payments related to our acquisition in touchdown because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of cash payments 
as of october   we had total unrecognized tax benefits of million  of which million is reflected in other long term liabilities  with the remaining million affecting goodwill if recognized 
operating and capital leases 
commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property 
we have entered into long term lease arrangements for our corporate headquarters in singapore  our principal us facility in cupertino  california  and our boeblingen  germany facility 
we have also entered into long term lease arrangements for our asic development office in colorado  as well as other sales and support facilities around the world 
as part of our acquisition of touchdown  we assumed certain capital lease obligations primarily for machinery and equipment 
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and  historically  we have used several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel  reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
therefore  only approximately of our purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable and unconditional commitments 
we expect to fulfill the purchase commitments for inventory within one year 
in addition  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts 
such liabilities were million as of october   and million as of october  these amounts are included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at october  and october  other purchase commitments 
other purchase commitments relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers  which include third party consultants for legal  finance  engineering and other administrative services 
with the exception of our it service providers  our purchase commitments from professional service providers are typically cancelable with a notice of days or less without significant penalties 
the agreement with our primary it service provider requires notice of days and includes a termination charge of up to approximately million in order to cancel our long term contract 
convertible senior notes 
on july   we issued million of convertible senior notes 
the notes will mature on july   and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the interest is payable semi annually on january th and july th of each year and payments commence on january  
table of contents long term liabilities 
long term liabilities relate primarily to million of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement obligations  million of extended warranty and deferred revenue obligations  a million deferred acquisition credit related to the touchdown technologies acquisition 
upon our separation from agilent  the defined benefit plans for our employees located in germany  korea  taiwan  france and italy were transferred to us 
with the exception of italy and france  which involve relatively insignificant amounts  agilent completed the funding of these transferred plans  based on of the accumulated benefit obligation level as of the separation date 
we made approximately million of contributions to the retirement plans for both periods presented 
we expect expenses of approximately million in fiscal year for the retirement plans  and we plan on making cash contributions of approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we conduct business on a global basis in a number of major international currencies 
as such  we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars except for certain of our revenues that are denominated in japanese yen 
services and support sales are denominated primarily in local currency after the initial product sale 
a significant amount of expenses are denominated in euro for certain expenses such as employee payroll and benefits as well as other expenses that are paid in local currency 
in addition  other expenses related to our non us and non european offices are denominated in the countries local currency 
as such  we enter into cash flow and balance sheet hedges to mitigate our foreign currency risk 
we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on euro denominated cash flows  where the us dollar is the functional currency  and japanese yen denominated cash flows and forecasted japanese yen denominated revenue 
we currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation 
we have implemented a cash flow hedging strategy that is intended to mitigate our currency exposures by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that have maturities in excess of one month 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues  costs and eventual cash flows 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the foreign exchange gain loss being reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity and later reclassified into the statement of operations as part of income from operations when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
if the underlying foreign currency requirement being hedged fails to occur  or if a portion of any derivative is deemed to be ineffective  we will recognize the gain loss on the associated financial instrument in operating income in the statement of operations 
as of october   the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges is approximately million 
this amount is included within current assets and the related gain of million net of tax of million is included within unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
these contracts are generally for a period of days or less and settled by the end of the month 
the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of interest income and other and offsets the change in fair value of the remeasured assets and liabilities 

table of contents we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and october   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
investment and interest rate risk we account for our investment instruments in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us all of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale 
our marketable securities include commercial paper  corporate bonds  government securities  and money market funds which we believe will be redeemed within one year and auction rate securities 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because we classify our debt securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
should interest rates fluctuate by percent  the value of our marketable securities would not have a significant impact as of october   and our interest income would have changed by approximately million for fiscal year auction rate securities are securities that are structured with interest rate reset periods of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of years

the fair value of the convertible notes will generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of the convertible notes will generally increase as our share price increases and decreases as the share price declines 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our convertible notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the our debt
