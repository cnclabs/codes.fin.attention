our business is subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion and the discussion in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
overview we manufacture  market and distribute charles colvard created moissanite jewels also called moissanite for sale in the worldwide jewelry market 
moissanite  also known by its chemical name  silicon carbide sic  is a rare  naturally occurring mineral found primarily in meteors 
as the sole manufacturer of scientifically made moissanite jewels  our strategy is to establish charles colvard as a 
table of contents reputable  high quality and sophisticated brand and position moissanite as a unique jewel  distinct from all others based on its exceptional fire  brilliance  luster  durability and rarity 
moissanite has primarily been marketed to the self purchasing woman as the perfect reward or indulgence for a woman celebrating her achievements or milestones in her life 
beginning in and continuing in to  charles colvard has expanded its marketing message beyond the self purchasing woman to include a larger marketplace such as  bridal  anniversary and gift giving 
moissanite is also marketed to the jewelry trade as a new jewelry category with a unique business opportunity 
sales for were less than sales during primarily due to the actions by us retailers to reduce their current inventory levels due to the challenging us economic environment 
there has been a pullback in consumer spending that has affected the jewelry industry more severely than most consumer products 
also negatively impacting revenue during was the termination of our manufacturing agreements with k g creations k g and reeves park  inc reeves park 
we terminated our relationship with k g effective january  and worked during to transition several retailers to new moissanite jewelry manufacturing customers of the company to replace the jewelry previously supplied by k g 
this transition was substantially completed in the second half of and we began to see new order flow late in from those retailers that continued in the moissanite jewelry business 
our manufacturing agreement with reeves park was terminated during the fourth quarter of due to repeated failure by reeves park to make timely payments on their open receivables 
we are currently in the process of reviewing the retail accounts supplied by reeves park in an attempt to ensure these retailers can still purchase moissanite jewelry 
net loss for was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of  or per diluted share  for included in the net loss for were all items are net of income tax million as a bad debt allowance against two specific customers  million related to severance costs  million related to closure of our operations in hong kong and china  and million related to the increased reserves on jewelry inventory and consigned inventory 
the total of these losses was million  net of income tax 
also included in the net loss was of million of additional income tax expense due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain united states deferred tax assets 
the allowance was established due to the company s net loss and uncertainty over whether the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to fully use the company s net operating loss carry forward and other deferred tax assets 
at our annual meeting of shareholders on may   the composition of our board of directors changed significantly with the election of three new members richard a 
bird  george r 
cattermole and ollin b 
sykes

table of contents other initiatives undertaken to improve our financial condition were to negotiate with our two leading raw material suppliers to defer purchases during the three months ended december  into  while keeping in place our long term supply agreements  close our operations in hong kong and china  and to reduce the size of our workforce 
in addition to the personnel changes discussed above  the organizational structure of the company has been streamlined through the elimination of other positions within the organization 
during  the company expensed approximately  in severance pay 
additionally  the management team and certain other employees agreed to a rollback in salary for the three months ended december  the organizational changes will result in salary savings of approximately million in  net of the  in base payments to be made to bcg and other severance and consulting fees 
due to the difficult economic environment  our first priorities are to generate positive cash flow and to stabilize the company s financial position through cost cutting initiatives and selling down our inventory by increasing sales with new and current customers 
as discussed above  we have already taken some significant steps to reduce costs 
we believe that we can improve the company s financial performance by executing a more selective and cost effective marketing strategy 
results of operations the following table shows certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of sales for the periods presented 
a detailed explanation of our results of operations follows this table year ended december  net sales gross profit marketing sales expenses general administrative expenses operating income net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
shipments of moissanite jewels  excluding consigned jewels  decreased to approximately  carats from  carats  while the average selling price per carat increased by 
us sales accounted for approximately and of sales during the year ended december  and  respectively 
us net sales and carat shipments  excluding consigned jewels  decreased by and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  us sales decreased primarily due to the actions by us retailers to reduce their current inventory levels due to the challenging us economic environment 
there has been a pullback in consumer spending that has negatively affected the jewelry industry 
also negatively impacting revenue during was the termination of our manufacturing agreements with k g creations k g and reeves park  inc reeves park 
we terminated our relationship with k g creations effective january  and worked during to transition several retailers to new moissanite jewelry manufacturing customers of the company to replace the jewelry previously supplied by k g 
that transition was substantially completed in the second half of and we began to see new order flow late in from those retailers that continued in the moissanite jewelry business 
during  we did not have any sales to k g and they accounted for of our sales during our manufacturing agreement with reeves park was terminated during the fourth quarter of due to repeated failure by reeves park to make timely payments on their open receivables 
we are currently in the process of reviewing the retail accounts supplied by reeves park in an attempt to ensure these retailers can still purchase moissanite jewelry 
as these former retailers of reeves park transition to new manufacturers  we will likely see a short term negative impact on our results of operations 
reeves park accounted for of our sales 
table of contents compared to of our sales 
another factor impacting sales in was the lack of significant sales related to sell in for retail stores that did not previously offer moissanite jewelry compared to approximately million of sales for sell in during our four largest customers during the year ended december  accounted for   and  respectively  of our sales compared to   and  respectively  for we expect that we will remain dependent on our ability and that of our largest customers to maintain and enhance their retail programs 
a change in or loss of any of these customer or retailer relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
international net sales and carat shipments decreased by and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to international sales decreased primarily due to decreased sales to thailand  the united kingdom  and taiwan  partially offset by higher sales to hong kong china and india 
a portion of our international sales is due to jewels sold internationally that will be re imported to north american retailers 
our top three international distributors during the year ended december  were located in italy  hong kong china and india 
in august  the company closed its hong kong and china operations 
the company will continue to pursue its opportunities in asia from the company s united states office and all customers that had been serviced from the hong kong office have been transitioned to the company s united states office 
our gross profit margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decreased gross profit margin percentage was primarily caused by higher production costs in the first in  first out accounting period relieved from inventory  the write off of a portion of the consigned jewels returned to us by k g in a damaged condition and an increase in the reserve on jewelry inventory  partially offset by an increase in our average selling price per carat 
the k g write off resulted in approximately a point reduction in our gross profit percentage during the year ended december  we increased our reserve on jewelry inventory by  during the year ended december  this reserve marks down our jewelry inventory to the value we believe we would obtain by melting the gold in the jewelry and putting the jewels that meet our grading criteria back into loose jewel inventory 
marketing and sales expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses were in both periods 
the primary reasons for the decrease in expenses were a  decrease in advertising expenses and  of decreased travel costs  partially offset by  of severance costs 
our direct advertising costs decreased by  primarily as a result of decreased print advertising while our co op advertising expense decreased by  due to lower sales 
our co op advertising program reimburses a portion of our customers marketing costs based on the amount of their purchases from us  and is subject to the customer providing us documentation of all advertising that includes our products 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  an increase of  or 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased to from in the same period of the increase in expenses is primarily due to a  increase in bad debt expense   of increased legal fees  and  of severance costs 
bad debt expense during totaled  reflecting an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts of million for reeves park and million for k g 
the increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts reduced the net value of receivables remaining from reeves park to approximately million 
this was based on the estimated net realizable value of the transactions resulting from the settlement agreement reached with reeves park in january the increase in the allowance attributable to k g will fully reserve the outstanding balance due from k g due to the uncertain nature of litigation 
we filed a lawsuit against k g in june to collect approximately million with interest accruing at the contract rate of from july  for jewels sold to k g 
bad debt expense during totaled  primarily due to an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts of million for k g and million for reeves park 
higher legal fees during compared to were the result of litigation costs for the south 
table of contents korean patent and k g lawsuits  as well as for the significant corporate changes undertaken by the company during based on successful court decisions on the south korean patent suit in and early in  we had capitalized  of legal fees as an intangible asset 
however  based on the negative decision received in december in this matter  we then expensed in the remaining unamortized value of  interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease resulted from a lower interest rate earned on our cash balances and lower cash balances 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  our statutory tax rate is and consists of the federal income tax rate of and the north carolina state income tax rate of  net of the federal benefit 
during  we established a valuation allowance of million against certain united states deferred tax assets due to the company s net loss and uncertainty over sufficient future taxable income to fully use the company s net operating loss carry forward and other deferred tax assets 
without the charges associated with the establishment of this valuation allowance  our effective income tax rate for would have been 
in  when we had taxable income  our effective income tax rate was higher than our statutory rate primarily due to our inability to recognize an income tax benefit for our operating losses in hong kong and china 
we did not recognize the income tax benefit of our losses in hong kong and china due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient future taxable income in those tax jurisdictions to offset the existing losses 
as a result of our loss position in the us during  the effect of losses at our non us operations caused our effective tax rate to be lower when compared to the effective tax rate in when we had taxable income 
another factor impacting our effective tax rate is the company s adoption of fin on january  under the provisions of fin  we recorded  of additional income tax expense during  increasing our effective tax rate by 
during  we recorded  of income tax expense under the provisions of fin  excluding the fin impact of a tax deduction due to the closing of operations in hong kong and china 
as a result of this tax deduction  we will receive an income tax benefit of  however this benefit is not reflected in our income tax expense as the deduction is being treated as an uncertain tax position under the provisions of fin liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million of cash and equivalents and million of working capital as compared to million of cash and equivalents and million of working capital at december  as further described below  cash and equivalents decreased during the year ended december  primarily as a result of million of cash used in operations 
the decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to the classification of inventory between current and long term assets  the decreases in accounts receivable and cash  partially offset by increased income taxes receivable and decreased accounts payable 
the company increased the long term portion of inventory due to decreasing sales and the uncertain economic environment over the next twelve months 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash expected to be generated by operations in future periods 
during the year ended december   million of cash was used in operations primarily as a result of our operating loss and a million decrease in accounts payable  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable excluding the impact of the change in reserves 
our decrease in accounts payable is primarily due to the reduction in expenses and inventory purchase commitments consistent with our efforts to reduce costs and inventory while conserving cash 
we significantly reduced our raw material inventory purchase commitments in over prior years to improve cash flow from operations 
further  we were able to negotiate with our two leading raw material suppliers to defer purchases during the three months ended december  into  while keeping in place our long term supply agreements 
we expect our reduced and deferred purchase commitments to help us convert inventory into cash at a faster rate 
we purchased million of raw material during 
table of contents compared to million of raw material in our raw material inventories of sic crystals are purchased under exclusive supply agreements with a limited number of suppliers 
because the supply agreements restrict the sale of these crystals to only us  the suppliers negotiate minimum purchase commitments with us that have resulted in levels of inventories that are higher than we might otherwise maintain 
these agreements  coupled with lower than expected sales  resulted in million of our inventories being classified as long term assets at december  on june   we entered into an amended and restated exclusive supply agreement with cree 
the exclusive supply agreement had an initial term of ten years that was extended in january to july in connection with the exclusive supply agreement  we have committed to purchase a minimum of by dollar volume of our requirements for sic crystals from cree 
if our orders require cree to expand beyond specified production levels  we must commit to purchase certain minimum quantities 
we purchased  of sic crystals from cree during the year ended december  in september  the company amended and supplemented its letter agreement with cree to suspend the company s commitment to purchase  of silicon carbide inventory from cree during the fourth quarter of this purchase commitment will be included in the company s yet to be established purchase commitment with cree 
in february  we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with norstel ab norstel for the supply of sic crystals for use in the manufacturing of moissanite jewels 
in april  we entered into an amendment to the exclusive supply agreement with norstel due to an update of norstel s delivery schedule and also due to our desire to limit our purchase of raw materials 
under the amendment  the company s minimum purchase commitment from norstel continues until i the company has purchased an aggregate amount of approximately million of sic crystals  or ii september   whichever occurs first 
we purchased  of sic crystals from norstel during the year ended december  and  since inception of the exclusive supply agreement 
in october  the company entered into a new letter agreement with norstel which amended and supplemented the april amendment 
pursuant to the new letter agreement  the company s commitment to purchase approximately  of silicon carbide inventory from norstel during the fourth quarter of was suspended and the company will resume purchasing from norstel in it is not yet determined what the company s total commitment from norstel will be for  although we have committed to purchase a minimum of of our quarterly sic requirements from norstel 
in addition  we advanced  to norstel in for the purchase of certain equipment 
this advance  which is in the form of a note receivable  began to be repaid in january through a reduction on the invoice for subsequent purchases of sic crystals 
effective march   pursuant to the april amendment  we began receiving a reduction on the invoice for subsequent purchases of sic crystals from norstel  and will continue to receive this reduction until the advance is repaid 
the balance on the advance as of december  was  due to the suspension of purchases with norstel  the company classified  of this note receivable as long term on the company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of december  in december  we entered into a research and development agreement that requires us to pay  per month for six months beginning in january as of december   we had trade accounts receivable from reeves park of million  or of receivables not considering our allowances for uncollectible accounts or returns 
as of december   trade accounts receivable from reeves park was million  or of our receivables not considering our allowances for uncollectible accounts or returns 
in march  we signed a manufacturing agreement with reeves park that allowed reeves park to continue receiving orders from us as long as it paid a specified amount higher than the amount of its new orders 
there was also a minimum payment amount to be made quarterly and monthly interest payments that reeves park was required to pay 
in september  reeves park stopped making payments required under the march agreement 
in october  we amended the march manufacturing agreement with reeves park and agreed to continue shipping orders on a prepaid basis if reeves park paid for all billings on items sold from consignment as they came due 
we entered into the amendment to ensure a flow of 
table of contents jewelry to retailers during the holiday season while we continued to pursue collection of the outstanding balance due from reeves park 
the amendment also provided reeves park with the required notice of good cause to terminate the manufacturing agreement due to reeves park s failure to make contractual payments on their outstanding balance 
in november  both the manufacturing agreement and the amendment with reeves park were terminated due to reeves park s repeated failure to make timely payments for moissanite shipped to reeves park 
in january  we entered into a settlement agreement with reeves park to settle the outstanding balance by accepting a return of inventory  the receipt of certain cash payments due to reeves park from its customers  and the payment of a settlement fee to the company by reeves park 
based on the million estimated net realizable value of the transactions under the settlement agreement  the company increased its allowance for uncollectible accounts during for reeves park to million 
the majority of the jewelry received is valued at scrap value due to the lack of a plan to market this inventory 
the inventory received from this transaction will be received in early and is not reflected on our balance sheet as of december  on february   we entered into the management services agreement the agreement with bird capital group  inc bcg under which bcg will provide management services to the company  including the services of richard a 
bird  a current director of the company  as the company s full time non employee chief executive officer 
the services to be provided by bcg include the development of a new strategy of the company for growth and competitive success 
the initial term of the agreement is scheduled to end on december  after the initial term  the agreement would automatically renew for three successive one year terms unless terminated by the company within days of the receipt of audited year end financial statements if the company has not met certain annual sales and operating income thresholds 
the agreement is terminable for cause as defined in the agreement or upon the death or incapacitation of mr 
bird 
bcg also may terminate the agreement if there is a change of control as defined in the agreement of the company at any time prior to february  upon such termination  bcg would receive all money and bonuses due under the agreement plus an early termination payment equal to  if the change of control occurs before february  and  if the change of control occurs on or after february   provided that the early termination payment for a change of control on or after february  would be payable only if the annual sales or operating income threshold referred to above is met for the calendar year immediately preceding the change of control 
the agreement provides for monthly management fees payable to bcg 
bcg will receive  per month during  except the monthly fee will be  per month during the first two months of the agreement to compensate bcg for the additional work with respect to the new strategy 
beginning on january  and on january of each succeeding year of the agreement  the fee will be subject to certain adjustments 
the agreement also provides for potential short and long term bonuses payable to bcg 
bcg would receive a one time bonus equal to of any realized gross profit  with certain exceptions  that is collected in cash from the reduction of finished goods inventory as of january  compared to january  in addition  bcg would receive a possible bonus based on any net amounts realized upon any settlement of certain pending litigation 
long term bonuses potentially payable to bcg include an annual bonus equal to of the company s operating income before or excluding i interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  ii charges or accruals for long term bonuses payable to bcg and  iii certain extraordinary and nonrecurring items 
upon the earlier of any sale transaction as defined in the agreement of the company or termination of the agreement  bcg also will receive a one time bonus equal to of the amount by which the company s total market valuation exceeds the company s market valuation on the date of the agreement 
the company s market valuation is determined based on the sale transaction or the market price of the company s common stock  as applicable 
we did not make any income tax payments during the year ended december  due to our loss position 
as of december  we have an income tax receivable in the amount of  and we expect to receive these funds in the middle of included on our tax return is a significant tax deduction related to the closing of operations at our hong kong subsidiary 
we have treated this deduction as an uncertain tax position under the provisions of fin  resulting in no income tax benefit on our statement of operations for this deduction 

table of contents our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the risk factors described in greater detail under item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
based on our cash and equivalents and other working capital  management believes that our existing capital resources are adequate to satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next months provided that there are no extraordinary events and that economic conditions impacting consumer spending do not further deteriorate and adversely affect the demand for moissanite 
as discussed above  during we have taken certain actions to reduce costs and to increase our cash flow from operations 
specifically  these actions include the closing of our operations in hong kong and china negotiating lower purchase commitments for raw materials inventory and reducing staffing levels 
the company also entered into the management services agreement the agreement with bird capital group  inc bcg under which bcg will provide management services to the company  including the services of richard a 
bird as the company s full time non employee chief executive officer 
the services to be provided by bcg include the development of a new strategy of the company for growth and competitive success 
one of the primary objectives of this plan will be to establish methods to allow the company to reduce inventory levels through increased sales 
management believes that the company will be able to satisfy its sales requirements without any additional purchases of raw material inventory 
we will continue our efforts to increase financial flexibility during this difficult economic environment 
there can be no assurance that the efforts taken to date and future actions will be able to withstand the impact of any economic downturn that extends deeper or longer than we currently anticipate 
under these conditions  our operations and other sources of funds may not be sufficient to fund our operations  and we may be required to seek alternative sources of funding 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms  or at all  especially in light of the ongoing turmoil in the financial markets described in greater detail under item a  risk factors of this annual report on form k 
net operating loss carryforward due to the carry back of our taxable loss against taxes paid in prior years  we have million of remaining federal income tax credits that can be carried forward to offset future income 
these credits begin expiring in at december   the company has a north carolina tax nol carryforward of approximately million that begins to expire in this nol can be used to offset future state taxable income 
during  we established a valuation allowance of million against certain united states deferred tax assets due to the company s net loss and uncertainty over sufficient future taxable income to fully use the company s net operating loss carry forward and other deferred tax assets 
as of december   there was approximately million in nol carryforwards in hong kong 
in accordance with the hong kong tax code these amounts can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income in hong kong 
due to the closing of operations at our hong kong office  we do not expect to utilize any of the hong kong nol carryforward available to us 
as of december   there was approximately  in nol carryforwards in china 
in accordance with the china tax code these amounts can be carried forward five years to offset future taxable income in china 
the nol carryforwards began expiring in we will not utilize this carry forward due to the closing of operations in china during 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant estimates impacting our consolidated financial statements relate to valuation and classification of inventories  accounts receivable reserves  deferred tax assets  uncertain tax positions and co op advertising 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  the most significant of which is our policy for revenue recognition  however  this policy typically does not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
our finished goods inventory consists primarily of near colorless moissanite jewels that meet rigorous grading criteria and are of cuts and sizes most commonly used in the jewelry industry 
any inventory in excess of the company s current requirements based on anticipated levels of sales is classified as long term on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
our classification of long term inventory requires us to estimate the portion of inventory that can be realized over the next months 
as of december   we carry only a limited amount of moissanite jewels in finished jewelry settings 
our inventories do not degrade in quality over time and are not subject to fashion trends 
moissanite jewel properties do not change over time 
we have very small market penetration in the worldwide jewelry market and the company has the exclusive right through to produce and sell lab created silicon carbide sic for use in jewelry applications 
in view of the foregoing factors  we have concluded that no excess or obsolete inventory reserve requirements exist as of december  during  we established a lower of cost or market reserve of  to allow for a portion of the finished goods inventory to be re cut 
there are certain jewels in inventory that can be re cut to achieve higher quality standards 
to determine this reserve  we estimated the amount of inventory that is anticipated to be re cut and the amount of weight loss that will occur during the process 
since the establishment of this reserve  we have not yet re cut any jewels 
at december   the reserve remained at  estimates are used to determine the amount of two reserves against accounts receivable 
the first reserve is an allowance for returns 
at the time revenue is recognized  we estimate future returns and reduce sales and accounts receivable by this estimated amount 
this amount is estimated using the historical return rate for our company and considers any contractual return privileges granted to customers 
the allowance for returns was  and  at december  and  respectively 
second  an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reduce accounts receivable to an amount expected to be collected 
based on our collection history  we determine a percentage based on the age of the receivable that we deem uncollectible 
the allowance is then calculated by applying the appropriate percentage to each of our receivables 
any increases or decreases to this allowance are charged or credited to general and administrative expenses 
any accounts with significant balances are reviewed separately to determine an appropriate allowance based on the facts and circumstances of the specific account 
during our review for  we specifically reviewed and recorded an allowance for the balances owed to us by reeves park and k g creations 
the total allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  attributable to reeves park was  and the portion attributable to k g creations was  we had to make significant estimates on the net realizable value of the transactions resulting from our january settlement agreement with reeves park to determine the appropriate allowance  including the portion of the jewelry inventory that is saleable and the scrap value for the remaining portion of the inventory received 
the reserve for k g reduced the value of the receivable on the books to zero due to the uncertainty of litigation 
accounting rules require that all deferred tax assets of the company be assessed to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
a valuation allowance is required if it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the 
table of contents accounting rules state further that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
based on our large losses during and the lack of verifiable positive evidence of sufficient future taxable income to fully use the company s net operating loss carry forward and other deferred tax assets  we established a valuation allowance during of million against certain united states deferred tax assets 
this assessment will continue to be addressed in all future periods 
all of our deferred tax assets in hong kong and china are fully reserved with a valuation allowance and have been fully reserved in all prior periods due to uncertainty of future taxable income in these jurisdictions to utilize the deferred tax assets 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin fin provides guidance on the de recognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
during  the company closed the operations of its hong kong subsidiary 
as a result  we will have a significant tax deduction on our tax return resulting from unpaid obligations of the subsidiary to the company 
we have determined that this deduction qualifies as an uncertain tax position under the provisions of fin while we did take this deduction on our tax return and reflect the effect of this deduction in our income tax receivable and deferred tax assets  we also recorded a long term accrued income tax liability of million due to the transaction 
this liability will be resolved when we get an official ruling from the irs on the deduction or when the statute of limitations expires 
if the deduction is resolved in a favorable manner  we will reverse all or some of this liability and credit income tax expense for the same amount 
we offer a co op advertising program to many of our customers that reimburses a portion of their marketing costs based on their net purchases from us 
at the end of any given period  we estimate the amount of co op advertising expense that has not yet been submitted for credit by our customers 
these amounts were  and  at december  and  respectively 
we estimate this amount based on our historical experience with each customer  and the related contractual arrangements to provide certain levels of co op advertising for our customers 
revenue is recognized when products are shipped  excluding memo or consignment shipments as discussed below 
our standard payment terms are generally between and days for jewel distributors and generally between to days for jewelry manufacturers 
some customers are required to prepay prior to shipment 
for all jewels shipped  title passes upon shipment of the jewels from our facility ie  fob shipping point 
periodically  the company sells jewels to customers on memo terms 
for shipments on memo terms  the customer assumes the risk of loss and has an absolute right of return for a specified period 
our customers are generally required to make payments on memo shipments within days upon the customer informing the company that they will keep the jewels 
accordingly  the company does not recognize revenue on these memo transactions until the earlier of the customer informing the company that they will keep the jewels or the expiration of the right of return period 
all memo shipments are shown on our balance sheets as inventory on consignment
