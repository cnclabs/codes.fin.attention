other businesses white label and hosting businesses we license our technology and business services to third party partners and offer them access to our travel content through our white label business 
using our technology platform  these partners are able to operate websites under their own brands 
our white label business helps power the dynamic package products available on websites such as yahoo and msn 
com  as well as a number of airline and hotel websites 
we earn revenue from our white label business through revenue sharing arrangements for the travel booked on these third party websites 
we also host and manage websites on behalf of third party partners through our hosting products 
we manage portions of american airlines and northwest airlines websites 
we earn revenue from our hosting business through license or fee arrangements 
partner marketing through our partner marketing programs  we generate advertising revenue by providing our partners direct access to our customer base through a combination of display advertising  performance based advertising and other marketing programs 
our advertising partners include travel companies  convention and visitor bureaus  credit card partners  media  packaged goods and other non travel advertisers 

table of contents retail and merchant models retail model our retail model provides customers the ability to book air  hotel  cruise and car rental reservations 
air transactions comprise the majority of this business 
through our retail model  we earn commissions from suppliers for airline tickets  hotel rooms  car rentals and other travel products and services booked on our websites 
we also charge our customers a service fee for booking the travel reservation 
generally  our net revenue per transaction is lower under the retail model compared to the merchant model described below 
however  due to the high volume of air reservations booked under the retail model  it contributes substantially to our overall gross bookings and net revenue 
we recognize net revenue under the retail model when the reservation is made  secured by a customer with a credit card and when there are no further obligations on our part to perform 
in this model  we do not take on credit risk with travelers  we are not the primary obligor with the customer  we have no latitude in determining pricing  we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and we have no discretion in the selection of the service supplier 
merchant model our merchant model primarily provides customers the ability to book air  hotel  destination services reservations and dynamic vacation packages 
hotel transactions comprise the majority of this business 
through our merchant model  we provide customers the ability to book the travel reservation  and we contract with various suppliers that provide the travel products needed to fulfill the reservation 
we generate revenue for our services based on the difference between the total amount the customer pays for the travel product and the negotiated net rate plus estimated taxes that the supplier charges us for that product 
we also charge our customers a service fee for booking the travel reservation 
generally  our net revenue per transaction is higher under the merchant model compared to the retail model due to our negotiation of net rates with suppliers 
customers generally pay us for reservations at the time of booking  which is in advance of their travel 
we pay our suppliers at some later date  which is generally after the customer uses the reservation 
initially  we record these customer receipts as deferred income and accrued merchant payables 
we recognize net revenue when customers use the reservation  and we pay our suppliers once we have received an invoice  which generally ranges from one to sixty days after customers use the reservation 
the timing difference between the cash collected from our customers and payments to our suppliers impacts our operating cash flows and represents a source of liquidity for us 
in this model  we do not take on credit risk with travelers  however we are subject to fraud risk  we have the ability to determine the price  we are not responsible for the actual delivery of the flight  hotel room  or car rental  we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and the customer is responsible for the selection of the service supplier 
when customers assemble a dynamic vacation package  we may offer the customer the ability to book a mix of travel products that use both the retail model and the merchant model 
the use of products under the merchant model allows us to make certain products available to our customers at prices that are generally lower than booking each travel product separately 
our net revenue per transaction is generally higher for dynamic vacation packages than for stand alone travel products 
supplier relationships and global distribution systems supplier relationships we have teams that manage relationships and negotiate agreements with our suppliers 
these agreements generally cover access to the supplier s travel inventory as well as payment for our services 
our teams cover air  hotel  car rental  cruise  travel insurance and destination services suppliers 
our teams focus on relationship management  supplier sponsored promotions and contract negotiations covering our retail  merchant and corporate businesses 

table of contents the global hotel supply team is responsible for negotiating agreements that provide us access to the inventory of independent hotels  chains and hotel management companies 
as part of our efforts to grow our dynamic packaging and hotel net revenue  we have significantly increased the number of hotel market managers on our global hotel supply team  particularly in europe and asia pacific 
with these additional resources in place  we have signed a substantial number of new direct hotel contracts  and we anticipate realizing the benefits of these direct relationships 
global distribution systems global distribution systems gdss provide us access to a comprehensive set of supplier content through a single source 
suppliers  such as airlines and hotels  utilize gdss to connect their product and service offerings with travel providers  who in turn make these products and services available to travelers for booking 
certain of our businesses utilize gds services provided by galileo  worldspan and amadeus 
under gds service agreements  we receive revenue in the form of an incentive payment for each segment that is processed through a gds 
galileo and worldspan are subsidiaries of travelport  and we have an agreement with travelport that covers the gds services provided by both galileo and worldspan 
this agreement contains volume requirements for the number of segments that we must process through galileo and worldspan and requires us to make shortfall payments if we do not process the required minimum number of segments for a given year 
as a result  a significant portion of our gds services are provided by travelport gdss 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of incentive revenue for segments processed through galileo and worldspan  which accounted for more than of our total net revenue 
operations and technology systems infrastructure and web and database servers we use savvis colocation services in the us to host our systems infrastructure and web and database servers for our orbitz  cheaptickets  the away network and orbitz for business brands as well as our ebookers brands 
the majority of our hardware and other equipment for operating our business is located at the savvis facility 
savvis provides data center management services as well as emergency hands on support 
in addition  we have our own dedicated staff on site at the facility 
if savvis was unable  for any reason  to support our primary web hosting facility  we have a secondary facility through verizon business  which is also located in the us we use british telecom services in the uk to host our systems infrastructure and web and database servers for ebookers legacy systems and for hotelclub and ratestogo 
the arrangement with british telecom is similar to the arrangement described above with savvis 
under a transition services agreement entered into at the time of our ipo  travelport also provides us colocation services in its data centers located in the us and us we are actively migrating from the travelport data centers to the savvis and british telecom data centers 
we anticipate completion of this migration by the end of the first quarter of  thus eliminating our dependency on travelport for these services see note related party transactions of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
systems platform our systems platform enables us to deconstruct the segment feeds from our gds partners for air flight searches and then reassemble these segments for cost effective and flexible multi leg itineraries 
we also have the ability to connect to and book air travel directly on certain airlines internal reservation systems through our supplier link technology 
our easy to use matrix display allows customers to simultaneously view these various travel options so that they can select the price and supplier that best meet their individual travel needs 
in addition  our dynamic packaging technology enables travelers to view multiple combinations of airlines  
table of contents hotels and other travel products and allows them to assemble a customized vacation package that is generally more flexible and less expensive than booking each travel product separately 
we are in the process of developing and implementing our new technology platform 
our new platform currently supports our brand portfolio in europe 
in  we launched the new platform for our ebookers brand in the uk and ireland  and in  we launched our remaining ebookers websites onto the platform 
we have technology operations teams dedicated to ensuring that our websites operate efficiently 
these teams monitor our websites as well as the performance and availability of our third party service providers 
in addition  they coordinate major releases of new functionality on our websites as well as the development and implementation of our new technology platform 
customer support our customer support platform includes orbitztlc  a proactive customer care service for our travelers 
our orbitztlc team is based in chicago  illinois  and monitors federal aviation administration  national weather service and other data to send customers real time updates on information that may affect their travel plans 
our customer support platform also includes call centers and customer service centers that utilize intelligent voice routing and intelligent call management technology to connect customers with the appropriate center to assist them with their particular needs 
we utilize a variety of third party vendors  domestically and internationally  to manage these call centers and customer service centers 
fraud system we have an internally developed fraud system that enables us to reduce our fraud rates and the costs associated with fraud detection and prosecution 
the system automates many of the manual functions of a fraud prevention agent while prioritizing suspicious transactions for review 
marketing we utilize a combination of online and traditional offline marketing 
our sales and marketing efforts primarily focus on increasing brand awareness and driving visitors to our websites 
our long term success will depend on our ability to continue to increase the overall number of booked transactions in a cost effective manner 
we use various forms of online marketing to drive traffic to our websites  including search engine marketing  display advertising  affiliate programs and email marketing 
we also generate traffic and transactions from certain meta search travel websites 
we are actively pursuing tactics to optimize the results of our online marketing efforts by increasing the value from existing traffic and by acquiring additional traffic that is more targeted and cost effective 
these tactics include pay per click optimization and search engine optimization initiatives  loyalty programs and email marketing that target customers with specific offers that correspond to their particular interests 
we also use traditional broadcast advertising to focus on brand differentiation and to emphasize certain distinct features of our businesses that we believe are valuable to our customers 
we also have a dedicated marketing team that focuses on generating leads and building relationships with corporate travel managers 
our sales team includes experienced corporate travel managers and is qualified to assist corporations in choosing between the variety of corporate booking products that are offered under our orbitz for business brand 
intellectual property we regard our technology and other intellectual property  including our brands  as a critical part of our business 
we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of copyright  trademark and patent laws and trade secret and confidentiality procedures 
we have a number of trademarks  service marks and trade names that are registered or for which we have pending registration applications or common law rights 
these include orbitz  orbitz matrix  flex search  orbitztlc  orbitztlc mobile access  the orbitz design 
table of contents and the stylized o 
we have four issued us patents 
two of these patents relate to a system and method for receiving and loading fare and schedule data that allows us to search for fares and book air segments 
these patents are scheduled to expire on november  and april   respectively 
the third patent relates to a method of searching for travel products from multiple suppliers and creating vacation packages 
this patent is scheduled to expire on april  the fourth patent relates to a method for gathering and analyzing data related to travel conditions and generating and sending a message explaining the travel conditions to one or more travelers 
this patent is scheduled to expire on may  in addition  we have pending patent applications in the us through these patent applications  we are seeking patent rights in several areas of our online travel services technology 
these areas include technology related to our process for searching using multiple data providers  our process for synchronizing passenger name and record data  our supplier link and related booking technology  our system for searching for itineraries based on flexible travel dates  and our deal detector functionality 
despite these efforts and precautions  we cannot be certain that any of these patent applications will result in issued patents  or that we will receive any effective protection from competition from any trademarks and issued patents 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization 
in that case  legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by unauthorized use 
further  others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 
from time to time  we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business  including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks  copyrights  patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
in addition  we may have to initiate lawsuits in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others 
any such litigation  regardless of outcome or merit  could consume a significant amount of financial resources or management time 
it could also invalidate or impair our intellectual rights  or result in significant damages or onerous license terms and restrictions for us 
we may even lose our right to use certain intellectual property or business processes 
these outcomes could materially harm our business 
see item  legal proceedings 
at the time of our ipo  we entered into a master license agreement with travelport  which gives travelport licenses to use certain of our intellectual property going forward  including our supplier link technology  portions of ebookers booking  search and dynamic packaging technologies  certain of our products and online booking tools for corporate travel  portions of our white label dynamic packaging technology  and our extranet supplier connectivity functionality currently being implemented as part of our new technology platform 
the master license agreement granted us the right to use a corporate online booking product that travelport was developing at the time we entered into the agreement 
the development of this product is now complete  and we have entered into a value added reseller license with travelport for this product 
the master license agreement generally includes the right to create derivative works and other improvements 
other than the unrestricted use of our supplier link technology  travelport is generally prohibited from sublicensing these technologies to any third party for competitive use 
however  travelport and its affiliates are not restricted from using the technologies to compete directly with us 
information about segments and geographic areas we operate and manage our business as a single operating segment

table of contents industry conditions general the worldwide travel industry is a large and dynamic industry that has been characterized by rapid and significant change 
the economic and industry outlook deteriorated significantly for the fourth quarter of and into  as the global economy is experiencing a prolonged recession 
the weakening economy has caused unemployment rates to rise and lowered consumer confidence which  in turn  has resulted in changes to consumer spending patterns  including reduced spending on discretionary items  such as travel 
this has resulted in reduced growth rates for both domestic and international online travel bookings 
we believe that the rate of growth of online travel bookings in the domestic market has also reduced due to the maturing of this market 
much of the initial rapid growth experienced in the online travel industry was driven by consumers shifting from purchasing travel through traditional offline channels to purchasing travel through online channels 
accordingly  we believe that growth rates in the domestic online travel market may more closely follow the growth rates of the overall travel industry 
internationally  the online travel industry continues to benefit from rapidly increasing internet usage and growing acceptance of online booking 
we expect international growth rates for the online travel industry to continue to outpace growth rates of the overall travel industry 
as a result  we believe there are opportunities for online travel companies otcs to generate a larger percentage of their growth from outside of the us however  competitive pressures combined with the weakening global economy have reduced and may continue to reduce international growth rates 
competition the general market for travel products and services is intensely competitive 
in the online travel industry  certain competitors  such as travel research and meta search companies  face low barriers of entry and can launch new websites at a relatively low cost 
numerous internet companies greatly influence the competitive environment as well 
search and meta search sites are capable of sending customers to the websites of suppliers and our direct competitors 
search engines include websites such as aol  google  msn and yahoo  while meta search sites primarily include farecast  kayak  sidestep and yahoo farechase 
our current competitors include online travel companies  traditional offline leisure travel companies  suppliers and travel research companies 
in addition  we compete internationally with smaller regional operators 
the companies that we compete with include the following among online travel companies  our major competitors primarily include expedia 
com  hotels 
com  hotwire 
com and venere 
com  which are owned by expedia  inc  travelocity 
com and lastminute 
com  which are owned by sabre holdings corporation  and priceline 
com and bookings 
com  which are owned by priceline 
com incorporated 
in the offline travel company category  our largest competitors include companies such as liberty travel  inc  american express travel related services company  inc  thomas cook and tui travel 
we compete with suppliers  such as airlines  hotel and rental car companies  many of which have their own branded websites and toll free numbers through which they generate business 
we also compete with travel research companies such as trip advisor and travelzoo 
travel research companies offer social networks on their websites through which consumers can access content such as user generated travel reviews 
travel research companies are also capable of sending customers to the websites of suppliers and our direct competitors 
suppliers have been steadily focusing on increasing distribution of their services through their own websites in lieu of using third parties like us 
suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a booking or service fee  and  in some instances  offer advantages such as their own bonus miles or loyalty points  which may make their offerings more attractive than our offerings to some consumers 

table of contents factors affecting our competitive success include price  availability of travel products  ability to package travel products across multiple suppliers  brand recognition  customer service and customer care  fees charged to travelers  ease of use  accessibility and reliability 
seasonality our businesses experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
the majority of our customers book travel for leisure purposes rather than for business 
gross bookings for leisure travel are generally highest in the first and second calendar quarters as customers plan and book their spring and summer vacations 
however  net revenue generated under the merchant model is generally recognized when the travel takes place and typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer 
as a result  our cash receipts are generally highest in the first and second calendar quarters and our net revenue is typically highest in the second and third calendar quarters 
our seasonality may also be affected by fluctuations in the travel products our suppliers make available to us for booking  the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix 
company strategy economic and industry conditions significantly impacted our performance during the fourth quarter of and have created uncertainty for the entire travel industry going forward into in light of this uncertainty  we are currently re evaluating our long term strategy 
in the short term  we are focused on improving our operating efficiency 
we believe we will be in a better position to manage through the current environment if we improve our operating efficiencies by making sustainable reductions in our cost structure 
we have already taken steps to reduce our cost structure 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we reduced our global workforce  our use of outside contractors and other operating costs 
we expect to realize approximately to million of annualized cash savings from these actions 
we also expect to realize operating efficiencies going forward as a result of implementing a common technology platform for our ebookers websites 
we believe this platform will improve our operating efficiencies through back office automation and by centralizing certain business functions such as customer service  fulfillment and accounting 
we may continue to take additional measures going forward to further reduce our cost structure  as deemed necessary 
simplifying the way we do business 
we are also focused on simplifying our business  primarily with respect to our technology 
we believe that if we simplify the code of our technology platform  we will be able to develop new functionality on our websites more efficiently and with fewer resources 
continuing to innovate 
we also believe that we can better manage through the current environment if we develop new  innovative functionality on our websites  such as orbitz price assurance 
at the same time  we are focused on reducing development timelines and costs 
we believe this short term strategy will better position us to manage through this challenging environment  until such time as economic and industry conditions improve and we redefine our long term strategy

item a 
risk factors 
our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted by the economic downturn and our level of indebtedness increases our sensitivity to this risk 
the global economy is experiencing a severe and prolonged recession as a result of the deterioration in the capital markets and related financial crisis 
both our customers and suppliers have felt the impact of this downturn 
for example  several us airlines have implemented capacity reductions and higher air fares in the face of slowing customer demand and are under increased pressure to reduce their overall distribution costs 
as a result  our suppliers could attempt to terminate or renegotiate their agreements with us on more favorable terms to them  which could reduce the revenue we generate from those agreements 
the weakness in the economy has also negatively impacted consumer spending patterns  including as it relates to the travel products offered on our websites 
if consumer demand for travel and the products offered on our websites continues to decrease  our revenues may decline 
if economic conditions do not improve  or worsen  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
in addition  a substantial or prolonged material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition could affect our ability to satisfy the financial covenants in our senior secured credit agreement  which could result in our having to seek amendments or waivers from our lenders to avoid the termination of commitments and or the acceleration of the maturity of amounts that are outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility 
the cost of our obtaining an amendment or waiver could be significant  and could substantially increase our cost of borrowing over the remaining term of our senior secured credit agreement 
further  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain an amendment or waiver 
if our lenders were unwilling to enter into an amendment or provide a waiver  all amounts outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility would become immediately due and payable 
our liquidity has been  and may continue to be  negatively impacted 
the weak and volatile conditions in the global financial markets and financial sector have caused a substantial deterioration in the capital markets which has diminished the availability of funds and increased the cost of raising capital 
in response  many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards and reduced  and in some cases ceased  funding borrowers 
we have already experienced the negative effects of this deterioration on our liquidity 
specifically  the bankruptcy filing by lehman commercial paper inc  which held a million commitment under our revolving credit facility  effectively reduced the total availability under our revolving credit facility from million to million 
if any of our other lenders are unable or unwilling to fund their respective commitments  and we are unable to replace these lenders  the amount available to us for borrowings and letters of credit under our revolving credit facility would be further reduced 
in the future  we may require more liquidity than is available to us under our revolving credit facility as a result of changes in our business model  changes to payment terms or other supplier imposed requirements  lower than anticipated operating cash flows or other unanticipated events  such as unfavorable outcomes in our legal proceedings 
for example  the liquidity provided by cash flows from our merchant model bookings could be negatively impacted if our suppliers  including credit card processors and hotels  changed their payment terms or imposed other requirements on us  such as requiring us to provide letters of credit or to establish cash reserves  or if our merchant model bookings declined as a result of current economic conditions or other factors 

table of contents if in the future  we require more liquidity than is available to us under our revolving credit facility  we cannot be certain that funding would be available to us at all or on attractive or acceptable terms 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to take advantage of potential business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and liquidity 
our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if the financial condition of one or more of our major suppliers  including airlines and car rental companies  deteriorates or restructures its operations 
in the past several years  several major us airlines have either filed for bankruptcy protection under the united states bankruptcy code  recently exited bankruptcy or discussed publicly the risks of bankruptcy 
in addition  the economic downturn has severely impacted the automobile industry  including car rental companies  as illustrated by the chapter bankruptcy filing by advantage rent a car in december we depend on a relatively small number of airlines for a significant portion of our net revenue 
in addition  although the net revenue we generate from car rental reservations is significantly smaller than our net revenue from air transactions  our car net revenues are derived from a relatively small number of car rental companies 
as a result of this dependence  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if the financial condition of one or more of the major airlines or car rental companies were to deteriorate or in the event of supplier consolidation in either of these industries 
potential bankruptcies and consolidation in our suppliers industries could result in capacity reductions and increased prices  which may in turn have a negative impact on demand for travel products 
the travel industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to effectively compete in the future 
we operate in the highly competitive travel industry 
our success depends  in large part  upon our ability to compete effectively against numerous competitors  including other online travel companies  meta search companies  travel research companies  suppliers and online internet companies  several of which have significantly greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we have 
factors affecting our competitive success include price  availability of travel products  ability to package travel products across multiple suppliers  brand recognition  customer service and customer care  service fees  ease of use  accessibility and reliability 
if we are not able to compete effectively against our competitors  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
in particular  our results of operations would be negatively impacted if competitive dynamics in the industry caused us to reduce or eliminate the service fees we charge our customers 
we charge a service fee on many of our websites  and in exchange  provide our customers the ability to book their travel reservation and access to various services  including our orbitztlc customer care platform and orbitz price assurance 
during  certain online travel companies reduced or eliminated booking fees on retail airline tickets and hotel rooms  which has created uncertainty around the sustainability of booking fees 
in addition  suppliers have increasingly focused on distributing their products through their own websites  which typically do not charge a booking or service fee  and search and meta search sites are growing in popularity and may drive more traffic directly to the websites of suppliers or competitors that charge lower or no fees 
although some of our primary competitors also charge booking or service fees  we believe our business and results of operations would be more adversely impacted  relative to certain of our competitors  if competitive dynamics caused us to reduce or eliminate these fees 
if  as a result of the limitations contained in our gds service agreement or otherwise  we are unable to implement certain changes to our business in an effort to absorb the impact of the reduction or elimination of these fees or are unable to increase revenue from other sources  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

table of contents our revenue is derived from the travel industry and a prolonged substantial decrease in travel volume  particularly air travel  as well as other industry trends  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenue is derived from the worldwide travel industry 
as a result  our revenue is directly related to the overall level of travel activity  particularly air travel volume  and is therefore significantly impacted by declines in or disruptions to travel in the us  europe and the asia pacific region  which are our key regions  due to factors entirely outside of our control 
these factors include general economic conditions  particularly the current economic downturn which has caused a decline in travel volume  global security issues  political instability  acts or threats of terrorism  hostilities or war and other political issues that could adversely affect travel volume in our key regions  epidemics or pandemics  natural disasters  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  the financial condition of suppliers  including the airline and hotel industry  and the impact of their financial condition on the cost and availability of air travel and hotel rooms  changes to regulations governing the airline and travel industry  fuel prices  work stoppages or labor unrest at any of the major airlines or airports  increased airport security that could reduce the convenience of air travel  travelers perceptions of the occurrence of travel related accidents or the scope  severity and timing of the other factors described above  and changes in occupancy and room rates achieved by hotels 
if there is a prolonged substantial decrease in travel volumes  particularly air travel and hotel stays  for these or any other reasons  it would have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we carry significant goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet  and if a future impairment were to occur based on a decline in our stock price  projected results of operations  cash flows from operations or otherwise  we may be required to record a significant charge against earnings 
during the year ended december   in response to changes in the economic environment and the prolonged decline in our market capitalization  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to our goodwill and million related to our indefinite lived intangible assets 
as of december   after giving effect to this impairment charge  we had goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets of  million  which represented approximately of our total consolidated assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets must be tested for impairment annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist 
factors that could indicate that our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired include a prolonged decline in our stock price and market capitalization  lower than projected operating results and cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry 
due to the current economic uncertainty and other factors  we cannot predict whether our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be further impaired in future periods or whether a significant charge against our earnings may be required  which could be higher than the charge recorded during fiscal year if we are required to record an impairment charge for our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the future  this would adversely impact our results of operations 

table of contents we have a significant amount of indebtedness  which could limit the manner in which we operate our business 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding debt under our senior secured credit agreement 
our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us  including the following it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  it requires us to use a portion of our cash flows from operations to make debt service payments  which reduces the funds available to us for other purposes such as potential acquisitions and capital expenditures  because we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors  it puts us at a competitive disadvantage and reduces our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in the economy or our industry  including increased competition  and it may make us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio  which declines over the term of the agreement 
if we fail to comply with these covenants and we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment  our lenders could accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility and could proceed against the collateral securing this indebtedness 
furthermore  if this were to occur  there is no assurance that alternative financing would be available to us at all or at favorable terms  particularly in the wake of the current economic environment 
in addition  restrictive covenants in our credit agreement specifically limit our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness or enter into guarantees  enter into sale or leaseback transactions  make new investments  loans or acquisitions  sell our assets  engage in mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
as a result  we may operate our business differently than if we were not subject to these covenants and restrictions 
we rely on travelport to issue letters of credit on our behalf under its credit facility 
as of december   approximately million of letters of credit were issued by travelport on our behalf 
under the terms of the separation agreement  as amended  travelport has agreed to continue to issue and renew letters of credit on our behalf through at least march  and thereafter so long as travelport and its affiliates as defined therein own at least of our voting stock 
although travelport is obligated to issue letters of credit on our behalf  this obligation is subject to certain conditions  including a million limitation on the aggregate amount of letters of credit that travelport is required to issue on our behalf at any given point in time 
if we do not have a separate letter of credit facility in place if or when travelport is no longer obligated to issue letters of credit on our behalf  or if we exceed the million limitation or if we require letters of credit denominated in foreign currencies  we would be required to issue letters of credit under our revolving credit facility  which could significantly reduce our borrowing capacity under our 
table of contents revolving credit facility 
if letters of credit were issued under our revolving credit facility  our ability to borrow amounts to fund our working capital and other needs could be severely limited 
certain of our international subsidiaries have a history of significant operating losses  and our inability to improve their scale and profitability could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have historically incurred significant operating losses at our european subsidiaries and may continue to experience operating losses in the future  particularly since we expect to continue to incur significant marketing and other expenses in order to grow our international business 
as a result  we have made  and may continue to make  significant investments in their operations by using a portion of the cash flow generated from our domestic operations or making additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
there can be no assurance that our european subsidiaries will be profitable in the future or that any profits generated by them will be sufficient to recover our investment in them 
the profitability of our european business depends to a large extent on the scale of its operation 
if we fail to achieve the desired scale  we may not be able to effectively compete in the european marketplace and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our international operations are subject to additional risks not encountered when doing business in the us  including foreign exchange risk  and our exposure to these risks will increase as we expand our international operations 
our international operations involve risks that may not exist when doing business in the us with employees in approximately countries outside the us  we generated of our net revenue for the year ended december  from our international operations 
in order to achieve widespread acceptance in each country we enter  we must tailor our services to the unique customs and cultures of that country 
learning the customs and cultures of various countries  particularly with respect to travel patterns and practices  is a difficult task and our failure to do so could slow our growth in international markets 
in addition  we are subject to certain risks as a result of having international operations and from having operations in multiple countries generally  including difficulties in staffing and managing operations due to distance  time zones  language and cultural differences  including issues associated with establishing management systems infrastructure in various countries  differences and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and exposure to local economic conditions  increased risk of piracy and limits on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights  preference of local populations for local providers  restrictions on the repatriation of non us investments and earnings back to the us  including withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions  diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights  and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
to the extent we are not able to effectively mitigate or eliminate these risks  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
further  our international operations require us to comply with a number of us and international regulations 
for example  we must comply with the foreign corrupt practices act  or fcpa  which prohibits us companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business  direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage 
any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees and agents comply with the 
table of contents fcpa and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions 
our ability to attract  train and retain executives and other qualified employees is critical to our results of operations and future growth 
we depend substantially on the continued services and performance of our key executives  senior management and skilled personnel  particularly our professionals with experience in our industry and our information technology and systems 
any of these individuals may chose to terminate their employment with us at any time 
the specialized skills we require can be difficult and time consuming to acquire and  as a result  these skills are often in short supply 
our recent reductions in workforce  our failure to meet threshold performance targets required to pay employee bonuses and the implementation of a company wide salary freeze may also negatively impact our ability to attract  hire and retain skilled personnel 
a lengthy period of time may be required to hire and train replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart the company 
our inability to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by  for example  delaying our ability to bring new products and services to market or impairing the success of our operations or prospects for future growth 
we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness  and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business 
we depend upon the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems  including technologies and systems utilized for reservations  communications  procurement and administrative systems 
certain of our businesses also utilize third party fare search solutions and gdss or other technologies 
as our operations grow in both size and scope  we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer our customers enhanced products  services  features and functionality  while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 
our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving industry standards while continuing to improve the performance  features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings and the changing demands of the marketplace 
in particular  expanding our systems and infrastructure to meet any potential increases in business volume will require us to commit substantial financial  operational and technical resources before those increases materialize  with no assurance that they actually will 
furthermore  our use of this technology could be challenged by claims that we have infringed upon the patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain our existing systems  obtain new technologies and systems  or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors or in a cost effective manner 
also  we may fail to achieve the benefits anticipated or required from any new technology or system  or we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future 
if any of these events occur  our business could suffer 
we are dependent upon third party systems and service providers  and any disruption or adverse change in their businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we currently rely on certain third party computer systems  service providers and software companies  including the electronic central reservation systems and gdss of the airline  hotel and car rental industries 
in particular  our businesses rely on third parties to conduct searches for airfares  process hotel room transactions  process credit card payments  and provide computer infrastructure critical to our business 

table of contents in addition  we rely on a group of business process outsourcing companies based in india to provide us with call center and telesales services  back office administrative services such as ticketing fulfillment  hotel rate loading and quality control  loyalty program support and information technology services  as well as financial services such as accounts payable processing and bank reconciliations 
any interruption in these third party services could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  we currently utilize gdss  including worldspan  galileo and amadeus  to process a significant portion of our bookings  and any interruption or deterioration in our gds partners products or services could prevent us from searching and booking airline and car rental reservations  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success is dependent on our ability to maintain relationships with our technology partners 
in the event our arrangements with any of these third parties are impaired or terminated  we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms  which could result in significant additional costs or disruptions to our business 
in addition  some of our agreements with third party service providers can be terminated by those parties on short notice and  in many cases  provide no recourse for service interruptions 
a termination of these services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
system interruptions and the lack of redundancy may cause us to lose customers or business opportunities 
our inability to maintain and improve our information technology systems and infrastructure may result in system interruptions 
system interruptions and slow delivery times  unreliable service levels  prolonged or frequent service outages  or insufficient capacity may prevent us from efficiently providing services to our customers  which could result in our losing customers and revenue or incurring liabilities 
in addition to the risks associated with inadequate maintenance or upgrading  our information technologies and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various causes  including natural disasters  war and acts of terrorism  power losses  computer systems failure  internet and telecommunications or data network failures  operator error  losses and corruption of data  and similar events  computer viruses  penetration by individuals seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other physical or electronic breaches of security  and the failure of third party systems or services that we rely upon to maintain our own operations 
we do not have backup systems for certain critical aspects of our operations 
for example  if we were unable to connect to certain third party systems  such as gdss  due to failure of our systems  our ability to process bookings could be significantly or completely impaired 
many other systems are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient 
in addition  we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate for losses from a major interruption  and remediation may be costly and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
any extended interruption in our technologies or systems could significantly curtail our ability to conduct our businesses and generate revenue 
we depend on our supplier relationships and adverse changes in these relationships or our inability to enter into new relationships could negatively affect our access to travel offerings and reduce our revenue 
in addition to airlines  we rely significantly on our relationships with hotel and other suppliers 
adverse changes in any of these relationships  or the inability to enter into new relationships  could negatively impact the availability and competitiveness of travel products offered on our websites 
our arrangements with suppliers may not remain in effect on current or similar terms  and the net impact of future pricing options may adversely impact our revenue 
in addition  suppliers are increasingly focused on driving online demand to their own websites 
suppliers typically do not charge a service fee for booking products on their own websites  and as a result  their travel offerings may be more attractive to consumers 

table of contents we are in continuous dialogue with our major hotel suppliers about the nature and extent of their participation in our various distribution channels 
the significant reduction by any of our major suppliers in their business with our companies for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal of doing business with us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we currently depend on one of travelport s businesses  gulliver s travel associates  or gta  for access to hotel inventory in certain international regions while we work to increase our own direct relationships with hotel suppliers in these regions 
if we are unable to successfully establish direct relationships with hotel suppliers or to replace our access to hotel inventory currently provided by gta in a timely manner or on comparable terms  we may not be able to operate our business effectively  and our financial performance may suffer 
our arrangements with the airlines generally do not require the airlines to provide any specific quantity of airline tickets or to make tickets available for any particular route or at any particular price 
in addition  certain of the airlines may terminate their agreements with us for any reason or no reason prior to the scheduled expiration date upon thirty days prior notice 
the significant reduction on the part of any of our major suppliers of their participation in our system for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our relationships with the airlines may be impacted by developments in the airline industry  such as increasing consolidation or shifts in market share from full service to low cost carriers 
in october  delta air lines  inc merged with northwest airlines  inc 
to become the world s largest airline  and there have been reports about potential merger discussions among certain of the remaining major us airlines 
in addition  the airline industry has experienced a shift in market share from full service carriers to low cost carriers that focus primarily on discount fares to leisure destinations and we expect this trend to continue 
some low cost carriers  such as southwest airlines  have not historically distributed their tickets through us or other third party intermediaries 
because our gds service agreement with travelport limits our ability to modify our existing agreements with the airlines or to enter into new  direct distribution arrangements  we may have limited flexibility to respond to developments in the airline industry  and we may be forced to forgo new partnering opportunities 
see we are dependent on travelport for our gds services below 
the limitations imposed by the gds service agreement may place us at a competitive disadvantage and could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
our business and financial performance could be negatively impacted by adverse tax events 
new sales  use  occupancy or other tax laws  statutes  rules  regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time 
those enactments could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations and our business and financial performance 
further  existing tax laws  statutes  rules  regulations or ordinances could be interpreted  changed  modified or applied adversely to us 
these events could require us to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis  as well as require us to pay fees  penalties and or interest for past amounts deemed to be due 
in addition  our revenue may decline because we could have to charge more for our products and services 
new  changed  modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could also increase our compliance  operating and other costs  as well as the costs of our products or services 
further  these events could decrease the capital we have available to operate our business 
any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance 
we and others in the online travel industry are currently subject to various lawsuits related to hotel occupancy tax in numerous jurisdictions in the us  and other jurisdictions may be considering similar lawsuits 
an adverse ruling in the existing hotel occupancy tax cases could require us to pay tax retroactively and prospectively  and possibly penalties  interest and or fees 
we have also been contacted by several municipalities or other taxing bodies concerning our possible obligation with respect to local hotel occupancy or related taxes  and certain municipalities have begun audit proceedings and some have issued assessments against the company 
if the company is found to be subject to the hotel occupancy tax ordinance by a taxing authority and appeals the decision in court  certain jurisdictions may attempt to require us to provide financial 
table of contents security or pay the assessment in order to challenge the tax assessment in court 
the proliferation of new hotel occupancy tax cases or audit proceedings could result in substantial additional defense costs 
these events could also adversely impact our business and financial performance see item  legal proceedings 
if our uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than our estimates  we will be required to adjust the related assets and liabilities which may have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and results of operations 
as of december   we have recorded estimated liabilities of million for uncertain income tax positions under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
our assessment of uncertain tax positions requires that we make estimates and judgments about the application of tax law  the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions and other matters 
if our uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than our estimates  we will be required to adjust the amounts of the related assets and liabilities  which may have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and our results of operations 
our businesses are highly regulated  and any failure to comply with such regulations or any changes in such regulations could adversely affect us 
we operate in a highly regulated industry both in the us and internationally 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or the enactment of new laws  rules and regulations applicable to us  which could decrease demand for our products and services  increase costs or subject us to additional liabilities 
moreover  regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations 
accordingly  these regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority 
our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  the various regulatory regimes to which we are subject may conflict so that compliance with the regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may create regulatory issues in another 
our business is subject to laws and regulations relating to our revenue generating and marketing activities  including those prohibiting unfair and deceptive advertising or practices 
our travel services are subject to regulation and laws governing the offer of travel products and services  including laws requiring us to register as a seller of travel in various jurisdictions and to comply with certain disclosure requirements 
as an otc that offers customers the ability to book air travel in the us  we are also subject to regulation by the department of transportation  which has authority to enforce economic regulations and may assess civil penalties or challenge our operating authority 
our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines  penalties and potential criminal violations 
any changes to these laws or regulations or any new laws or regulations may make it more difficult for us to operate our businesses and may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our processing  storage  use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation  conflicting legal requirements  differing views of personal privacy rights or security breaches 
in the processing of our traveler transactions  we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information 
this information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world 
this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information  including credit card information  that is collected  processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 
we could be adversely affected if domestic or international legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices  or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business 

table of contents travel companies have also been subjected to investigations  lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper disclosure of passenger information 
as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues  we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of travel data 
these and other privacy concerns  including security breaches  could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential in maintaining customer and supplier confidence in our services 
substantial or ongoing security breaches  whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other internet based systems  could significantly harm our business 
we currently require customers to guarantee their transactions with their credit cards online 
we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential customer information  including credit card numbers 
it is possible that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect customer transaction data 
we incur substantial expense to protect against and remedy security breaches and their consequences 
however  our security measures may not prevent security breaches 
we may be unsuccessful in implementing our remediation plan to address these potential exposures 
a party whether internal  external  an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in our operations 
security breaches also could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
security breaches could also cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security  which would have a negative effect on the demand for our products and services 
moreover  public perception concerning security and privacy on the internet could adversely affect customers willingness to use our websites 
a publicized breach of security  even if it only affects other companies conducting business over the internet  could inhibit the growth of the internet and  therefore  our services as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes  which could harm us 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  including  but not limited to  actions relating to intellectual property  in particular patent infringement claims against us  tax matters  employment law and other negligence  breach of contract and fraud claims  that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations 
the defense of these actions may be both time consuming and expensive 
if any of these legal proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we may not protect our intellectual property effectively  which would allow competitors to duplicate our products and services 
this could make it more difficult for us to compete with them 
our success and ability to compete depend  in part  upon our technology and other intellectual property  including our brands 
among our significant assets are our software and other proprietary information and intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and patent laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect these assets 
however  we have a limited number of patents  and our software and related documentation are protected principally under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection  and the laws of some jurisdictions provide less protection for our proprietary rights than the laws of the us we have granted travelport an exclusive license to our supplier link technology  including our patents related to that technology 
under the exclusive license  travelport has the first right to enforce those patents  and so we will only be able to bring actions to enforce those patents if travelport declines to do so 
unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  and the legal remedies available to us may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by unauthorized use 

table of contents further  intellectual property challenges have been increasingly brought against members of the travel industry 
these legal actions have in the past and might in the future result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
in addition  we may need to take legal action in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  and these enforcement actions could result in the invalidation or other impairment of intellectual property rights we assert 
we have a limited operating history as stand alone public company  and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 
our historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as an independent company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future  primarily as a result of the following factors our businesses were previously operated by cendant and travelport as part of their broader corporate organizations  rather than as an independent company 
travelport or one of its affiliates historically performed various corporate functions for us  including  but not limited to  tax administration  certain governance functions including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and internal audit and external reporting 
our historical combined consolidated results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from travelport for these and similar functions 
these allocations are less than the comparable expenses we believe we would have incurred had we operated as an independent company during those periods 
when our businesses were integrated with the other businesses of travelport  we shared economies of scope and scale in costs  employees  vendor relationships and customer relationships  as well as pursued integrated strategies with travelport and other businesses  including the gds and wholesale travel businesses 
although we entered into a transition services agreement and other agreements with travelport in connection with our initial public offering  these temporary arrangements may not capture the benefits our businesses previously enjoyed as a result of being integrated with the other businesses of travelport 
the loss of these benefits could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
previously  our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and capital expenditures  had been satisfied as part of the corporate wide cash management policies of travelport 
other than letters of credit issued by travelport on our behalf  travelport no longer provides us with funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements 
without the opportunity to obtain financing from travelport  we may need to obtain additional financing from banks through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
as a relatively new independent public company  we will expend additional time and resources to comply with rules and regulations governing public and listed companies  including rules related to internal controls over financial reporting  and our failure to comply with these rules may lead investors to lose confidence in our financial information 
as a relatively new independent public company  under the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations of the sec  as well as the rules of the new york stock exchange  we continue to implement additional corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules 
compliance with these public company obligations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and placed significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial  accounting and information systems  as compared to the periods during which we were not an independent public company 
in particular  for the year ended december   our management was required for the first time to conduct an annual evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and to issue a report on our 
table of contents internal controls in this annual report on form k 
in addition  we were required to have our independent public accounting firm attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or  if our independent auditors are unable to provide us with an attestation and an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  our investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock 
we have identified significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting 
in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we were required to make an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
although our auditors and we did not identify any matters constituting material weaknesses under the standards established by the public company accounting oversight board united states pcaob  our auditors and we have identified certain matters involving our internal control over financial reporting that constitute significant deficiencies 
the pcaob defines a material weakness as a deficiency  or combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
a significant deficiency is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness  yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting 
the significant deficiencies identified result from inconsistent application of controls related to the reconciliation of certain accounts at our hotelclub subsidiary 
although we are in the process of developing and implementing a remediation plan to address these deficiencies and believe they will be remediated  additional measures may be necessary  and the measures we expect to take to improve these deficiencies may not be sufficient to address the issues identified 
prior to the assessment performed in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we had identified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
although our auditors and we believe that we have addressed the material weaknesses  the measures we have taken may not be effective  and we may not be able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will not identify other material weaknesses or additional significant deficiencies in the future 
if we are unable to correct the identified deficiencies in our internal controls in a timely manner  or if we identify other material weaknesses or deficiencies in the future  our ability to record  process  summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec would be adversely affected 
this failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock  cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties  and adversely impact our business and financial condition 
travelport s controlling holders control us and may have strategic interests that differ from ours or our other shareholders 
currently  travelport and investment funds that own and or control travelport s ultimate parent company beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock and therefore  indirectly control us and all of our subsidiaries 
as a result of this ownership  travelport s controlling holders are entitled to nominate and elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of any actions requiring the approval of our stockholders  including adopting most amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approving or rejecting proposed mergers  significant new investments or divestments or sales of all or substantially all of our assets 

table of contents the interests of travelport s controlling holders may differ from those of our public shareholders in material respects 
travelport s controlling holders and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and maximizing the return on those investments 
they currently have  and may from time to time in the future acquire  interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or our suppliers or customers or businesses on which we are substantially dependent  such as the travelport gdss 
for example  in an effort to increase its revenues and improve its overall profitability  travelport could seek to change the terms of its commercial relationships with its gds customers 
because we are limited in our ability to pursue alternative gds options or direct connections with suppliers during the term of our gds agreement with travelport  any such actions by travelport could make us a less attractive distribution channel to our suppliers  who could attempt to terminate or renegotiate their agreements with us  and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other online travel companies 
see we are dependent on travelport for our gds services below 
in addition  travelport s customers  many of which are also major suppliers to us  have previously sought and may in the future seek to exert commercial leverage over us in an effort to obtain concessions from travelport  which could negatively affect our access to travel offerings and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as long as travelport s controlling holders continue to indirectly own a significant amount of our outstanding voting stock  even if that amount is less than  they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control us 
the interests of these holders may differ from our other shareholders interests in material respects 
actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between our management and directors as well as the management and directors of travelport 
jeff clarke serves as chairman of our board of directors  while retaining his role as president  chief executive officer and director of travelport 
the fact that mr 
clarke holds positions with both travelport and us could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest for him when he faces decisions that may affect both travelport and us 
in addition  mr 
paul c 
schorr iv  who is a senior managing director at the blackstone group  and mr 
william jg griffith  who is a general partner of tcv  and who both currently serve on the board of directors of travelport  serve on our board of directors 
the fact that mr 
schorr and mr 
griffith hold positions with their respective entities  travelport and us  could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when they face decisions that may affect two or more of these entities 
in addition  jill a 
greenthal  who is a senior advisor in the private equity group of the blackstone group  currently serves on our board of directors 
affiliates of the blackstone group exercise control over travelport s ultimate parent company and therefore  the fact that ms 
greenthal holds a position with the blackstone group could create  or appear to create  a potential conflict of interest when she faces decisions that affect both travelport and us 
further  our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of travelport who is also an officer or director of ours may be liable to us or our stockholders for a breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to travelport instead of us or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to us because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to travelport 
these provisions may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between travelport and us because the provisions effectively shield an overlapping director executive 
because of their former positions with travelport or its subsidiaries  some of our executive officers retained interests in travelport s ultimate parent company  some of which may be significant relative to their total assets 
continued ownership by our officers of these interests creates  or may create  the appearance of conflicts of interest when these officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for travelport than the decisions have for us 
for example  potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between travelport and us regarding the terms of commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates 
potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we enter into any other commercial arrangements with travelport in the future 

table of contents we are dependent on travelport for our gds services 
to varying extents  suppliers use gdss to connect their products and services with travel companies  who in turn make these products and services available to travelers for booking 
under our gds service agreement with travelport  we are required  subject to certain exceptions  to utilize galileo and worldspan  which are subsidiaries of travelport  for a significant portion of our gds services  and our contractual obligations to travelport for gds services may limit our ability to pursue alternative gds options 
as a result  if travelport became unwilling or was unable to provide these services to us  we may not be able to obtain alternative providers on a commercially reasonable basis  in a timely manner or at all  and our business would be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  our gds service agreement with travelport limits our ability to modify the terms of our agreements with existing suppliers or to pursue direct connections with new or existing suppliers during the term of the agreement  which expires on december  these contractual obligations may reduce our flexibility to implement changes to our business in response to changing economic conditions  industry trends  or technological developments 
as a result  the limitations imposed by the gds service agreement could place us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively impact our business and results of operations  particularly in the current economic environment where our suppliers are under increased pressure to reduce their overall distribution costs

travelport and its affiliates may use these technologies as part of  or in support of  their own products or services  including in some cases to directly compete with us 
the master license agreement permits travelport to sublicense our intellectual property other than our supplier link technology to a party that is not an affiliate of travelport  except that travelport may not sublicense our intellectual property to a third party for a use that competes with our business  unless travelport incorporates or uses our intellectual property with travelport products or services to enhance or improve travelport products or services other than to provide our intellectual property to third parties on a stand alone basis 
travelport and its affiliates are permitted to use our intellectual property to provide their own products and services to third parties that compete with us 
with respect to our supplier link technology  travelport has an unrestricted license 
these travelport rights could facilitate travelport s  its affiliates and third parties ability to compete with us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our certificate of incorporation limits our ability to engage in many transactions without the consent of travelport

our consolidated financial statements include the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of hotelclub since april  orbitz since november and ebookers since february prior to the ipo  we had not operated as an independent standalone company 
as a result  our consolidated financial statements have been carved out of the historical financial statements of cendant for the period prior to the blackstone acquisition and out of the historical financial statements of travelport for the period subsequent to the blackstone acquisition 
in connection with the blackstone acquisition  the carrying values of our assets and liabilities were revised to reflect their fair values as of august   based upon an allocation of the overall purchase price of travelport to the underlying net assets of the various travelport affiliates acquired 
our selected financial data is presented below on a successor basis reflecting travelport s ownership of us and predecessor basis reflecting cendant s ownership of us and has been separated by a vertical line to identify these different bases of accounting 
our historical consolidated financial statements do not reflect what our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate  standalone company without the shared resources of cendant in the predecessor periods and travelport in the successor periods

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview general we are a leading global online travel company that uses innovative technology to enable leisure and business travelers to search for and book a broad range of travel products 
our brand portfolio includes orbitz  cheaptickets  the away network  and orbitz for business in the americas  ebookers in europe  and hotelclub and ratestogo based in sydney  australia  which have operations globally 
we provide customers with the ability to book a comprehensive set of travel products  from over  suppliers worldwide  including air travel  hotels  vacation packages  car rentals  cruises  travel insurance and destination services such as ground transportation  event tickets and tours 
we generate revenue through multiple sources  including our retail model  merchant model  incentive payments  advertising  and white label and hosting business 
through our retail model  we earn commissions from suppliers for airline tickets  hotel rooms  car rentals and other travel products and services booked on our websites 
through our merchant model  we generate revenue for our services based on the difference between the total amount the customer pays for the travel product and the negotiated net rate plus estimated taxes that the supplier charges us for that product 
under both the retail and merchant models  we also earn revenue by charging customers a service fee for booking airline tickets  hotel rooms and certain other travel products 
in addition  we receive incentive payments for each segment of travel that is processed through a gds 
we generate advertising revenue through our partner marketing programs 
these programs provide direct access to our customer base through a combination of display advertising  performance based advertising and other marketing programs 
our white label and hosting businesses enable us to earn revenue by licensing our technology platform to  or hosting websites on behalf of  third party partners 
we are a leader in air travel  the largest online travel segment 
this leadership position has enabled us to drive growth in non air travel categories  such as hotels and dynamic vacation packages  which are vacation packages that include different combinations of travel products 
our non air travel categories generally 
table of contents generate higher net revenue per transaction  and we believe these categories present significant long term growth opportunities 
we also believe that there are long term growth opportunities in regions outside of the us for our international brands 
we experienced growth in our international gross bookings of and during the years ended december  and  respectively  excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the results of travelbag  an offline uk travel subsidiary that we sold in july the ability to continue to grow our international brands depends to a large extent on the scale of their operations 
in light of current economic and industry conditions  in the short term  we are focused on improving our operating efficiency  simplifying the way we do business  and continuing to innovate 
we have already taken steps to reduce our cost structure  by reducing our global workforce  our use of contractors and other operating costs  and by implementing a common technology platform for our ebookers websites 
we may continue to take additional measures going forward to further reduce our cost structure  as deemed necessary 
we intend to simplify our business  primarily with respect to our technology  which we believe will enable us to continue to develop new  innovative functionality on our websites  such as orbitz price assurance  more efficiently and with fewer resources 
we believe this short term strategy will better position us to manage through this challenging environment  until such time as economic and industry conditions improve and we redefine our long term strategy see item  business company strategy 
industry trends the economic and industry outlook deteriorated significantly for the fourth quarter of and into  as the global economy is experiencing a prolonged recession 
the weakening economy has caused unemployment rates to rise and lowered consumer confidence which  in turn  has resulted in changes to consumer spending patterns  including reduced spending on discretionary items  such as travel 
the current economic environment has already begun to significantly impact the travel industry  particularly the domestic airline industry 
as a result of higher fuel prices during the majority of and in response to lower demand  airlines raised ticket prices and implemented capacity reductions during the year ended december  as fuel prices returned to normal levels during the fourth quarter of  airlines have begun to decrease ticket prices 
however  as demand continues to weaken  certain domestic airlines have announced further capacity reductions in the current economic environment has also begun to impact the international airline industry 
in response to lower demand  international airlines have announced that they will also implement capacity reductions in we believe that capacity reductions and any increase in airline ticket prices that could result from these reductions will negatively impact demand for air travel 
lower demand for air travel could impact the net revenue that online travel companies otcs generate from the booking of airline tickets and in turn  impact net revenue generated from the booking of other travel products  such as hotels and car rentals 
potential bankruptcies and consolidation in the airline industry could also result in capacity reductions that could further increase ticket prices and reduce the number of seats available for booking on otcs websites 
globally  airlines are also under increased pressure to reduce their overall costs  including costs of distributing air travel through otcs and gdss 
as a result  our distribution partners could attempt to terminate or renegotiate their agreements with us on more favorable terms to them  which could reduce the revenue we generate from those agreements 
in addition  any pressure placed on gdss by the airlines may result in an attempt by the gdss to pass additional costs to us 
the current economic environment has also begun to impact the car rental industry 
in response to lower demand for air travel  demand for car rentals has also declined  and we expect this trend to continue into lower demand for car rentals could impact the net revenue that otcs generate from the booking of car rentals 
the financial condition of car rental companies has also begun to deteriorate  which may result in potential bankruptcies and industry consolidation 
potential bankruptcies and industry consolidation could cause an increase in average daily rates adrs for car rentals as well as a reduction in the number of cars available for booking on otcs websites 

table of contents beginning in september  fundamentals in the us hotel industry also began to weaken 
hotel occupancy rates and adrs declined in september for the first time in several years and continued to decline during the remainder of we believe that hotel suppliers will continue to lower adrs into in order to improve hotel occupancy rates during a time of weakening demand 
fundamentals in the european and asia pacific hotel industries have also begun to deteriorate 
a deterioration of adrs would negatively impact the net revenue that otcs earn per hotel booking 
we believe that our gross bookings and net revenue for the year ended december   particularly for the fourth quarter of  were significantly impacted by the economic and industry conditions described above 
we expect this trend to continue into as a result  we have taken steps to reduce our cost structure to better manage through this challenging environment 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we reduced our global workforce  our use of outside contractors and other operating expenses 
we expect to realize approximately to million of annualized cash savings from these actions 
despite the macroeconomic environment  internet usage and online travel bookings continue to increase worldwide 
online travel booking rates are highest in the us and have grown on a year over year basis 
suppliers  including airlines  hotels and car rental companies  have continued to focus their efforts on direct sale of their products through their own websites  further promoting the migration of customers to online booking 
in the current environment  suppliers websites are believed to be taking domestic and international market share from both otcs and traditional offline travel companies 
we believe that the rate of growth of online travel bookings in the domestic market has slowed as this market has matured 
much of the initial rapid growth experienced in the online travel industry was driven by consumers shifting from purchasing travel through traditional offline channels to purchasing travel through online channels 
accordingly  we believe that growth rates in the domestic online travel market may more closely follow the growth rates of the overall travel industry 
internationally  the online travel industry continues to benefit from rapidly increasing internet usage and growing acceptance of online booking 
we expect international growth rates for the online travel industry to continue to outpace growth rates of the overall travel industry 
as a result  we believe otcs will increasingly generate a larger percentage of their growth from outside of the us the hotel only business models have had particular success in delivering high growth rates in international markets 
our international brands  including ebookers  hotelclub and ratestogo  provide us with growth opportunities outside of the us however  competitive pressures combined with a weakening global economy have and may continue to negatively impact the growth of our international brands 
the booking of air travel has become increasingly driven by price 
as a result  we believe that otcs will continue to focus on differentiating themselves from supplier websites by offering customers the ability to selectively combine travel products such as air  car  hotel and destination services into dynamic vacation packages 
through dynamic vacation packages  we are able to make certain products available to our customers at prices that are generally lower than booking each travel product separately 
we foresee significant growth potential for otcs for these types of services  particularly given that travelers are increasingly price sensitive and suppliers are more dependent on alternative distribution channels in the current economic environment 
our net revenue per transaction is generally higher for dynamic vacation packages than for stand alone travel products 
some otcs charge a booking fee in connection with the booking of airline tickets and certain other travel products 
we charge a service fee on many of our websites  and in exchange  provide our customers the ability to book their travel reservation and access to various services  including our orbitztlc customer care platform and orbitz price assurance 
certain otcs have reduced or eliminated booking fees on retail airline tickets and hotel rooms  which has created uncertainty around the sustainability of booking fees 
we will continue to monitor the competitive environment and regularly evaluate our fee structure 
otcs make significant investments in marketing through both online and traditional offline channels 
key areas of online marketing include search engine marketing  display advertising  affiliate programs and email marketing 
online marketing costs have been rising in the us over time  and competition for search engine 
table of contents key words has intensified in the past year 
increasing competition from supplier websites and the growing significance of search and meta search sites has contributed to the increase in online marketing costs 
if this trend continues  these rising costs could result in lower margins or declining transaction growth rates for otcs 
we are actively pursuing tactics to optimize the results of our online marketing efforts by increasing the value from existing traffic and by acquiring additional traffic that is more targeted and cost effective 
these tactics include pay per click optimization and search optimization efforts  loyalty programs and email marketing that target customers with offers that correspond to their particular interests 
results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion and analysis covers periods both prior to and subsequent to the blackstone acquisition 
the results for the years ended december  and december  and for the period from august  through december  are presented on a successor basis reflecting travelport s ownership of us 
the financial statements for the period from january  through august  are presented on a predecessor basis reflecting cendant s ownership of us 
the discussion and analysis of historical periods prior to august  does not reflect the impact that the blackstone acquisition had on our results  including the effect of purchase accounting adjustments 
therefore  the combined results of the successor and the predecessor for the periods in are not necessarily comparable 
the presentation of the results for the year ended december  on a combined basis does not comply with gaap  however  we believe that this provides useful information to assess the relative performance of our businesses in the periods presented in the financial statements on an ongoing basis 
the captions included within our statements of operations that are materially impacted by this change in basis of accounting primarily include net revenue  depreciation and amortization and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  at the date of the blackstone acquisition  the assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values to reflect our portion of the overall blackstone acquisition purchase price 
this resulted in an increase in the value of intangible assets and a corresponding increase in amortization expense 
key operating metrics our operating results are affected by certain key metrics that represent overall transaction activity 
gross bookings and net revenue are two key metrics 
gross bookings is defined as the total amount paid by a consumer for transactions booked under both the retail and merchant models 
net revenue is defined as commissions earned from suppliers under our retail model  the difference between the total amount the customer pays us for a travel product and the negotiated net rate plus estimated taxes that the supplier charges us for that travel product under our merchant model  service fees earned from customers under both our retail and merchant models  as well as advertising revenue and certain other fees and commissions 
gross bookings provide insight into changes in overall travel activity levels  changes in industry wide online booking activity  and more specifically  changes in the number of bookings through our websites 
we follow net revenue trends for our various brands  geographies and product categories to gain insight into the performance of our business across these categories 
both metrics are important in determining the ongoing growth of our business

comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  gross bookings for our domestic business  which is comprised principally of orbitz  cheaptickets and orbitz for business  total gross bookings decreased million  or  during the year ended december  from the year ended december  of the million decrease  million was due to a decrease in domestic air gross bookings  which was driven by lower transaction volume as a result of the adverse impact of economic conditions on air traveler demand  capacity reductions and our reduction in online marketing expenditures 
a higher average price per airline ticket  due to higher fuel prices during the majority of and capacity reductions  partially offset the decrease in volume 
non air and other gross bookings increased 
table of contents million  or  during the year ended december  from the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by higher gross bookings for dynamic packaging 
gross bookings for dynamic packaging increased due to higher transaction volume and a higher average price per dynamic package 
an increase in the average price per airline ticket included in a dynamic package primarily drove the higher average price per dynamic package 
a decrease in gross bookings for car rentals and hotels partially offset this increase 
lower transaction volume  offset in part by a higher average price per transaction  drove the decline in gross bookings for car rentals and hotels 
the higher average price per transaction for domestic hotel gross bookings was mainly due to growth in adrs through august of  as we experienced a significant decline in adrs in the fourth quarter of  which we expect will continue into for our international business  which is comprised principally of ebookers  hotelclub and ratestogo  total gross bookings increased million  or  during the year ended december  from the year ended december  of this increase  million was due to foreign currency fluctuations 
the remaining million increase was due to a million increase in air gross bookings and a million increase in non air and other gross bookings 
the increase in air gross bookings primarily resulted from a higher average price per airline ticket  due in part to higher fuel prices during the majority of  and higher transaction volume 
the growth in non air and other gross bookings was primarily driven by increases in gross bookings for dynamic packaging  and  to a lesser extent  car rentals

net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of the blackstone acquisition  our net revenue during the year ended december  was reduced due to deferred revenue that was written off at the time of the acquisition 
accordingly  we could not record revenue that was generated before the blackstone acquisition but not yet recognized at the time of the acquisition 
the following discussion and analysis describes the impact on the comparability of net revenue year over year due to our inability to record this revenue  and refers to these amounts as purchase accounting adjustments 
air 
net revenue from air bookings decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  foreign currency fluctuations 
table of contents resulted in an increase of million in air net revenue 
the decrease in net revenue from air bookings  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations was million 
a decrease in domestic volume resulted in a million decrease in air net revenue  which was partially offset by a million increase in air net revenue driven by higher net revenue per air ticket 
the decrease in volume is partially due to increased competition and the adverse impact of economic conditions on air traveler demand 
the higher net revenue per air ticket is primarily due to an increase in service fees charged on our orbitz and cheaptickets websites  an increase in incentive revenue earned from gds services provided by worldspan resulting from the re negotiation of our gds contract in july  and a shift in our carrier mix 
a reduction in paper ticket fees partially offset these increases  as the industry continues to move towards electronic ticketing to meet the international air transport association mandate to eliminate paper tickets 
lower net revenue per air ticket and the impact of the sale of our offline uk travel subsidiary in july primarily drove the decrease in international air net revenue 
competitive pressures drove the decrease in net revenue per air ticket 
this decrease was largely offset by an increase in air net revenue resulting from higher international volume 
non air 
non air net revenue is comprised of net revenue from hotel bookings  dynamic packaging which may include a combination of travel products  such as air  hotel and car reservations  car bookings  cruise bookings and destination services 
net revenue from non air bookings increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was due to foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  net revenue increased million year over year due to purchase accounting adjustments  which reduced our non air net revenue by million for the year ended december  the remaining increase in net revenue from non air bookings  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and purchase accounting adjustments  was million 
the domestic increase in non air net revenue of million was driven by higher net revenue from hotel bookings  dynamic packaging and car bookings 
the increase in net revenue from hotel bookings was due to higher average net revenue per transaction  primarily driven by an increase in merchant hotel mix 
lower hotel volume  due in part to increased competition and the adverse impact of economic conditions  partially offset the higher average net revenue per transaction 
the increase in net revenue from dynamic packaging is partially due to an increase in supplier driven sales promotions in  which drove higher volumes  offset in part by lower average net revenue per transaction 
net revenue from dynamic packaging further increased due to enhancements we made to our car packaging product during the year as well as a general shift in traveler demand towards dynamic packaging  from stand alone travel products 
the increase in net revenue from car bookings is mainly due to an increase in average net revenue per car booking  primarily driven by the re negotiation of contracts with certain car suppliers during the second quarter of lower car volume partially offset the higher average net revenue per transaction 
the increase in international non air net revenue of million was driven primarily by higher net revenue from dynamic packaging bookings and car bookings  partially offset by the impact of the sale of our offline uk travel subsidiary in july other 
other net revenue is primarily comprised of advertising and travel insurance revenue and revenue from our hosting business 
other net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  almost nil was due to foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  net revenue increased million year over year due to purchase accounting adjustments  which resulted in a reduction in our other net revenue of million for the year ended december  the remaining increase in other net revenue  after taking into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and purchase accounting adjustments  was million 
the remaining increase in other net revenue is primarily due to a million increase in domestic other net revenue and a million increase in international other net revenue 
the domestic increase is primarily attributed to an increase in advertising revenue  which largely resulted from the launch of a new advertising campaign during promoting a third party s fee membership programs 
the terms of this agreement are 
table of contents more favorable than the terms with our former membership program advertiser 
advertising revenue also increased as a result of our continued efforts to seek out new opportunities to further monetize traffic on our websites 
domestic other net revenue further increased due to an increase in travel insurance revenue  driven primarily by higher attachment rates for travel insurance and more favorable economics resulting from the execution of a new agreement with our travel insurance provider  which was effective in the increase in international other net revenue is due to an increase in travel insurance revenue  and to a lesser extent  an increase in advertising revenue 
the increase in travel insurance revenue is largely due to the introduction of a new travel insurance product on one of our ebookers websites as well as higher attachment rates for travel insurance 
advertising revenue increased as a result of our continued efforts to seek out new opportunities to further monetize traffic on our websites 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue is primarily comprised of costs incurred to operate our customer service call centers  credit card processing fees incurred on our merchant bookings  ticketing and fulfillment costs  charge backs  and connectivity and other processing costs 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenue was driven by an million increase in affiliate commissions  a million increase in gds connectivity costs  a million increase in charge backs and a million increase in credit card processing fees  partially offset by a million decrease in customer service costs and a million decrease in ticketing costs 
the increase in affiliate commissions was primarily due to the growth of our white label business 
higher transaction volume from our international locations primarily drove the increase in gds connectivity costs 
the increase in charge backs was due primarily to an increase in fraudulent credit card usage at one of our international locations 
we have installed new revenue protection software and instituted tighter security measures  and as a result  we experienced a significant decrease in these charge backs towards the end of the second quarter of that continued through the remainder of the year 
growth in our merchant bookings resulted in higher credit card processing fees 
lower domestic transaction volume primarily drove the decrease in customer service costs 
ticketing costs decreased during as the industry continued to move towards electronic ticketing to meet the international air transport association mandate to eliminate paper tickets 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of wages and benefits  consulting and professional services fees  and data center and network communication costs 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded a one time exit penalty of million due to the early termination of an agreement and incurred million of one time audit and consulting fees in connection with our ipo and the post ipo transition period 
the absence of these costs in the year ended december  primarily drove the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense 
in addition  our selling  general and administrative expense decreased by million during the year ended december  due to a reduction in the present value of our liability under the tax sharing agreement  which primarily arose from a reduction in our effective state income tax rate see note tax sharing liability of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we also recorded an million reduction to selling  general and administrative expense during the year ended december  compared to a million reduction in the year ended december  for the insurance reimbursement of costs we previously incurred to defend hotel occupancy tax cases  which also contributed to the decrease 
selling  general and administrative expense also decreased million primarily due to the capitalization of development costs during the year ended december  associated with the launch of our remaining ebookers websites onto the new technology platform in 
table of contents these expense decreases were partially offset by a million increase in our wages and benefits  a million increase in our tax consulting costs  a million increase in losses resulting from foreign currency fluctuations and a million increase in other operating expenses 
the increase in wages and benefits was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation and higher staffing levels as we continue to build our hotel sourcing team and as we realize the full year impact of capabilities added in in the areas of finance and legal to undertake corporate level functions previously provided by travelport 
a decrease due to the sale of our offline uk travel subsidiary in july due to the inclusion of seven months of expense from that subsidiary in partially offset the increase in wages and benefits 
we incurred higher tax consulting costs during the year ended december  as a result of the transition of the corporate tax function  which was previously provided by travelport  to us 
marketing our marketing expense is primarily comprised of online marketing costs  such as search and banner advertising  and offline marketing costs  such as television  radio and print advertising 
our investment in online marketing is significantly greater than our investment in offline marketing 
marketing expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in marketing expense was driven by an increase in our international marketing expense  which increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  higher online marketing costs for our international locations  driven by growth in transaction volume and higher cost per transaction  primarily drove this increase 
a reduction in offline marketing costs at our international locations partially offset this increase 
offline marketing costs decreased due to a general shift in spending from offline to online marketing 
in the prior year  we launched a new offline advertising campaign for our ebookers brand in the uk  which did not continue into our domestic marketing expense remained flat year over year  at million for each of the years ended december  and december  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from an increase in capitalized software placed in service  primarily related to the roll out of our new technology platform in july  and the acceleration of depreciation on certain assets whose useful lives were shortened during the year ended december  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended december   in connection with our annual planning process  we lowered our long term earnings forecast in response to changes in the economic environment  as described in the section entitled industry trends above 
these factors  coupled with a prolonged decline in our market capitalization  indicated potential impairment of our goodwill  trademarks and trade names 
additionally  given the current environment  our distribution partners are under increased pressure to reduce their overall costs and could attempt to terminate or renegotiate their agreements with us on more favorable terms to them 
these factors indicated that the carrying value of certain of our finite lived intangible assets  specifically customer relationships  may not be recoverable 
as a result  we performed an impairment test of our goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and finite lived intangible assets 
based on the testing performed  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million  of which million related to goodwill  million related to trademarks and trade names and million related to customer relationships see note impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there was no impairment during the year ended december  due to the current economic uncertainty and other factors  we cannot assure that goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and finite lived intangible assets will not be further impaired in future periods 

table of contents interest expense  net interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the repayment of million of intercompany notes payable to travelport and  to a lesser extent  the assignment of certain notes payable between subsidiaries of travelport and our subsidiaries to us  both of which occurred in connection with the ipo 
this decrease was offset in part by interest expense incurred on the million term loan facility entered into concurrent with the ipo and the corresponding interest rate swaps entered into to hedge a portion of the variable interest payments on the term loan 
an increase in interest expense accreted on the tax sharing liability and a decrease in capitalized interest on internal software development projects also partially offset the decrease in interest expense 
during the year ended december  and december   million and million of the total interest expense recorded was non cash  respectively 
benefit provision for income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  and a tax provision of million for the year ended december  the tax benefit recorded during the year ended december  related to certain of our international subsidiaries 
the amount of the tax benefit recorded during the year ended december  is disproportionate to the amount of pre tax net loss incurred during the year primarily because we are not able to realize any tax benefits on the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of the tax provision recorded during the year ended december  was primarily due to a valuation allowance established in the third quarter of against million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  net of tax  related to portions of our uk based business

this increase helped offset an international decrease of million driven by lower net revenue per air ticket 
the lower net revenue per air ticket primarily resulted from an increase in mix of short haul flights  the introduction of low cost carriers on our websites in europe and decreased compensation from suppliers 
the sale of our offline uk travel subsidiary in july reduced the overall growth in international air net revenue due to the inclusion of seven months of net revenue from that business in as compared to a full year in non air 
non air net revenue is comprised of net revenue from hotel bookings  dynamic packaging which may include a combination of travel products  such as air  hotel and car reservations  car bookings  cruise bookings and destination services 
net revenue from our non air business increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was due to foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  net revenue increased million year over year due to purchase accounting adjustments  which resulted in a reduction in our non air net revenue of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the remaining increase in net revenue from non air bookings  after taking into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and purchase accounting adjustments  was million 
an increase in domestic hotel and dynamic packaging net revenue of million and million  respectively  primarily drove the domestic increase in non air net revenue of million 
domestic net revenue from hotel bookings increased due to higher net revenue per transaction  primarily driven by a shift in mix from retail to merchant  higher adrs and a longer average length of stay 
an increase in transaction volume and net revenue per transaction drove the increase in net revenue from dynamic packaging 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in net revenue from car rentals and cruises 
an increase in international hotel and dynamic packaging net revenue of million and million  respectively  primarily drove the international increase in non air net revenue of million 
this increase in international hotel and dynamic packaging net revenue was partially offset by decreases in net revenue from car rentals and cruises 
the sale of our offline uk travel subsidiary in july reduced the overall growth in international non air net revenue due to the inclusion of seven months of net revenue from that business in as compared to a full year in other 
other net revenue is primarily comprised of advertising and travel insurance revenue and revenue from our hosting business 
other net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was due to foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  net revenue increased million year over year due to purchase accounting adjustments  which resulted in a reduction in our other net revenue of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the remaining increase in other net revenue  after taking into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and purchase accounting adjustments  was million 
the remaining increase in other net revenue is primarily due to a million increase in domestic other net revenue  which is partially offset by a million decrease in international other net revenue 
the domestic 
table of contents increase is primarily attributed to an increase in travel insurance revenue  driven by higher air and dynamic vacation package volume  and to a lesser extent  higher net revenue per transaction 
domestic other net revenue further increased due to an increase in advertising revenue 
the decrease in international other net revenue is primarily attributed to the sale of our offline uk travel subsidiary in july due to the inclusion of seven months of net revenue from that business in as compared to a full year in cost of revenue our cost of revenue is primarily comprised of costs incurred to operate our customer service call centers  credit card processing fees incurred on our merchant bookings  ticketing costs  charge backs  and connectivity and other processing costs 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenue was driven by a million increase in customer service costs  a million increase in charge backs and a million increase in credit card processing fees 
higher domestic and international transaction volume  coupled with the opening of additional call centers  primarily resulted in higher customer service costs during the year ended december  the increase in charge backs was due primarily to an increase in fraudulent credit card usage at one of our international locations during growth in our merchant bookings resulted in higher credit card processing fees 
selling  general and administrative expense our selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of wages and benefits  consulting and professional services fees  and system maintenance and network communication costs 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million to million during the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded a one time exit penalty of million due to the early termination of an agreement and incurred million of one time audit and consulting fees in connection with our ipo and the post ipo transition period 
these expense increases were more than offset by a million decrease in our wages and benefits  a million decrease in our facilities expense  a million decrease resulting from insurance reimbursements received and a million decrease in other operating expenses 
the decrease in wages and benefits was primarily due to the sale of our offline uk travel subsidiary in july due to the inclusion of seven months of expense from that subsidiary in as compared to a full year of expense in and an overall reduction in head count at our international subsidiaries during the decrease in facilities costs is primarily due to a decrease in rent expense as a result of the relocation of our corporate office  and to a lesser extent  a reduction in our office space leased in the uk we recorded a million reduction to selling  general and administrative expense during the year ended december  for the insurance reimbursement of costs we previously incurred to defend hotel occupancy tax cases 
no such reimbursements were received in marketing our marketing expense is primarily comprised of online marketing costs  such as search and banner advertising  and offline marketing costs  such as television  radio and print advertising 
our investment in online marketing is significantly greater than our investment in offline marketing 
marketing expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  domestically  our marketing expense increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   which was primarily driven by an increase in online marketing costs 
our online marketing costs increased largely due to the growth in transactions sourced through online channels as well as an increase in the cost of key words which we bid on to drive customers to our websites 
internationally  our marketing expense increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   which was 
table of contents partially driven by an increase in online marketing expense due to the growth in transaction volume 
we also incurred higher offline marketing costs due to the launch of a new marketing campaign in september to promote our ebookers brand in the uk depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a change in the useful lives of certain assets as a result of purchase accounting applied in connection with the blackstone acquisition 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase due to assets placed in service  primarily in connection with the roll out of our new technology platform in the uk and ireland 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets impairment of intangible assets decreased million  or  to for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we recorded a charge in the year ended december  for impairment of predecessor goodwill and intangible assets 
the impairment primarily related to a decline in ebookers fair value relative to its carrying value 
this decline was the result of ebookers poor operating performance following its acquisition by cendant due to various operational issues 
interest expense  net interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense during the period was primarily attributable to million of interest incurred on the million of intercompany notes payable to travelport 
these notes were repaid in connection with the ipo see note related party transactions of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the remaining increase was primarily due to million of interest incurred on the million term loan facility that we entered into in july partially offsetting these increases in interest expense was million of capitalized interest on internal software development and a decrease in imputed interest on the tax sharing liability of million see note summary of significant accounting policies and note tax sharing liability of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the years ended december  and  million and million of the total interest expense recorded was non cash  respectively 
provision for income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in our provision for income taxes was primarily due to a valuation allowance established against million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  net of tax  related to portions of our uk based business see note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions for a discussion of certain relationships and related party transactions  see note related party transactions of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our businesses experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
the majority of our customers book travel for leisure purposes rather than for business 
gross bookings for leisure travel are generally highest in the first and second calendar quarters as customers plan and book their spring and summer vacations 
however  net revenue generated under the merchant model is generally recognized when the travel takes place and typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer 
as a result  our cash receipts are generally highest in the first and second calendar quarters and our net revenue is typically 
table of contents highest in the second and third calendar quarters 
our seasonality may also be affected by fluctuations in the travel products our suppliers make available to us for booking  the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our principal sources of liquidity are our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents  and borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
at december  and december   our cash and cash equivalents balances were million and million  respectively 
we had million and million of availability under our revolving credit facility at december  reflective of the effective reduction in total availability under our revolving credit facility in september as described below and december   respectively  reflecting total available liquidity from cash and cash equivalents and our revolving credit facility of million and million at december  and  respectively 
prior to our ipo  our financing needs were supported by travelport 
we also require letters of credit to support certain commercial agreements  leases and certain regulatory agreements 
as of december   substantially all of these letters of credit were issued by travelport on our behalf under the terms of the separation agreement we entered into with travelport in connection with the ipo  which has since been amended the separation agreement 
at december  and december   there were million and million of outstanding letters of credit issued by travelport on our behalf  respectively 
under our merchant model  customers generally pay us for reservations at the time of booking  which is in advance of their travel 
we pay our suppliers at some later date  which is generally after the customer uses the reservation 
initially  we record these customer receipts as deferred income and accrued merchant payables 
we recognize net revenue when customers use the reservation  and we pay our suppliers once we have received an invoice  which generally ranges from one to sixty days after customers use the reservation 
the timing difference between the cash collected from our customers and payments to our suppliers impacts our operating cash flows and represents a source of liquidity for us 
if our merchant model bookings grow  we expect to experience this positive impact on our operating cash flows 
conversely  if our merchant model bookings decline or there are changes to the model which reduce the time between the receipt of cash from our customers and payments to suppliers  these benefits would be reduced 
due to various factors  including a decline in our merchant bookings  the liquidity provided by cash flows from our merchant model bookings decreased in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the seasonal fluctuations in our business also affect the timing of our cash flows 
gross bookings are generally highest in the first and second calendar quarters as customers plan and purchase their spring and summer vacations 
as a result  our cash receipts are generally highest in the first and second calendar quarters  and we generally use cash during the third and fourth calendar quarters to pay our suppliers 
we expect this seasonal cash flow pattern to continue 
however  changes in our business model could either increase or decrease the seasonal nature of our cash flows 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million as compared to a deficit of million as of december  prior to our ipo  we operated with a working capital deficit primarily as a result of the cash management system used by travelport to pool cash from all of its subsidiaries  including us  as well as the fact that certain operating cash flows generated by us were used to fund certain of our financing and investing activities  such as capital expenditures incurred for the development and implementation of our new technology platform 
the net proceeds we received from the initial public offering of our common stock and the million term loan did not decrease this working capital deficit because those proceeds were used to repay million of intercompany notes payable to affiliates of travelport  to pay a million dividend to an affiliate of travelport and to settle other intercompany balances between us and travelport that were generated prior to the ipo 

table of contents as a result  immediately following our ipo  we continued to have a working capital deficit 
because of this deficit  we use cash from customer transactions as well as borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital requirements  including certain investing and financing commitments  such as capital expenditures and principal payments on our outstanding term loan  respectively 
over time  we expect to decrease this deficit through continued growth in our business and the generation of positive cash flow from operations  which we expect to achieve by improving our operating efficiency  simplifying the way we do business and continuing to innovate 
we generated positive cash flow from operations for the years ended december  through  despite experiencing net losses 
historically  we have incurred losses due to significant non cash expenses  such as the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we utilize this cash flow to fund our operations  make principal and interest payments on our debt  finance capital expenditures and meet our other cash needs 
we invest cash flow from operations into our business 
historically  this cash flow has primarily financed the development and expansion of our new technology platform 
we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we expect annual cash flow from operations to remain positive in the foreseeable future 
we intend to continue to use this cash flow to fund capital expenditures as well as other investing and financing activities  such as the repayment of debt 
for the year ended december   we expect our capital expenditures to be between million and million 
lehman commercial paper inc lcpi  which filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code on october   holds a million commitment  or percent  of the million available under our revolving credit facility 
as a result  total availability under our revolving credit facility has effectively been reduced from million to million 
we do not believe that this reduction in availability will have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position 
we currently believe that cash flow generated from operations  cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility despite having been effectively reduced will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  in the future  our liquidity could be negatively impacted as a result of changes in our business model  changes to payment terms or other supplier imposed requirements  lower than anticipated operating cash flows or other unanticipated events  such as unfavorable outcomes in our legal proceedings 
for example  the liquidity provided by cash flows from our merchant model bookings could be negatively impacted if our suppliers  including credit card processors and hotels  changed their payment terms or imposed other requirements on us  such as requiring us to provide letters of credit or to establish cash reserves  or if our merchant model bookings declined as a result of current economic conditions or other factors 
if in the future  we require more liquidity than is available to us under our revolving credit facility  we may need to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings 
in the event additional financing is required  our ability to raise third party debt may be limited by the covenants and restrictions under our senior secured credit agreement see financing arrangements below and may require the consent of travelport pursuant to the terms of our certificate of incorporation 
in addition  financing may not be available to us at all or may not be available to us at favorable terms  particularly in the wake of the current economic environment 
we may raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  which could result in potential dilution of our stockholders equity 
however  any such issuance may require the consent of travelport and our other shareholders 
furthermore  if we require letters of credit in excess of the million available under the facility provided by travelport or if we require letters of credit denominated in foreign currencies and are unable to obtain these letters of credit  we would be required to issue such letters of credit under our revolving credit facility  which could  depending upon the amount  substantially reduce available liquidity

we generated cash flow from operations of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in operating cash flows was largely driven by a million decrease in cash interest expense due to the repayment of intercompany notes to travelport in connection with the ipo  offset in part by a million increase in cash interest expense incurred on our million revolving credit facility  the million term loan and the corresponding interest rate swaps entered into to hedge a portion of the variable interest payments on the term loan 
accrued expenses drove an additional million increase in operating cash flows 
this increase was primarily driven by the timing of payments of domestic accrued marketing expenditures 
the remaining increase in operating cash flows during the year ended december  was primarily due to the overall growth of our operations 
the cash flow increases discussed above were partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable  driven largely by timing of payments  as a result of changes in our payment mechanisms and cash management policies following our ipo 
a million decrease in accrued merchant payables and an million decrease in deferred income also offset the cash flow increases 
these decreases were primarily driven by a decrease in transaction volume  particularly for hotel bookings  during the fourth quarter of the cash flow increases above were further offset by changes in other operating assets and liabilities 
investing activities cash flow used in investing activities decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow used in investing activities is primarily due to the sale of an offline uk travel subsidiary in july the sale of this subsidiary resulted in a million reduction in cash due to the buyer s assumption of this subsidiary s cash balance at the time of sale  partially offset by the cash proceeds we received for the sale of the subsidiary 

table of contents this decrease in cash flow used in investing activities is partially offset by a million increase in capital expenditures as well as the absence of the receipt of proceeds from asset sales during we received million of cash proceeds from asset sales during financing activities cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million of cash flow provided by financing activities for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow provided by financing activities of million is partially due to the absence of net proceeds received from the ipo and the million term loan facility entered into concurrent with the ipo  offset in part by repayments of the intercompany notes to travelport  a dividend paid to travelport in connection with the ipo and net cash distributed to and received from travelport in prior to the ipo 
following our ipo  we are no longer required to distribute available cash to travelport 
cash flow used in financing activities increased largely due to million of payments made under the tax sharing agreement with the founding airlines  a million increase in principal payments made on the million term loan facility and million of payments made to satisfy employee minimum tax withholding obligations upon vesting of equity based awards during the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow provided by financing activities is offset in part by a million increase in borrowings made under our revolving credit facility during the year ended december  and a million decrease in capital lease payments 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  operating activities cash provided by operating activities consists of net loss  adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and stock based compensation and changes in various working capital items  principally accrued merchant payables  deferred income and accounts payable 
we generated cash flow from operations of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in operating cash flow during is largely due to million of cash interest payments made during primarily related to intercompany notes payable to travelport that were outstanding prior to the ipo and the million term loan facility and million revolving credit facility that we entered into concurrent with the ipo 
we did not have any third party debt outstanding during the decrease in cash flow from operations was also attributed to changes in accrued merchant payable and deferred income balances

table of contents financing arrangements on july   concurrent with the ipo  we entered into a million senior secured credit agreement credit agreement consisting of a seven year million term loan facility term loan and a six year million revolving credit facility revolver 
the term loan and the revolver bear interest at variable rates  at our option  of libor or an alternative base rate plus a margin 
at december  and december   million and million was outstanding on the term loan  respectively  and million and million was outstanding on the revolver  respectively 
as described above  in connection with lcpi filing for bankruptcy protection  total availability under our revolver has effectively been reduced from million to million 
our term loan and revolver are both secured by substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries tangible and intangible assets  including a pledge of of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of substantially all of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock or other equity interests of certain of our foreign subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
our term loan and revolver are also guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains various customary restrictive covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness or guarantees  enter into sale or leaseback transactions  make investments  loans or acquisitions  grant or incur liens on our assets  sell our assets  engage in mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  engage in transactions with affiliates  and make restricted payments 
the credit agreement requires us not to exceed a maximum total leverage ratio  which declines over the term of the agreement  and to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  each as defined in the credit agreement 
if we fail to comply with these covenants and we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment  our lenders could accelerate the maturity of all amounts borrowed under our term loan and revolving credit facility and could proceed against the collateral securing this indebtedness 
we are permitted  however  to cure any such failure by issuing equity to certain permitted holders  as defined in the credit agreement  which include the blackstone group and certain of its affiliates 
the amount of the net cash proceeds received from this equity issuance would then be applied to increase consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement and on which the covenant calculations are based  for the applicable quarter 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
in addition  beginning in the first quarter of  we are required to make mandatory prepayments on the term loan annually in an amount up to of the prior year s excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement 
mandatory prepayments are applied  in order of maturity  to the scheduled quarterly term loan principal payments

litigation is inherently unpredictable and  although we believe we have valid defenses in these matters based upon advice of counsel  unfavorable resolutions could occur 
while we cannot estimate our range of loss  an adverse outcome from these unresolved proceedings could be material to us with respect to earnings or cash flows in any given reporting period 
we do not believe that the impact of such unresolved litigation would result in a material liability to us in relation to our financial position or liquidity 
we are currently seeking to recover insurance reimbursement for costs incurred to defend the hotel occupancy tax cases 
we recorded a reduction to selling  general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations for reimbursements received of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it meets the following two criteria the policy requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we believe that the estimates and assumptions used when preparing our consolidated financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
we have discussed these estimates with our audit committee 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect our reported results 
although we believe these policies to be the most critical  other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements and certain of these policies may also require the use of estimates and assumptions see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we record revenue based on sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when it is earned and realizable  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record revenue earned net of all amounts paid to our suppliers under both our retail and merchant models  in accordance with the criteria established in emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we offer customers the ability to book airline  hotel  car rental and other travel reservations through our various brands  including orbitz  cheaptickets  ebookers  hotelclub and ratestogo 
these products and services are made available to our customers for booking on a stand alone basis or as part of a dynamic vacation package 
we have two primary types of contractual arrangements with our vendors  which we refer to herein as the retail and merchant models 
under the retail model  we pass reservations booked by our customers to the travel supplier for a commission 
we also charge our customers a service fee for booking the travel reservation 
under this model  we do not take on credit risk with travelers  we are not the primary obligor with the customer  we have no latitude in determining pricing  we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and we have no discretion in the selection of the service supplier 
we recognize net revenue under the retail model when the reservation is made  secured by a customer with a credit card and we have no further obligations to our customers 
for air transactions  this is at the time of booking 
for hotel transactions and car transactions  net revenue is recognized at the time of check in or customer pick up  respectively  net of an allowance for cancelled reservations 
the timing of recognition is different for retail hotel and retail car transactions than for retail air travel because unlike air travel where the reservation is secured by a customer s credit card at booking  car rental bookings and hotel bookings are not secured by a customer s credit card until the pick up date and check in date  respectively 
allowances for cancelled reservations primarily relate to cancellations that do not occur through our website  but instead occur directly through the supplier of the travel product 
the amount of the allowance is determined based on our historical experience 
the majority of commissions earned under the retail model are based upon contractual agreements 
under the merchant model  we provide customers the ability to book the travel reservation  and we contract with various suppliers that provide the travel products needed to fulfill the reservation 
we generate revenue for our services based on the difference between the total amount the customer pays for the travel product and the negotiated net rate plus estimated taxes that the supplier charges for that travel product 
we also charge our customers a service fee for booking the travel reservation 
customers generally pay for reservations in advance  at the time of booking 
initially  we record these advance payments as deferred income and accrued merchant payables 
in this model  we do not take on credit risk with travelers  however we are subject to fraud risk  we have the ability to determine the price  we are not responsible for the actual delivery of the flight  hotel room  or car rental  we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and the customer is responsible for the selection of the service supplier 

table of contents we recognize net revenue under the merchant model when we have no further obligations to our customers 
for merchant air transactions  this is at the time of booking 
for merchant hotel transactions and merchant car transactions  net revenue is recognized at the time of check in or customer pick up  respectively 
this timing is different for merchant air travel because our primary service to the customer is fulfilled at the time of booking 
we accrue for the cost of merchant hotel and merchant car transactions based on amounts we expect to be invoiced by suppliers 
if we do not receive an invoice within a certain period of time  generally within six months  or the invoice received is less than the accrued amount  we may reverse a portion of the accrued cost when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier  based on our historical experience and contract terms 
this would result in an increase in net revenue and a decrease to the accrued merchant payable 
dynamic vacation packages offer customers the ability to book a combination of travel products 
for example  travel products booked in a dynamic vacation package may include a combination of air  hotel and car reservations 
we recognize net revenue for the entire package when customers use the reservation  which generally occurs on the same day for each travel product included in the dynamic vacation package 
under both the retail and merchant models  we recognize revenue for service fees charged to customers for booking travel reservations 
this revenue is recognized at the time we recognize the net revenue for the corresponding travel product 
we also may receive override commissions from suppliers if we meet certain contractual volume thresholds 
these commissions are recognized when the amount of the commissions becomes fixed or determinable  which is generally upon notification by the respective travel supplier 
we utilize gds services provided by galileo  worldspan and amadeus 
under gds service agreements  we earn revenue in the form of an incentive payment for each segment that is processed through a gds 
revenue is recognized for these incentive payments at the time the travel reservation is processed through the gds  which is generally at the time of booking 
we also generate other revenue  which is primarily comprised of revenue from advertising  including sponsoring links on our websites  and travel insurance 
advertising revenue is derived primarily from the delivery of advertisements on our websites and is recognized either at the time of display of each individual advertisement  or ratably over the advertising delivery period  depending on the terms of the advertising contract 
revenues generated from sponsoring links and travel insurance revenue are both recognized upon notification from the alliance partner that a transaction has occurred 
if our judgments regarding net revenue are inaccurate  actual net revenue could differ from the amount we recognize  directly impacting our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets  when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

this analysis is performed by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows to be generated from these assets  on an undiscounted basis 
if this analysis indicates that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable  the carrying value is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations 
the evaluation of long lived assets for impairment requires assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows 
an estimate of future cash flows requires us to assess current and projected market conditions as well as operating performance 
a variation of the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset and could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents goodwill and other intangibles as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently whenever events occur and circumstances change indicating potential impairment 
we perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year  subsequent to the completion of our annual planning process 
we assess goodwill for possible impairment using a two step process 
the first step is used to identify if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if step one indicates that an impairment may exist  a second step is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires management s judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units to which goodwill is allocated using generally accepted valuation methodologies  including market and income based approaches  and relevant data available through and as of the testing date 
the market approach is a valuation method in which fair value is estimated based on observed prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for similar assets 
under the market approach  the valuation process is essentially that of comparison and correlation between the subject asset and other similar assets 
the income approach is a method in which fair value is estimated based on the cash flows that an asset could be expected to generate over its useful life  including residual value cash flows 
these cash flows are then discounted to their present value equivalents using a rate of return that accounts for the relative risk of not realizing the estimated annual cash flows and for the time value of money 
variations of the income approach are used to estimate certain of the intangible asset fair values 
our trademarks and trade names are indefinite lived intangible assets 
we test these assets for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  then the carrying value is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge recorded to our consolidated statement of operations 
we use a market or income valuation approach  as described above  to estimate fair values of the relevant trademarks and trade names 
our testing for impairment involves estimates of our future cash flows  which requires us to assess current and projected market conditions as well as operating performance 
our estimates may differ from actual cash flows due to changes in our operating performance  capital structure or requirements for operating and capital expenditures as well as changes to general economic conditions and the travel industry in particular 
we must also make estimates and judgments in the selection of a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in those future cash flows 
the impairment analysis may also require certain assumptions about other businesses with limited financial histories 
a variation of the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the carrying value of an asset and could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  our provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the combined federal and state effective tax rates that are applicable to us in a given year 
the deferred tax assets are recorded net of a valuation allowance when  based on the weight of available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
increases to the valuation allowance are recorded as increases to the provision for income taxes 
under the current standard  to the extent that any valuation allowances established in purchase accounting are reduced  these reductions are recorded as adjustments to goodwill rather than to the provision for income taxes 
beginning january   these reductions will be recorded through our statement of operations as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r  business combinations 
the realization of the deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance  is primarily dependent on estimated future taxable income 
a change in our estimate of future taxable income may require an increase or decrease to the valuation allowance 

table of contents the predecessor s operations were included in the consolidated us federal income tax return of cendant up to the date of the blackstone acquisition  which occurred on august  in addition  the predecessor has filed consolidated  combined and unitary state income tax returns with cendant in jurisdictions where required or permitted 
however  the provision for income taxes was computed as if the predecessor filed its us federal  state and foreign income tax returns on a standalone basis ie  on a separate company basis 
to the extent that the predecessor s separate company income tax payable  if any  relates to a period in which it was included in cendant s us federal and state income tax returns  any such income tax payable is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
furthermore  the separate company deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the predecessor s operations are based upon estimated differences between the book and tax basis of the assets and liabilities for the predecessor as of august  and prior balance sheet dates 
the successor s deferred tax assets and liabilities may be adjusted in connection with the finalization of cendant s prior years income tax returns  or in connection with the final settlement of the consequences of the separation of cendant into four independent companies 
for the period august  to december   our operations were included in the initial consolidated us federal income tax return of travelport 
in addition  for this period we filed consolidated  combined and unitary state income tax returns with travelport in jurisdictions where required or permitted 
however  the provision for income taxes was computed as if we filed our us federal  state and foreign income tax returns on a separate company basis 
for the period august  to december   we did not have a separate company income tax payable 
for the period january  to february   the operations of travelport were included in the consolidated us federal and state income tax returns for the year ended december  for orbitz worldwide  inc and its subsidiaries 
however  the provision for income taxes was computed as if we filed our us federal  state and foreign income tax returns on a separate company basis without the inclusion of the operations of travelport 
furthermore  the separate company deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated using our tax rates on a separate company basis 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are based upon estimated differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities as of december  our tax assets and liabilities may be adjusted in connection with the ultimate finalization of travelport s income tax returns 
for the year ended december   the provision for us federal  state and foreign income taxes and the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities were based solely on the operations of orbitz worldwide  inc and its subsidiaries 
accounting for tax sharing liability we have a liability included in our consolidated balance sheets that relates to a tax sharing agreement between orbitz and the founding airlines 
the agreement governs the allocation of tax benefits resulting from a taxable exchange that took place in connection with the orbitz initial public offering in december orbitz ipo 
as a result of this taxable exchange  the founding airlines incurred a taxable gain 
the taxable exchange also caused orbitz to have additional future tax deductions for depreciation and amortization due to the increased tax basis of its assets 
the additional tax deductions for depreciation and amortization may reduce the amount of taxes we are required to pay in future years 
for each tax period during the term of the tax sharing agreement  we are obligated to pay the founding airlines a significant percentage of the amount of the tax benefit realized as a result of the taxable exchange 
the tax sharing agreement commenced upon consummation of the orbitz ipo and continues until all tax benefits have been utilized 
we use discounted cash flows in calculating and recognizing the tax sharing liability 
we review the calculation of the tax sharing liability on a quarterly basis and make revisions to our estimated timing of payments when appropriate 
we also assess whether there are any significant changes  such as changes in timing of payments and tax rates  that could materially affect the present value of the tax sharing liability 
although the expected gross remaining payments that may be due under this agreement are million as of december   the timing of payments may change 
any changes in timing of payments are recognized 
table of contents prospectively as accretions to the tax sharing liability in our consolidated balance sheets and interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the valuation of the tax sharing liability requires us to make certain estimates in projecting the quarterly depreciation and amortization benefit we expect to receive  as well as the associated effective income tax rates 
the estimates require certain assumptions as to our future operating performance and taxable income  the tax rate  the timing of tax payments  current and projected market conditions  and the applicable discount rate 
the discount rate assumption is based on our weighted average cost of capital at the time of the blackstone acquisition  which was approximately 
a variation of the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the carrying value of the tax sharing liability and could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
equity based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas no 
r  we measure equity based compensation cost at fair value and recognize the corresponding compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period during which awards are expected to vest 
we include equity based compensation expense in the selling  general and administrative line of our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the average of the high and low price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options is determined on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model  which incorporates a number of variables  some of which are based on estimates and assumptions 
these variables include stock price  exercise price  expected life  expected volatility  dividend yield  and the risk free rate 
stock price and exercise price are set at fair value on the date of grant 
expected volatility is based on implied volatilities for publicly traded options and historical volatility for comparable companies over the estimated expected life of the stock options 
the expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method  as defined in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 shared based payments 
the risk free interest rate is based on yields on us treasury strips with a maturity similar to the estimated expected life of the stock options 
the amount of equity based compensation expense recorded each period is net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures based on historical employee turnover rates  the terms of the award issued and assumptions regarding future employee turnover 
we periodically perform an analysis to determine if estimated forfeitures are reasonable based on actual facts and circumstances  and adjustments are made as necessary 
if our estimates differ significantly from actual results  our consolidated financial statements could be materially affected 
internal use software we capitalize the costs of software developed for internal use in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop and eitf issue no 
 accounting for website development costs 
capitalization commences when the preliminary project stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended 
amortization commences when the software is placed into service 
we also capitalize interest on internal software development projects in accordance with sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  and sop the amount of interest capitalized is computed by applying our weighted average borrowing rate to the average amount of accumulated expenditures in the period 
the determination of costs to be capitalized as well as the useful life of the software requires us to make estimates and judgments

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
transaction exposure we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and payables and forecasted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
we primarily hedge our foreign currency exposure to the british pound  euro and australian dollar 
we do not engage in trading  market making or speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
substantially all of the forward contracts utilized by us do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as a result  any fluctuations in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as incurred 
the fluctuations in the value of these forward contracts do  however  largely offset the impact of changes in the value of the underlying risk that they are intended to economically hedge 
as of december  and december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with net notional values equivalent to approximately million and million  respectively 
translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheets 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and was a net translation loss of million and million  respectively 
this loss is recognized as an adjustment to shareholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk our term loan and revolver bear interest at a variable rate based on libor or an alternative base rate 
we limit interest rate risk associated with the term loan using interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of million as of december  to hedge fluctuations in libor see note derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not engage in trading  market making or speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
sensitivity analysis we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential impact on earnings  fair values  and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in foreign currency rates and interest rates 
we used december  market rates to perform a sensitivity analysis separately for each of our market risk exposures 
the estimates assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we determined  through this analysis  that the potential decrease in net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be million at december  compared to million at december  there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis  primarily due to assumptions that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
the effect of a hypothetical change in market rates of interest on interest expense would be almost nil at december  compared to million at december
