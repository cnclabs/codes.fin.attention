item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we identify and discuss some of the following areas of concern  and provide some discussion as to our plans to protect and exploit our assets and continue to methodically increase our shareholder value 
global oil prices have dropped rapidly from unprecedented mid highs to significantly lower prices at year end 
in poland  all of our gas production is sold to pogc and is tied to published tariffs for gas sold to wholesale consumers that in turn are based in large part on the historical cost of russian imported gas 
with the recent drop in oil prices  there is a possibility that the cost of imported gas may decline  which in turn may cause the polish regulator to decrease the cost of gas sold by pogc and thereby reduce the price pogc pays to us 
we see a greater impact on our revenues and reserves from the declines in oil prices than from changes in gas prices 
year end prices in montana averaged approximately per barrel and reached a monthly high of approximately per barrel in june at year end  our average price in montana was approximately per barrel  and our year end price in poland was approximately per barrel 
the decline in oil prices has the following principal adverse effects o the reduction in oil revenues will impact our ability to execute a robust capital program during o price declines also reduce both the value and the economic volumes of our proved oil reserves in the united states and led to impairment charges at existing wells  where the estimated year end reserve values  calculated at year end prices  are no longer sufficient to cover the existing capitalized costs 
we do not know what impact the distress in the banking industry in general  and on the royal bank of scotland  or rbs  in particular  will have on us 
despite the fact that we believe we have reserve volumes and values that would warrant a sizable increase in this facility in normal economic times  there is no guarantee that rbs will  in fact  increase the amount of funds available to us  which may  in turn  restrict the amount of capital we are able to apply in our development programs in poland 
our stock price has declined more than from its peak and  as of early march  over the preceding months  which may restrict the amount of capital we will be able to apply in our development programs in poland 
because of the circumstances discussed above  we are acutely aware of the need to preserve and be judicious in our use of existing capital and are adjusting our capital and operating budgets 
we are not initiating new capital projects in until the commencement of production at our roszkow well in poland  and we are reducing cash overhead costs by approximately from levels  primarily by reducing compensation and other controllable costs 
the drop in oil prices and the adjusted timing of our capital budget caused us to record property impairment charges during of million related to two of our recent drilling projects in poland due to adjustments in the timing of our capital plans and million related to our producing oil wells in the united states due to lower reserve values 
during the past months  the polish zloty has fluctuated between a low of zlotys per us dollar in august of to a high of zlotys per dollar in late february of as the us dollar strengthens  the us dollar denominated amount of revenue paid in zlotys declines  conversely  when the us dollar weakens  the us dollar denominated amount of revenues paid in zlotys increases 
should exchange rates in effect during early continue throughout the year  we expect the exchange rates to have a negative impact on our us dollar denominated revenues  but a corresponding positive impact on the us dollar cost of our capital expenditures in poland 
during october  we drew down the remaining million available under our senior credit facility and purchased approximately million in polish zloty forward contracts at a rate which  at the time  was a week low for the zloty 
the amount of these forward contracts was matched to our committed capital expenditures in poland 
further  in connection with contracts maturing in the first quarter of  we recorded an additional loss of approximately  when we marked them to market at december   at which time the exchange rate was zlotys per us dollar 
exploration  development and production activities polish exploration rights as of december   we held gas and oil exploration rights in poland in nine separately designated project areas encompassing approximately million gross acres 
we are currently the operator in all areas except our core area  the  gross acres fences project area in which we hold a working interest and in which pogc is the operator 
we own a working interest in approximately million gross acres 
of the remaining approximately million gross acres  we hold approximately million net acres 
as we build revenues in our core area and further explore and evaluate our acreage in poland  we expect to increasingly focus our operational and financial efforts on areas with larger potential reserves 
as we do so  we may add new concessions that we believe have high potential and relinquish acreage that we believe has lower potential 
see wells and acreage below for further information 
exploratory activities in poland our ongoing activities in poland are conducted in nine project areas fences  block  block  northwest  kutno  warsaw south  edge  block  and block our drilling activities are currently focused primarily on the core fences area  where the gas bearing rotliegend sandstone reservoir rock is a direct analog to the southern north sea gas basin offshore the united kingdom 
we are focused on this core area because substantial gas reserves have already been discovered and developed by pogc  we have made five commercial gas discoveries  together with pogc  containing proved gas reserves of over bcf gross bcf net to our interest  and we have concluded that there is likely to be substantial additional natural gas in the same geologic horizon 
we are selling gas from wells located in the fences area and block  and expect to be selling gas in early from a well in block we are developing longer term exploration prospects in the remaining six areas 
fences area the fences concession area is  gross acres  sq 
km 
in western poland s permian basin surrounding pogc s radlin gas field 
the radlin field and several other pogc gas fields located in the fences area are fenced off or excluded from our exploration acreage 
these fields  discovered by pogc between and  produce from structural traps in the rotliegend sandstone 
we hold a interest in approximately  acres and a interest in the remaining  acres in the fences area 
the rotliegend is the primary target horizon throughout most of the fences concession area  at depths from approximately  to  meters 
there are two types of rotliegend traps in the region structural traps and stratigraphic pinch out traps 
both of these trap types are known to produce gas in the region 
in addition  we have identified what appear to be carbonates in the zechstein formation  a third type of trap that is known to produce both gas and oil in the region 
fences area structural traps based on our drilling experience since in the fences area  we have emphasized the use of seismic acquisition  processing  and interpretation techniques that have been used successfully in the rotliegend gas fields of the united kingdom s offshore southern gas basin 
with rotliegend structures as our target  and utilizing improved seismic data processing and acquisition techniques  we have drilled seven wells targeting rotliegend structures through the end of five of these wells are commercial  with aggregate proved gas reserves of over bcf gross bcf net to our interest 
in september  we completed the kromolice well as a commercial success with production anticipated to begin during 
kromolice is located some five kilometers northwest and on the same fault trend as our sroda discovery well 
the natural gas discovery at the kromolice well contributed the greatest portion of our year over year increase in proved reserves 
at year end  gross proved reserves for the well were estimated at approximately bcf of gas bcf net to our interest 
sroda well reserves also increased as the sroda to kromolice trend was determined to be part of a single accumulation 
in november  we suspended drilling operations at the sroda well 
despite the fact that the well drilled meters of good quality rotliegend reservoir rock  removing one of the major uncertainties of the sroda city structure  the well came in significantly structurally low to prognosis and on a drill stem test recovered only gas cut brine 
analysis of the geophysical data from this well  along with existing d seismic data  suggests structural development slightly to the northwest of the sroda well location 
a pre stack depth migration study  which was underway in early  is being carried out at both sroda and regionally to determine the highest point on the sroda structure and to determine whether a higher structural position can be reached by deviating the current well and thereby testing the closure in an optimal location 
as part of our focus on that part of the fences area that is prone to rotliegend structural traps  we have acquired several hundred square kilometers of d seismic data in the area where the kromolice and  sroda  and  and winna gora wells are located and along the trend to the southeast 
processing on this block of seismic data is complete  and the data is being evaluated 
we also acquired approximately kilometers of two dimensional  or d  seismic data over a lead  taczanow  that lies on the trend southeast from the zaniemysl and roszkow wells  our two biggest discoveries to date 
final interpretation of this seismic data is due in finally  in the northernmost part of our fences concession and lying within the area covered by our recent d seismic data  we have identified a very large upthrown block  or horst  of rotliegend sandstone that encompasses approximately square kilometers  or  acres  within our fences concession and continues into the area north of our concession 
one well  the plawce  was drilled by pogc on this rotliegend block within what is now our fences concession 
five other wells have been drilled by others of these more than years ago in this horst block north of our concession boundary 
all six of these wells had substantial gas columns  and all but the most recent well were plugged due to relatively tight reservoir rocks 
the one new well  trzek  located about six kilometers north of our concession  was drilled in and reportedly tested gas at rates between and million cubic feet of natural gas per day  or mmcfd  after high pressure  hydraulic fracturing 
we are continuing to evaluate our data and are working with pogc on a plan to appraise and explore the gas resource in the plawce area 
we acquired square kilometers of d seismic data in that will enhance the quality of our existing d seismic and appraisal data in the plawce area  once the data is interpreted during fences area stratigraphic traps in the southwestern portion of the fences concession there is potential for stratigraphic trapping  or pinch outs  in the rotliegend 
based on data from the rusocin and the lugi wells we drilled in  and based on the presence of wells that produce from stratigraphic traps further to the west from our concession  we believe it is necessary to acquire d seismic data that will help us determine the next steps in exploring the pinch out area 
it is unlikely that we will pursue this play during fences area carbonate reef traps in the northeastern portion of the fences concession we have identified carbonate reef targets in the zechstein ca horizon of the lower permian  just above the rotliegend 
in february  we began drilling the grundy well to test a possible ca reef build up identified on d seismic 
the grundy is located approximately kilometers east of our sroda area 
the nearest significant ca producing fields  the bmb and miedzych d lubiatow grot w gas and oil fields owned by pogc  are located approximately to kilometers northwest of the grundy well and reportedly contain approximately million barrels of oil and bcf of gas 
in september  an open hole dst of the grundy well was completed  testing the rotliegend interval from a depth of  meters to  meters 
during the test  gas shows were recorded without any produced water  but the gas bearing zone appeared to be too tight low porosity or permeability for commercial production without stimulation 
the well has been shut in since that time to allow detailed analysis of drilling  logging  core and dst data  which will take a number of months 
following this analysis  the well may be re entered with a workover rig to conduct high pressure  hydraulic fracturing of the rotliegend intervals with the best reservoir properties 
block concession area the block wilga concession area in east central poland consists of an working interest in approximately  gross acres sq 
km we have one producing well  wilga in block  the result of an exploration project conducted several years ago by us and apache corporation 
as of december   the wilga well had remaining gross proved reserves of approximately bcf of gas and  barrels of light crude oil bcf and  barrels  net to our interest 
in january  we successfully hung a coiled tubing string in the tubing to lift fluids from the well  without a break in production 
we anticipate connecting the wilga well to a medium pressure pipeline during the first quarter of  which will enable us to extend the productive life of the well 
block concession area the block concession area is  acres sq 
km 
located approximately miles south of the fences concession area 
we own of the exploration rights 
block was part of a larger concession area that we relinquished in based on our technical evaluation and on a dry hole that we drilled in within block there are three rotliegend gas wells known as the grabowka wells 
originally drilled by pogc in  these three wells tested gas but never produced commercially 
in early  we entered into a joint venture agreement with an unrelated party  pl energia sa  headquartered in krzywoploty  poland  under which all costs of re entering and completing the three grabowka wells and building production facilities will be paid by our joint venture partner in exchange for discounted pricing on gas 
in june  we successfully re entered the first well  grabowka since that time  production facilities have been constructed  and we expect to see first production from this field in the first half of we plan to monitor the performance of the first well before attempting to recomplete either of the remaining two wells 
we did not have any proved reserves assigned to the grabowka field at year end northwest concession area in  we acquired a interest in a concession in west central poland covering million acres 
the concession is in poland s permian basin directly north of pogc s bmb and miedzych d lubiatow grot w gas and oil fields 
as in our fences concession  the northwest concession has three separate possible exploration models rotliegend sands trapping gas in structural closures  rotliegend sands trapping gas in stratigraphic traps or s  and zechstein ca dolomitic sands  reefs  and talus trapping gas and oil 
during we reviewed the existing sparse  year old geological and geophysical data from the area 
in an area of million acres  there were only about  kilometers of d seismic data and only three wells drilled to target depths 
as a result of this review  we elected to relinquish approximately  acres from the northeast corner of this concession  retaining million acres 
during  we acquired portions of two additional blocks  increasing our acreage to million acres 
we also acquired kilometers of new d seismic data over several of the leads we had identified previously 
in early  we announced that we had reached a preliminary agreement with pogc to explore a portion of the northwest concession area 
plans include drilling one well in definitive agreements are expected to be completed in early  with the well commencing shortly thereafter 
we are seeking industry participation on the remaining blocks  while continuing to carry out early stage exploration work on our own 
kutno concession area in  we acquired a interest in a concession in central poland covering  acres  in  we added additional blocks bringing the total to  acres  sq 
km the area encompasses a rotliegend mega structure kutno with projected four way dip closure 
depth of the structure is estimated at approximately  meters  feet 
in view of the depth and cost  we are seeking industry participation to drill kutno 
warsaw south concession area in  we acquired a interest in several concession blocks in east central poland  in  we dropped two of the blocks  leaving a total of  acres  sq 
km the warsaw south concession has several possible exploration opportunities  including carboniferous sands with structural or truncation trapping and zechstein reefs trapped by overlying evaporates and salt 
our technical group has reviewed the geological and geophysical data from the area and identified a dozen carboniferous leads and two possible zechstein reef targets 
we are seeking industry participation while continuing to carry out early stage exploration work on our own 
edge concession area in  we acquired a interest in four concessions in north central poland covering approximately  acres  sq 
km having reprocessed existing d seismic data  we identified a number of leads including several permian age ca reefs and a large devonian structure 
we are soliciting industry support to shoot additional seismic and drill two or more exploratory wells to confirm the plays 
block concession area in  we acquired a interest in a concession in west central poland covering approximately  acres sq 
km block is contiguous with the southwest corner of the fences concession and appears to have rotliegend potential 
we are reprocessing existing d seismic data to identify possible leads 
block concession area in  we acquired a interest in a concession east of our fences project area covering approximately  acres sq 
km we have identified a number of possible ca reef build ups on d seismic in block we plan to seek industry participation while continuing to carry out early stage exploration work on our own 
additional concession acreage we may apply for more concession blocks in poland in we will allocate modest technical and financial resources to these areas during  primarily in the form of data collection and seismic reprocessing  with a view to ascertaining relative hydrocarbon potential and exploration risk 
activities and assets in the united states nevada during  we drilled one shallow dry hole in nevada 
we may drill one well in on land that is near our existing producing properties

item a 
risk factors risk factors our business is subject to a number of material risks  including  but not limited to  the following factors related directly and indirectly to our business activities in the united states and poland 
risks relating to our business our success depends largely on our discovery of economic quantities of gas or oil in poland 
we currently have a limited amount of production in poland and the united states 
our production volumes vary significantly because the limited number of producing wells in poland makes our total production sensitive to individual well performance  as evidenced by the production volume declines during in poland  where production from our wilga well declined substantially below previous levels 
we anticipate that our production will increase in as previously drilled wells are placed into production and that we will generate revenues in excess of direct lease operating costs 
however  these revenues are not expected to be sufficient to cover all of our exploration and development costs 
accordingly  we will continue to rely on existing working capital  including borrowings under our senior credit facility with rbs  and additional funds obtained from external sources  including industry partners  to cover these costs 
our development efforts in poland may be limited by the unavailability of additional borrowings 
we have drawn the entire million available under our senior credit facility with rbs 
this credit facility is based on rbs s evaluation of our reserves in poland as of november when we established the facility 
our reserves have increased substantially since establishing the credit facility with rbs  and we expect our reserve values to continue to increase if we make additional discoveries and as we place other wells into production 
we believe a sizeable increase in our credit facility would be warranted but for the current global economic crisis 
due to extreme shortages of capital and liquidity  rbs  which had a market capitalization of over billion two years ago  now has a market capitalization of less than billion 
after equity infusions aggregating about billion during the last year  rbs will now be between and owned by the united kingdom government and is undergoing substantial management and staff reorganization 
accordingly  we cannot predict how rbs will respond to requests for increased borrowings  notwithstanding our compliance with the terms of our credit facility agreement and substantial increases in reserve quantities and values 
in view of the current global banking and economic crisis  there is a severe shortage of available capital for project financing in general  and we have no other established borrowing relationships with banks or other sources of project financing 
therefore  we cannot assure that we can obtain borrowings from other sources to supplement or replace our current credit facility with rbs 
our inability to expand our borrowings would restrict the amount of capital we are able to apply in our development programs in poland 
the over decline in our stock price from its high and the prevailing condition in the equity markets make additional equity financing currently unlikely 
our stock price has declined more than from its peak and  as of early march  over the preceding months 
these price declines are typical throughout the equity markets generally and in the gas and oil segment specifically 
in these market conditions we cannot assure that the equity markets will be accessible or that we would be willing to sell equity at the prices that may be required in order to attract capital 
the recent sharp decline in global oil prices below mid unprecedented highs could have a future negative impact on the price we receive for gas in poland 
global oil prices have dropped rapidly from unprecedented mid highs to lower prices at year end  and gas prices in the united states have also decreased significantly 
the decline in world oil prices may  in the future  depress the prices at which we sell gas in poland to pogc pursuant to published tariffs for gas sold to wholesale consumers 
such tariffs are determined in part by reference to the cost of russian imported gas  which in turn is priced based on trailing  historical oil prices 
the trailing impact of such lower prices may influence tariff price reductions and so may reduce the price that we may receive for our gas from pogc 
declining oil prices have a direct impact on our domestic revenues 
the fall in oil prices means our oil revenues will decline until such time as prices recover 
declining oil prices resulted in property impairments of million related to our domestic producing properties during  and further impairments of the remaining million would be likely in the event of further price declines 
we may incur additional losses due to exchange rate fluctuations 
continuing fluctuations in the rates at which us dollars are exchanged into polish zlotys may result in exchange rate losses in addition to the approximately  in losses related to open polish forward contracts that we recognized at december  increases in the exchange rate above the rate of zlotys per dollar at december   would result in additional losses during the current quarter 
we could also suffer additional future losses if we purchase new forward contracts in an effort to protect against further exchange rate fluctuations 
we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations as we transfer dollar denominated funds from the united states to poland for exploration and development and receive payment for the gas we sell in poland in zlotys 
we record receivables and payables in us dollars and recognize a gain or loss when the receivables or payables are subsequently settled at different exchange rates 
as the us dollar strengthens  our us dollar denominated revenue received in polish zlotys declines  conversely  when the us dollar weakens  our us dollar denominated revenue received in polish zlotys increases 
should exchange rates in effect during early continue throughout the year  we expect the exchange rates to have a negative impact on our us dollar denominated revenues  but a corresponding positive impact on the us dollar cost of our capital expenditures in poland 
we have limited control over our exploration and development activities in poland 
our partner  pogc  holds the majority interest and is operator of our fences project area and has a minority interest in our wilga project area 
as a paying partner  we rely to a significant extent on the financial capabilities of pogc 
if pogc were to fail to perform its obligations under contracts with us  it would most likely have a material adverse effect on us 
in particular  we have prepared our exploration budget through and beyond based on the participation of and funding to be provided by pogc 
although we have rights to participate in exploration and development activities on some pogc controlled acreage  we have limited rights to initiate such activities 
further  we have no direct interest in some of the underlying agreements  licenses  and grants from the polish agencies governing the exploration  exploitation  development  or production of acreage controlled by pogc 
thus  our program in poland involving pogc controlled acreage would be adversely affected if pogc should elect not to pursue activities on such acreage  if the relationship between us and pogc should deteriorate or terminate  or if pogc or the governmental agencies should fail to fulfill the requirements of  or elect to terminate  such agreements  licenses  or grants 
we cannot assure the exploration models we are using in poland will lead to finding gas or oil in poland 
we cannot assure the exploration models we and pogc have developed will provide a useful or effective guide for selecting exploration prospects and drilling targets 
we will have to revise or replace these exploration models as a guide to further exploration if ongoing drilling results do not confirm their validity 
these exploration models may be based on incomplete or unconfirmed data and theories that have not been fully tested 
the seismic data  other technologies  and the study of producing fields in the area do not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling that gas or oil will be present in commercial quantities 
the fact that some prospects may appear to have similar geological or geophysical subsurface features or may be located in proximity to previous wells cannot assure that such prospects are in fact similar or that drilling results will be comparable 
every prospect must be evaluated individually 
we cannot assure that the analogies that we draw from available data from other wells  more fully explored prospects  or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects 
we use various methods to evaluate various categories of potential gas or oil accumulations 
this report contains estimates of quantities and values of proved reserves as estimated in accordance with deterministic methods and criteria established by the securities and exchange commission 
we also use probabilistic methods commonly used in europe and other parts of the world for estimating the quantity and value of gas and oil accumulations for various purposes  including determining the amount that we may borrow under our senior credit facility with rbs 
for purposes of management decisions and risk analysis  we use other geological and geophysical techniques to determine gross  unrisked resource potential 
these various methods are important in making many kinds of management decisions at various stages during the exploration  development  and production process  but the quantities and values arrived at through these various methods are not comparable and should not be compared 
we cannot assure that any gas or oil quantities or values that we estimate using probabilistic methods will ever be converted through additional exploration and production into pv values estimated in accordance with deterministic methods required by the securities and exchange commission 
we cannot accurately predict the size of exploration targets or foresee all related risks 
notwithstanding the accumulation and study of d and d seismic data  drilling logs  production information from established fields  and other data  we cannot predict accurately the gas or oil potential of individual prospects and drilling targets or the related risks 
we sometimes predict the gross potential gas or oil in a particular area as part of our evaluation of the exploration potential and related risks 
our predictions are only rough  preliminary geological estimates of the forecasted volume and characteristics of possible reservoirs and the calculated potential gas or oil that could be contained if present and are unqualified by any risk evaluation 
such forecasts are not an assurance that our exploration will be successful or that we will be able to establish reserves equal to such forecasts 
in some cases  our estimates may be based on a review of data from other exploration or producing fields in the area that ultimately may be found not to be similar to our exploration prospects 
we may require several test wells and long term analysis of test data and history of production to determine the gas or oil potential of individual prospects 
we have had limited exploratory success in poland 
since  we have participated in drilling exploratory wells in poland  including seven commercial discoveries the wilga  kleka  zaniemysl  sroda  winna gora  roszkow  and kromolice  and noncommercial wells 
of our seven commercial successes in poland  we were producing gas at our wilga  zaniemysl  and kleka wells as of december  we may not achieve the results anticipated in placing our current or future discoveries into production 
we may encounter delays in commencing the production and the sale of gas in poland  including our recent gas discoveries and other possible future discoveries 
the possible delays may arise in obtaining rights of way to connect to the pogc pipeline system  obtaining construction permits  availability of materials and contractors  the signing of gas or oil purchase sales contracts  and other factors 
such delays would correspondingly delay the commencement of cash flow and may require us to obtain additional short term financing pending commencement of production 
further  we may design proposed surface and pipeline facilities based on possible estimated results of additional drilling 
we cannot assure that additional drilling will establish additional reserves or production that will provide an economic return for planned expenditures for facilities 
we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing a particular discovery into production are higher  if the project is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
privatization nationalization of pogc could affect our relationship and future opportunities in poland 
our activities in poland have benefited from our relationship with pogc  which has provided us with exploration acreage  seismic data  and production data under our agreements 
the polish government commenced the privatization of pogc by selling pogc s refining assets in the mid s and by successfully completing an initial public offering of approximately of its stock 
complete privatization or a re nationalization of pogc may result in new policies  strategies  or ownership that could adversely affect our existing relationship and agreements  as well as the availability of opportunities with pogc in the future 
we have a history of operating losses and may require additional capital in the future to fund our operations 
from our inception in january through december   we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
we expect that our exploration and production activities may continue to result in net losses through and possibly beyond  depending on whether our activities in poland and the united states result in sufficient revenues to cover related operating expenses 
until sufficient cash flow from operations can be obtained  we expect we will need additional capital to fully fund our ongoing planned exploration  appraisal  development  and property acquisition programs in poland 
we may seek required funds from the issuance of additional debt  equity or hybrid securities  project financing  strategic alliances  or other arrangements 
obtaining additional financing may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project being financed 
we cannot assure that additional funds could be obtained or  if obtained  would be on terms favorable to us 
in addition to planned activities in poland  we may require additional funds for general corporate purposes 
the loss of key personnel could have an adverse impact on our operations 
we rely on our officers  key employees  and consultants and their expertise  particularly david n 
pierce  president and chief executive officer  thomas b 
lovejoy  chairman of the board and executive vice president  andrew w 
pierce  vice president operations  jerzy b 
maciolek  vice president exploration  zbigniew tatys  poland country manager  and richard hardman  director and chairman of our technical and advisory panel 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals may materially and adversely affect us 
we have entered into employment agreements with our key executives 
we do not maintain key man insurance on any of our employees 
substantially all of the gas and oil currently produced in poland is sold to a single customer or its affiliates 
we currently sell substantially all of the gas and oil produced in poland to pogc or one of its affiliates 
if pogc were to fail to perform its obligations under contracts with us  it would most likely have a material adverse effect on us 
as discussed previously  the market for the sale of gas in poland is open to competition  but there are not yet many participants 
while our contracts provide us with the ability to market gas to other purchasers  including those outside of poland  it may take a considerable amount of time to replace pogc as our primary customer 
gas and oil price decreases and volatility could adversely affect our operations and our ability to obtain financing 
gas and oil prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors the market and price structure in local markets  changes in the supply of and demand for gas and oil  market uncertainty  political conditions in international gas and oil producing regions  the extent of production and importation of gas and oil into existing or potential markets  the level of consumer demand  weather conditions affecting production  transportation  and consumption  the competitive position of gas or oil as a source of energy  as compared with coal  nuclear energy  hydroelectric power  and other energy sources  the availability  proximity  and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines  and processing facilities  the refining and processing capacity of prospective gas or oil purchasers  the effect of governmental regulation on the production  transportation  and sale of gas and oil  and other factors beyond our control 
we have not entered into any agreements to protect us from price fluctuations and may or may not do so in the future 
our industry is subject to numerous operating risks 
insurance may not be adequate to protect us against all these risks 
our gas and oil drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry 
these hazards include blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  pollution  releases of toxic gas  and other environmental hazards and risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage  and suspension of operations 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our domestic and international operations 
we cannot assure that the insurance policies carried by us or by pogc  as operator of the fences area  can continue to be obtained on reasonable terms 
while we do carry limited third party liability and all risk insurance in poland  we do not plan to purchase well control insurance on wells we drill in the fences project area and may elect not to purchase such insurance on wells drilled in other areas in poland as well 
the current level of insurance does not cover all of the risks involved in gas and oil exploration  drilling  and production 
where additional insurance coverage does exist  the amount of coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full amount of such liabilities 
we may not be insured against all losses or liabilities that may arise from all hazards because such insurance is unavailable at economic rates  because of limitations on existing insurance coverage  or other factors 
for example  we do not maintain insurance against risks related to violations of environmental laws 
we would be adversely affected by a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance 
further  we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
risks relating to conducting business in poland polish laws  regulations  and policies may be changed in ways that could adversely impact our business 
our gas and oil exploration  development  and production activities in poland are and will continue to be subject to ongoing uncertainties and risks  including possible changes in government personnel  the development of new administrative policies  and practices and political conditions in poland that may affect the administration of agreements with governmental agencies or enterprises  possible changes to the laws  regulations  and policies applicable to us and our partners or the gas and oil industry in poland in general  uncertainties as to whether the laws and regulations will be applicable in any particular circumstance  uncertainties as to whether we will be able to enforce our rights in poland  uncertainty as to whether we will be able to demonstrate  to the satisfaction of the polish authorities  our and pogc s compliance with governmental requirements respecting exploration expenditures  results of exploration  environmental protection matters  and other factors  the inability to recover previous payments to the polish government made under the exploration rights or any other costs incurred respecting those rights if we were to lose or cancel our exploration and exploitation rights at any time  political instability and possible changes in government  export and transportation tariffs  local and national tax requirements  expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises and other risks arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our acreage in poland  and possible significant delays in obtaining opinions of local authorities or satisfying other governmental requirements in connection with a grant of permits to conduct exploration and production activities 
poland has a developing regulatory regime  regulatory policies  and interpretations 
poland has a regulatory regime governing exploration and development  production  marketing  transportation  and storage of gas and oil 
these provisions were promulgated during the past two decades and are relatively untested 
therefore  there is little or no administrative or enforcement history or established practice that can aid us in evaluating how the regulatory regime will affect our operations 
it is possible those governmental policies will change or that new laws and regulations  administrative practices or policies  or interpretations of existing laws and regulations will materially and adversely affect our activities in poland 
for example  poland s laws  policies  and procedures were changed to conform to the requirements that had to be met before poland was admitted as a full member of the european union 
our gas and oil operations are subject to changing environmental laws and regulations that could have a negative impact on our operations 
operations on our project areas are subject to environmental laws and regulations in poland that provide for restrictions and prohibitions on spills  releases  or emissions of various substances produced in association with gas and oil exploration and development 
additionally  if significant quantities of gas are produced with oil  regulations prohibiting the flaring of gas may inhibit oil production 
in such circumstances  the absence of a gas gathering and delivering system may restrict production or may require significant expenditures to develop such a system prior to producing gas and oil 
we are required to prepare and obtain approval of environmental impact assessments by governmental authorities in poland prior to commencing gas or oil production  transportation  and processing functions 
we are also subject to the requirements of natura  which is an ecological network in the territory of the european union 
in may  governments of the european union adopted legislation designed to protect the most seriously threatened habitats and species across europe 
we and our partners cannot assure that we have complied with all applicable laws and regulations in drilling wells  acquiring seismic data  or completing other activities in poland to date 
the polish government may adopt more restrictive regulations or administrative policies or practices 
the cost of compliance with current regulations or any changes in environmental regulations could require significant expenditures 
further  breaches of such regulations may result in the imposition of fines and penalties  any of which may be material 
these environmental costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows in the future 
certain risks of loss arise from our need to conduct transactions in foreign currency 
the amounts in our agreements relating to our activities in poland are sometimes expressed and payable in us dollars and sometimes in polish zlotys 
conversions between us dollars and polish zlotys are typically made on the date amounts are paid or received 
in the future  our financial results and cash flows in poland may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the polish zloty and the us dollar 
currencies used by us may not be convertible at satisfactory rates 
in addition  the official conversion rates between united states and polish currencies may not accurately reflect the relative value of goods and services available or required in poland 
further  inflation may lead to the devaluation of the polish zloty 
the interests that we hold in concessions and usufructs owned in the name of pogc may be jeopardized or lost  without compensation to us  in the event of pogc s bankruptcy  persistent breaches of laws such as environmental requirements  winding up  or other circumstances 
the poland ministry of the environment  which administers the geologic and mining law  has the authority to terminate concessions and usufructs in the name of pogc and in which we have a fractional undivided interest if pogc is declared bankrupt  persistently violates environmental regulations or other laws  is wound up  rescinds the concession  or otherwise breaches material usufruct or concession terms 
there can be no assurance that pogc s current government ownership will continue or that the poland government will in any circumstance intervene to prevent pogc s insolvency or bankruptcy 
we may not be able to implement effective measures to preserve and protect our property interests by curing any concession or usufruct default by pogc  assuring fair compensation in the event of any such loss  or implementing new legal strategies that would insulate our interests from loss due to pogc s actions or condition 
risks related to an investment in our common stock our stockholder rights plan and bylaws discourage unsolicited takeover proposals and could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on our common stock 
we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors 
in addition  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that our stockholders may consider to be in their best interests that include provisions that members of the board of directors are elected and retire in rotation  and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of  and to issue new series of  preferred shares 
together  these provisions and our stockholder rights plan may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment to our stockholders of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common shares 
our common stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile 
our common stock has traded as low as and as high as during intraday trading between january   and the date of this report 
some of the factors leading to this volatility include the outcome of individual wells or the timing of exploration efforts in poland  the potential sale by us of newly issued common stock to raise capital or by existing stockholders of restricted securities  price and volume fluctuations in the general securities markets that are unrelated to our results of operations  the investment community s view of companies with assets and operations outside the united states in general and in poland in particular  actions or announcements by pogc that may affect us  turmoil in the financial sector which may impact our revolving credit facility  prevailing world prices for gas and oil  the potential of our current and planned activities in poland  and changes in stock market analysts recommendations regarding us  other gas and oil companies  or the gas and oil industry in general 
exploration failures in poland may adversely affect the trading prices for our common stock

item properties proved reserves proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reserves under existing economic and operating conditions 
our proved gas and oil reserve quantities and values are based on estimates prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
operating costs  production taxes  and development costs were deducted in determining the quantity and value information 
such costs were estimated based on current costs and were not adjusted to anticipate increases due to inflation or other factors 
no price escalations were assumed  and no amounts were deducted for general overhead  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and interest expense 
the proved reserve quantity and value information is based on the weighted average price on december   of per barrel of oil  or bbl  and per thousand cubic feet  or mcf  of gas in poland and per bbl for oil in the united states 
the determination of gas and oil reserves is based on estimates and is highly complex and interpretive  as there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves  projecting future rates of production  and the timing and amount of development expenditures

poland has a network of gas pipelines and crude oil pipelines traversing the country serving major metropolitan  commercial  industrial  and gas production areas  including significant portions of our acreage 
poland has a well developed infrastructure of hard surfaced roads and railways over which oil produced can be transported for sale 
there are refineries in gdansk and plock in poland and one in germany near the western polish border that we believe could process crude oil produced in poland 
should we choose to export any gas or oil we produce  we will be required to obtain prior governmental approval 
we are currently selling substantially all of our gas and oil production in poland to pogc or one of its affiliates 
gas is sold pursuant to long term sales contracts  typically for the life of each well  which obligate pogc to purchase all gas produced

the republic of poland the republic of poland is located in central europe  has a population of approximately million people  and covers an area comparable in size to new mexico 
during  poland peacefully asserted its independence and became a parliamentary democracy 
since  poland has enacted comprehensive economic reform programs and stabilization measures that have enabled it to form a free market economy and turn its economic ties from the east to the west  with most of its current international trade with the countries of the european union and the united states 
the economy has undergone extensive restructuring in the post communist era 
the polish government credits foreign investment as a forceful growth factor in successfully creating a stable  free market economy 
since its transition to a free market economy and a parliamentary democracy  poland has experienced significant economic growth and political change 
poland has developed and is refining legal  tax  and regulatory systems characteristic of parliamentary democracies with interpretation and procedural safeguards 
the polish government has taken steps to harmonize polish legislation with that of the european union  which it joined in may of poland has created an attractive legal framework and fiscal regime for gas and oil exploration by actively encouraging investment by foreign companies 
in july  poland s council of ministers approved a program to restructure and privatize the polish petroleum sector 
so far under this plan  a refinery located in plock has been privatized as a publicly held company with its stock trading on the london and warsaw stock exchanges 
in september of  pogc sold of its stock in an initial public offering on the warsaw stock exchange  raising a total of billion polish zlotys approximately us million 
prior to becoming a parliamentary democracy during  the exploration and development of poland s gas and oil resources were hindered by a combination of foreign influence  a centrally controlled economy  limited financial resources  and a lack of modern exploration technology 
as a result of these and other factors  poland is currently a net energy importer 
oil is imported primarily from countries of the former soviet union and the middle east  and gas is imported primarily from russia 
legal framework general usufruct and concession terms all of our rights in poland have been awarded to us or to pogc pursuant to the geological and mining law  which specifies the process for obtaining domestic exploration and exploitation rights 
under the geological and mining law  the concession authority enters into mining usufruct lease agreements that grant the holder the exclusive right to explore for gas and oil in a designated area or to exploit the designated oil and or gas field for a specified period under prescribed terms and conditions 
the holder of the mining usufruct covering exploration must also acquire an exploration concession by applying to the concession authority and providing the opportunity for comment by local governmental authorities 
the usufruct agreements include provisions that give the usufruct holder a claim for an extension of the usufruct and the underlying concession  subject to having fulfilled all obligations under the usufruct and or concession agreements 
under current law  the concession authority requires that concessions and related usufructs be owned by a single entity  without recognizing any minority record ownership such as would reflect our interest in those areas in which we previously have been granted a minority ownership 
as such  our ownership is subject to continued compliance with applicable law  the usufruct and concession terms  and  with regards to the fences area  the solvency of pogc as the record owner 
the concession authority has granted pogc gas and oil exploration rights on the fences project area  and has granted us gas and oil exploration rights on all other project areas in which we have an interest 
the agreements divide these areas into blocks  containing up to  acres 
if commercially viable gas or oil is discovered  the concession owner may produce it for two years based on the exploration concession  then apply for an exploitation concession  as provided by the usufructs  generally with a term of to years or as long as commercial production continues 
upon the grant of the exploitation concession  the concession owner may become obligated to pay a fee  to be negotiated  but expected to be less than of the market value of the estimated recoverable reserves in place 
the concession owner would also be required to pay a royalty on any production  the amount of which will be set by the council of ministers  within a range established by legislation for the mineral being extracted 
the royalty rate for high methane gas is currently less than per mcf 
local governments will receive of any royalties paid on production 
the holder of the exploitation concession must also acquire rights to use the land from the surface owner and could be subject to significant delays in obtaining the consents of local authorities or satisfying other governmental requirements prior to obtaining an exploitation concession 
we believe all material concession terms have been satisfied to date 
existing project areas fences project area the fences project area consists of four gas and oil exploration concessions controlled by pogc 
three producing fields radlin  kleka  and kaleje lie within the concession boundary  but are excluded from the fences concessions 
the concessions have expiration dates ranging from july to july the total remaining work commitment includes acquiring kilometers of d seismic data  square kilometers of d seismic data  and drilling three wells 
pogc has filed an application for an extension for the concession expiring in  which we expect to be granted

government regulation poland our activities in poland are subject to political  economic  and other uncertainties  including the adoption of new laws  regulations  or administrative policies that may adversely affect us or the terms of our exploration or production rights  political instability and changes in government or public or administrative policies  export and transportation tariffs and local and national taxes  foreign exchange and currency restrictions and fluctuations  repatriation limitations  inflation  environmental regulations  and other matters 
these operations in poland are subject to the geological and mining law dated as of september  as amended  and the protection and management of the environment act dated as of january  as amended  which are the current primary statutes governing environmental protection 
agreements with the government of poland respecting our exploration and production areas create certain standards to be met regarding environmental protection 
participants in gas and oil exploration  development  and production activities generally are required to adhere to good international petroleum industry practices  including practices relating to the protection of the environment  and prepare and submit geological work plans  with specific attention to environmental matters  to the appropriate agency of state geological administration for its approval prior to engaging in field operations such as seismic data acquisition  exploratory drilling  and field wide development 
poland s regulatory framework respecting environmental protection is not as fully developed and detailed as that which exists in the united states 
we intend to conduct our operations in poland in accordance with good international petroleum industry practices and  as they continue to develop  polish requirements 
united states state and local regulation of drilling and production our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state  and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of gas and oil properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from gas and oil wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas  and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
our oil production is affected to some degree by state regulations 
states in which we operate have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of gas and oil  including provisions regarding deliverability 
such statutes and related regulations are generally intended to prevent waste of gas and oil and to protect correlative rights to produce gas and oil between owners of a common reservoir 
certain state regulatory authorities also regulate the amount of gas and oil produced by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit 
environmental regulations the federal government and various state and local governments have adopted laws and regulations regarding the control of contamination of the environment 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit by operators before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities  and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands  and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
these laws and regulations may also increase the costs of drilling and operating wells 
we may also be held liable for the costs of removal and damages arising out of a pollution incident to the extent set forth in the federal water pollution control act  as amended by the oil pollution act of  or opa in addition  we may be subject to other civil claims arising out of any such incident 
as with any owner of property  we are also subject to clean up costs and liability for hazardous materials  asbestos  or any other toxic or hazardous substance that may exist on or under any of our properties 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws  rules  and regulations and that continued compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
furthermore  we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than our competitors in the gas and oil industry 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances 
under cercla  such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources  and for the costs of certain health studies 
furthermore  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  and regulations promulgated thereunder govern the generation  storage  transfer  and disposal of hazardous wastes 
rcra  however  excludes from the definition of hazardous wastes drilling fluids  produced waters  and other wastes associated with the exploration  development  or production of crude oil  gas  or geothermal energy 
because of this exclusion  many of our operations are exempt from rcra regulation 
nevertheless  we must comply with rcra regulations for any of our operations that do not fall within the rcra exclusion 
the opa and related regulations impose a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills 
opa establishes strict liability for owners of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the united states 
while opa liability more typically applies to facilities near substantial bodies of water  at least one district court has held that opa liability can attach if the contamination could enter waters that may flow into navigable waters 
stricter standards in environmental legislation may be imposed on the gas and oil industry in the future  such as proposals made in congress and at the state level from time to time  that would reclassify certain gas and oil exploration and production wastes as hazardous wastes and make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling  disposal  and clean up requirements 
the impact of any such changes  however  would not likely be any more burdensome to us than to any other similarly situated company involved in gas and oil exploration and production 
federal and indian leases a substantial part of our producing properties in montana consists of gas and oil leases issued by the bureau of land management or by the blackfeet tribe under the supervision of the bureau of indian affairs 
our activities on these properties must comply with rules and orders that regulate aspects of the gas and oil industry  including drilling and operating on leased land and the calculation and payment of royalties to the federal government or the governing indian nation 
our operations on indian lands must also comply with applicable requirements of the governing body of the tribe involved including  in some instances  the employment of tribal members 
we believe we are currently in full compliance with all material provisions of such regulations 
safety and health regulations we must also conduct our operations in accordance with various laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health 
currently  we do not foresee expending material amounts to comply with these occupational safety and health laws and regulations 
however  since such laws and regulations are frequently changed  we are unable to predict the future effect of these laws and regulations 
title to properties we rely on sovereign ownership of exploration rights and mineral interests by the polish government in connection with our activities in poland and have not conducted and do not plan to conduct any independent title examination 
we regularly consult with our polish legal counsel when doing business in poland 
nearly all of our united states working interests are held under leases from third parties 
we typically obtain a title opinion concerning such properties prior to the commencement of drilling operations 
we have obtained such title opinions or other third party review on all of our producing properties  and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all such properties sufficient to meet standards generally accepted in the gas and oil industry 
our united states properties are subject to typical burdens  including customary royalty interests and liens for current taxes  but we have concluded that such burdens do not materially interfere with the use of such properties 
further  we believe the economic effects of such burdens have been appropriately reflected in our acquisition cost of such properties and reserve estimates 
title investigation before the acquisition of undeveloped properties is less thorough than that conducted prior to drilling  as is standard practice in the industry 
employees and consultants as of december   we had employees  consisting of nine in salt lake city  utah  in oilmont  montana  one in greenwich  connecticut  three in houston  texas  and twelve in poland 
our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory 
we also regularly engage technical consultants to provide specific geological  geophysical  and other professional services 
our executive officers and other management employees regularly travel to poland to supervise activities conducted by our staff and others under contract on our behalf 
offices and facilities our corporate offices  located at highland drive  salt lake city  utah  contain approximately  square feet and are rented at  per month under a month to month agreement 
in montana  we own a  square foot building located at the corner of central and main in oilmont 
we also have an office in warsaw  poland  located at ul 
chalubinskiego  which we rent for approximately  per month

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
introduction as a result of the very different characteristics of our two major operating areas poland and united states  our financial results show a distinct dichotomy 
our polish operations are still early in their development and growth phase  while our us operations are relatively mature 
beginning in  our results began to show substantial changes and improvement as we began gas and oil production in poland 
see results of operations by business segment below 
through  most of our gas and oil production  revenues  and lease operating expenses were attributable to our us operations 
our oilfield service revenues and costs have been and will continue to be exclusively from the united states 
our us operations have historically been the source of essentially all of our operating cash flow 
these operations are relatively stable  with only modest growth or decline on an annual basis 
most of our exploration costs during the past several years have been attributable to our efforts in poland 
we expect our polish operations will continue to represent the bulk of our exploration costs  reflecting the nature of our exploration efforts there 
we are acutely aware of the global economic crisis and we are mindful of the need to stay alert and act reasonably 
we believe our business strategy is sound and that our resources and opportunities  carefully managed  will allow us to continue growing through the next several years 
following is a brief discussion concerning certain significant operational and capital events that occurred during and the first quarter of  as well as discussion concerning the impact of the current world economic situation on us 
gas and oil reserves as a result of our ongoing drilling and production successes in poland  was the fifth consecutive year that we reported record year end proved reserve values 
the following table highlights year end reserve volumes and values  and shows the change from to change proved reserve volumes in thousands gas reserves mcf oil reserves bbls total reserves mcfe proved reserve values reserves pv value the natural gas discovery at the kromolice well contributed the greatest portion of our year over year increase in proved reserves 
at year end  gross proved reserves for the well were estimated at approximately bcf of gas bcf net to our interest 
the sroda well proved reserves also increased by bcf as the sroda to kromolice trend was determined to be part of a single accumulation 
a increase in zaniemysl proved reserves of bcf following a reservoir test was also a positive development 
in early  we announced the successful drilling of the kromolice well  located two kilometers southwest of the kromolice well 
the well flowed gas on a successful dst and is being completed for production 
reserves from the kromolice well will be included in our reserve report  and will likely enable us to report record reserve values for a sixth consecutive year 
adapting to the global economic crisis the impact on the gas and oil industry of the current global economic crisis has been sudden  dramatic  and wide ranging 
as with the bulk of companies in this industry  we are not immune from many of the negative effects 
in the following paragraphs  we identify some of the areas of concern  and provide some discussion as to our plans to protect and exploit our assets and continue to methodically increase our shareholder value 
gas and oil prices 
global oil prices have dropped rapidly from unprecedented highs in mid to significantly lower prices at year end 
gas prices in the united states have also decreased significantly 
the european gas market  however  operates quite differently than the domestic market 
in poland  all of our gas production is sold to pogc and is tied to published tariffs set by the public utility regulator from time to time for gas sold to wholesale consumers 
during  the polish regulator granted two price increases  the first in april and the second in october 
since that time  gas prices have remained constant 
a major component of the tariff calculation is the cost of russian imported gas  which in turn is priced based on trailing  historical oil prices 
with the recent drop in oil prices  there is a possibility that the cost of imported gas may decline  which in turn may cause the polish regulator to decrease the cost of gas sold by pogc and thereby reduce the price we receive 
the other major component of the tariff calculation is the cost of gas provided by pogc itself 
historically  this cost has been low  reflecting the relatively low cost of finding and producing domestic gas 
natural gas prices in poland are  and for years have been  below european union average prices for both households and industry  because the prices have been subsidized by the government 
european union rules require poland to abandon market subsidies and bring poland gas prices to free market levels 
this may act as a cushion against possible declines in prices 
as of year end  gas prices in poland remained firm and were higher than those of an equivalent btu content in the united states 
there was no significant price impact on the value and volumes of our gas reserves in poland from to we see a greater impact on our revenues and reserves from the declines in oil prices than from changes in gas prices 
year end prices in montana averaged approximately per barrel and reached a monthly high of approximately per barrel in june at year end  our average price in montana was approximately per barrel  and our year end price in poland was approximately per barrel 
the fall in oil prices creates two primary issues first  oil revenues will decrease significantly until such time as prices recover 
in our case  more than of our gas and oil revenues were from our gas wells in poland  so the impact of lower oil prices on revenues  while measurable  will be lessened somewhat by our production mix and expected increases in gas production in poland 
the reduction in oil revenues will  however  impact our ability to execute a robust capital program during see capital and operating budgets below for more discussion 
second  the price decline reduces both the value and volumes of our proved oil reserves in the united states 
this  in turn  leads to impairment charges at existing wells  where the estimated year end reserve values  calculated at year end prices  are now less than the existing capitalized costs 
see property impairments below for more discussion 
we expect this type of charge to be commonplace among most gas and oil companies this year 
in our case  domestic oil properties accounted for only of our total reserve value at year end again  the impact on reserve volumes and values  while measurable  is lessened somewhat by our reserve weighting towards natural gas in poland 
credit markets 
we have a million senior facility agreement with the royal bank of scotland  or rbs  in london  england 
in october of last year  partly in response to the turmoil in the banking industry and to guarantee that we would have the cash on hand necessary to fund our commitments  we drew down the entire balance of the facility 
since that time  through various bail out initiatives  rbs has become majority owned by the government of the united kingdom 
at present  we do not know what impact the distress in the banking industry in general  and on rbs in particular  will have on us 
we are in compliance with all of the terms of the facility and are in active discussions with rbs to extend and expand the terms and size of the facility 
despite the fact that we believe we have reserve volumes and values that would command a sizable increase in the facility in normal times  there is no guarantee that rbs will  in fact  increase the amount of funds available to us 
this may  in turn  restrict the amount of capital we are able to apply in our development programs in poland 
equity markets 
virtually every gas and oil company worldwide has seen its market capitalization value decline precipitously over the past six months 
we are no exception 
our stock price has declined more than from its peak and  as of late january  over the preceding months 
we have traditionally funded our exploration programs  both in poland and in the united states  through the issuance of equity 
while we believe that the equity markets remain accessible  we may be unwilling to issue new equity at current depressed stock prices to fund our capital expansion 
again  this may restrict the amount of capital we are able to apply in our development programs in poland 
capital and operating budgets 
because of the circumstances discussed above  we are acutely aware of the need to preserve and be judicious in the use of our existing capital 
we are making adjustments to our capital and operating budgets as follows 
other than for capital projects that were committed and in process at year end  we have determined  in consultation with our partner  pogc  to not initiate new capital projects in until the commencement of production at our roszkow well in poland 
we currently expect production to commence sometime during the latter part of the second quarter 
this means that any new seismic and drilling projects will not begin until the second half of despite these changes in timing  however  we expect cash flow from the roszkow well to help us to resume drilling in our core area in the second half of we have also taken steps to reduce our operating budget 
for the year  we reduced our cash overhead costs by approximately from budgeted levels  primarily by reducing compensation costs 
we currently expect to reduce cash overhead costs by an additional  again by reducing compensation and other controllable costs 
property impairments 
the drop in oil prices and the adjusted timing of our capital budget caused us to record property impairment charges during the fourth quarter of in the united states  we have impaired the cost of most of our producing oil wells due to lower reserve volumes and values 
in poland  we have impaired the cost of two of our recent drilling projects due to the adjusted timing of our capital plans 
these impairments are noncash charges  and do not mean that we have abandoned or stopped production at any of the properties involved 
in the united states  we recorded an impairment charge at year end of approximately million related to our oil properties 
this is the amount by which the year end net book value of our producing properties exceeded the estimated discounted future cash flows  as determined using year end oil prices from those properties 
in each case  the wells continue to produce  and we continue to carefully monitor both oil prices and operating costs to ensure that we are producing the wells efficiently and economically 
in poland  we have impaired the costs of two wells  the grundy well and the sroda well 
according to the provisions of fasb statement no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas companies  capitalized costs of exploratory wells are required to be expensed if reserves cannot be classified as proved after one year following the completion of drilling 
accordingly  we have recorded an impairment charge of million associated with the grundy well and million associated with the sroda well in foreign currency volatility 
we enter into various agreements in poland denominated in the polish zloty 
the polish zloty is subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond our control 
during the past months  the zloty has fluctuated between a low of zlotys per us dollar in august of to a high of zlotys per dollar in late february of we have historically used the us dollar as our functional currency for us financial reporting purposes 
we record receivables and payables at fixed amounts in us dollars on their respective transaction dates  when the receivables and payables are subsequently settled at different exchange rates  we recognize foreign currency gains or losses in our statements of operations 
in addition  variations in exchange rates also affect the us dollar denominated amount of revenue we receive in polish zlotys 
as the us dollar strengthens  our us dollar denominated revenue received in polish zlotys declines  conversely  when the us dollar weakens  our us dollar denominated revenue received in polish zlotys increase 
should exchange rates in effect during early continue throughout the year  we expect the exchange rates to have a negative impact on our us dollar denominated revenues 
at the same time  however  our us denominated costs of conducting business in poland  which includes drilling  geological and geophysical  and overhead costs  will also decline at the same rate 
we are also generating revenues in poland in polish zlotys  and we keep those zlotys in poland and use them to pay zloty based invoices 
our policy is to reduce currency risk by  under ordinary circumstances  transferring dollars to zlotys  or fixing the exchange rate for future transfers of dollars to zlotys  on or about the occasion of making any significant commitment payable in polish currency  taking into consideration the future timing and amounts of committed costs and the estimated timing and amounts of zloty based revenues 
during october  we drew down the remaining million of availability under our senior credit facility to ensure that we had the necessary capital on hand to meet existing commitments 
at the same time  we purchased approximately million in polish zloty forward contracts 
these contracts matured at the end of each month  beginning in october and concluding in march  the rate for each of the contracts was zlotys per us dollar  which  at the time  was a week low for the zloty 
due to rapidly deteriorating exchange rates during the final two months of the year  these contracts  coupled with other transaction losses  caused us to record foreign exchange transaction losses during the year of million 
as of year end  we had three outstanding contracts denominated in us dollars as follows million that matured january   million that matured february   million that matures march  in connection with these outstanding contracts  we recorded an additional loss of approximately  when we marked them to market at december   when the exchange rate was zlotys per us dollar 
effective october   we changed the functional currency of our polish subsidiary from the us dollar to the polish zloty 
during the fourth quarter of  for the first time  we entered into forward zloty purchase contracts 
in early  we entered into construction and revenue agreements that would recognize the results of increasingly significant levels of production and corresponding revenues in polish zloty 
in recognition of these economic events combined with the resulting increases in future zloty revenues and expenditures of the polish entity  we determined that it was appropriate to change the functional currency of fx energy poland to the polish zloty 
sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  requires the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of a foreign operation to be measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation 
because fx energy poland s functional currency is now the polish zloty  translation adjustments will result from the process of translating its financial statements into the us dollar reporting currency 
translation adjustments will not be included in determining net income but shall be reported separately and accumulated in other comprehensive income 
the accounting basis of the assets and liabilities affected by the change are adjusted to reflect the difference between the exchange rate when the asset or liability arose and the exchange rate on the date of the change 
upon the change in functional currency  we recorded a cumulative translation adjustment cta of approximately million  which is shown in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity deficit 
because of the change in exchange rates between reporting periods and changes in certain account balances  the cta will change from period to period 
at december   the cta was approximately million reflecting the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the change in functional currency will also affect the amounts we report for our polish assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses from those that would be reported had we maintained the us dollar as the functional currency for our polish operations 
the differences will depend on changes in period average and period end exchange rates 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million  principally attributable to increases in the amount of polish zlotys necessary to satisfy outstanding intercompany dollar denominated loans and unpaid interest to fx energy  inc future transaction gains or losses may be significant given the amount of intercompany loans and the volatility of the exchange rate 
the change in functional currency will have no impact on our actual zloty based revenues and expenditures in poland 
oil and gas revenues and pricing revenues and production 
as we expected and forecasted in our form k  production at our wilga well in poland declined sharply in from its production levels 
production at our wilga well declined from mcfe to mcfe in  a decline of 
however  higher prices for both gas and oil  coupled with an increase in our drilling services revenues  mostly offset our production volume declines 
the following table highlights revenues and production volumes and shows the change from to change revenues in thousands oil gas sales total revenues production gas production mcf oil production bbls total production mcfe we expect to see an upward trend in production during as we anticipate bringing the roszkow well in poland into production 
results of operations by business segment we operate within two segments of the gas and oil industry the exploration and production  or e p  segment in poland and the united states  and the oilfield services segment in the united states 
direct revenues and costs  including depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  or dd a  general and administrative costs  or g a  and other income directly associated with their respective segments are detailed within the following discussion

exploration and production segment gas revenues 
revenues from gas sales were million during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
as we expected  production in at our wilga well declined sharply from levels 
consequently  company wide gas production for was lower than production 
conversely  two price increases  the first effective may and the second effective november   coupled with favorable exchange rates for the zloty against the us dollar for much of the year  resulted in higher effective gas prices  which increased from to gas revenues in increased from levels by approximately million due to higher gas prices  offset by approximately million related to production declines 
gas revenues in increased from levels by approximately million due to higher gas prices  coupled with approximately million related to higher production 
a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for gas revenues  average gas prices  gas production volumes  and lifting costs per mcf for the years ended december    and  is set forth in the following table for the year ended december  revenues percent change versus prior year na average price per mcf percent change versus prior year na production volumes mcf percent change versus prior year na lifting costs per mcf percent change versus prior year na lifting costs per mcf are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total volume of gas produced 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as with our gas production  oil production at wilga declined from to  which contributed significantly to the overall production decrease of 
production from our us properties also declined by  due to normal production declines and decreased workovers and maintenance 
these production declines  however  were more than offset by higher oil prices 
our average oil price during was per barrel  a increase over per barrel received during included in oil revenues were approximately  million  and  related to the sale of oil at the wilga well for the years ended december    and  respectively 
all other oil revenues during the three years were derived from our producing properties in the united states 
us oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately million due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately  related to production declines 
us oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately  due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately  related to production declines 
a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil revenues  average oil prices  oil production volumes  and lifting costs per barrel for the years ended december    and  is set forth in the following table in thousands  except for prices and percentages for the year ended december  revenues percent change versus prior year average price per bbl percent change versus prior year production volumes bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced 
light crude oil lifting costs in poland are based on an allocation of total costs based on relative revenues between gas and oil 
lifting costs include production taxes incurred in the united states 
lease operating costs 
lease operating costs were million in  million in  and million in operating costs decreased slightly in as we negotiated lower indirect costs at our non operated properties in poland 
the higher costs in compared to were reflective of the first full year s production in poland 
poland operating costs rose from  in to million in exploration costs 
our exploration efforts are focused in poland  and the expenses consist of geological and geophysical costs as well as the costs of exploratory dry holes 
exploration costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
geological and geophysical costs  or g g costs  were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during all three years  most of our g g costs were spent on acquiring  processing  and interpreting new d and d seismic data in the fences areas 
exploratory dry hole costs were million   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we drilled three shallow dry holes  two in montana and one in nevada 
during  all wells drilled during the year were determined to be commercial  and were completed for future production 
our exploration costs included approximately  associated with the drozdowice well in our fences iii concession area in poland  along with additional amounts for two dry holes in montana and nevada 
impairment costs 
impairments of gas and oil properties were million  million  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as discussed previously  during we impaired million and million related to our grundy and sroda wells in poland  respectively  and an additional million related to our producing properties in montana 
during we impaired million related to our wilga well  and in we impaired the entire amount of capitalized costs associated with our rusocin well 
dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was million  million  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from the million impairment in for our wilga well  as those costs were removed from our depletion base 
the increase from to was a reflection of a full year s worth of production in poland  discussed earlier 
dd a expense in poland was  in the remaining increase is due to capital cost additions in at our montana producing properties 
future dd a costs are expected to generally  but not completely  follow future production trends 
however  future dd a rates can be very different depending upon future capitalized costs 
oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we drilled wells for third parties during  along with additional well service work  compared to wells and wells during and  respectively 
oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
we cannot accurately predict future oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services costs 
oilfield services costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  or   and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
the year to year increases in costs were primarily due to increased drilling activity 
in general  oilfield servicing costs are directly associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield services costs will continue to fluctuate period to period based on the number of wells drilled  revenues generated  weather  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we spent   and  on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during   and respectively 
these capital additions resulted in higher dd a expenses for this segment during and bad debt expense oilfield services 
bad debt expense was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we wrote off as uncollectable  related to revenue recognized during for third party drilling services 
this was the first bad debt charged to expense in our history 
we do not expect to incur future bad debt charges 
nonsegmented items g a costs corporate 
g a costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
lower employee compensation costs in were offset by increases in accounting  insurance  and consulting costs 
in addition  legal fees associated with our ongoing litigation increased by approximately  over levels 
see item  legal proceedings  for additional information 
higher employee compensation costs in  associated in part with an expansion of our poland operations office  coupled with higher legal  insurance  and software maintenance costs  resulted in an increase in g a of million over levels 
stock compensation 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments  sfas no r  on january   using the modified prospective method 
stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in   and stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in   and and  of amortization of unvested stock options granted prior to  using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no r 
stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in and and million of amortization of unvested stock options granted prior to  using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
interest and other income expense corporate 
interest and other income expense was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we amortized  related to fees incurred in securing our senior credit facility to interest expense and paid  in commitment fees for the facility 
we also paid  in interest on outstanding borrowings 
these interest related costs were offset by interest income of  during  amortized fees and semiannual commitment fees for the facility totaled  in interest related charges 
these charges offset interest income of  an increase over levels due to higher cash balances available for investment 
foreign exchange 
as discussed previously  we incurred foreign exchange losses of million  and foreign exchange gains of  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
included in the losses was  related to mark to market adjustments to outstanding year end polish zloty forward contracts 
income taxes 
we incurred net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
liquidity and capital resources throughout our history  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  issuance of debt securities  and agreements with industry participants that funded our share of costs in certain exploratory activities in return for an interest in our properties 
with the establishment of proved reserves in poland  in november  we established a million senior credit facility with the royal bank of scotland to fund infrastructure and development costs in poland 
as of december   we had drawn down the full million available under this facility 
in addition  cash flow from our production operations has been providing a portion of our capital expenditures for the past months 
as of december   we have classified approximately million of auction rate securities as level financial assets 
see note to these financial statements for additional information concerning fair value accounting for our investments 
we believe we will be able to convert all remaining auction rate securities to cash within our normal operating cycle 
the recent strengthening of the us dollar will  if it continues  have a negative impact on our revenue and operating profit  conversely  our us dollar denominated capital costs in poland will decrease at the same rate 
we expect our exploration and development programs will continue in spite of the economic downturn  although at a slower pace than in previous years 
as we discussed previously  other than for capital projects that were committed and in process at year end  we have determined  in consultation with our partner  pogc  to not initiate new capital projects in until after the commencement of production at our roszkow well in poland 
this will enable us to conserve cash until the expected increases in revenue occurs 
our expected operating cash flow combined with our cash resources and marketable securities as of december   should more than enable us to meet our capital needs in the united states and poland for the next months  without accessing the capital or debt markets for additional funding 
we may seek to obtain additional funds for future capital investments from the sale of additional securities  project financing to help finance the completion of successful wells  sale of partial property interests  or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
as our reserves increase above the amounts estimated when we established our million senior credit facility with the royal bank of scotland  we may seek to expand our borrowings from it or other lenders 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  in view of the current global economic and credit crises and the particular impact on the royal bank of scotland  we cannot assure that our efforts to increase borrowings will be successful 
we will allocate our existing capital as well as funds we may obtain in the future among our various projects at our discretion 
we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon future events 
for example  we may change the allocation of our expenditures based on the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition  and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
working capital current assets less current liabilities 
our working capital was million as of december   a decrease of million from december  amounts borrowed under our senior credit facility  coupled with proceeds from the exercise of warrants  were used to fund a record level of drilling and seismic activities during operating activities 
we used net cash of million  million  and million in our operating activities during   and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net losses  excluding noncash charges  incurred in those years 
revenues from gas and oil sales in poland  which commenced in late  helped us reduce the amount of cash used in operations in all three years 
our current assets at year end included approximately million in accrued gas and oil sales from both the united states and poland  million in receivables related to our oilfield services segment  and million in refundable input vat that we expect to receive during the first six months of our current liabilities at year end included approximately million in costs related to our exploration activities in poland that were paid in early investing activities 
we used net cash in investing activities of million and million in and  respectively  and received net cash from investing activities of million in in we received million from the maturities of marketable securities 
we invested  in marketable securities 
we spent million for gas and oil property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and million adding to our oilfield services equipment 
in we received million from the maturities of marketable securities 
we invested million in marketable securities 
we spent million for gas and oil property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties

we received net cash from financing activities of million and million in and  respectively  and used net cash in financing activities of  in during  we borrowed million under our senior credit facility with rbs and million as a loan from ubs related to auction rate securities  of which  was repaid by december  in addition   options and warrants were exercised  resulting in proceeds to us of million 
during  we sold million shares of stock in a registered direct offering  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
in addition   options and warrants were exercised during the year  resulting in proceeds to us of an additional million 
all the cash used in financing activities in was used to pay the loan origination fees and associated legal costs related to our million senior credit facility

at december   the aggregate amounts of our contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years are as follows total in thousands senior credit facility interest payments on long term debt we had no other significant contractual obligations or commitments as of december  we are subject to certain work commitments with respect to our exploration concessions that must be satisfied in order to maintain our interest in those concessions 
these work commitments are optional on our part  however  they must be satisfied in order to maintain our interest in those concessions 
our gas and oil drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry that can cause severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations  personal injury  and loss of life 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our united states and poland operations and also rely on the insurance or financial capabilities of our exploration partners in poland 
these measures do not cover risks related to violations of environmental laws or all other risks involved in gas and oil exploration  drilling  and production 
we would be adversely affected by a significant event that is not fully covered by insurance or by our inability to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
asset retirement obligation 
we also have liabilities of million related to asset retirement obligations on our consolidated balance sheet at december   excluded from the table above 
due to the nature of these obligations  we cannot determine precisely when the payments will be made to settle these obligations

in october  fasb issued fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  to clarify guidance on determining the fair value of a financial asset under sfas no 
 fair value measurements  in a market that is not active 
fsp fas was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the adoption of this statement was effective october   and did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the sec issued a final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  which is effective january   for reporting reserve information 
the new disclosure requirements permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
the new disclosure requirements also require companies to include nontraditional resources such as oil sands  shale  coalbeds or other nonrenewable natural resources in reserves if they are intended to be upgraded to synthetic oil and gas 
currently the sec requires that reserve volumes are determined using prices on the last day of the reporting period  however  the new disclosure requirements provide for reporting oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices 
the new requirements also will allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors 
the new disclosure requirements also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of a reserves preparer or auditor 
we will adopt the provisions of the final rule in connection with our december  form k filing 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the final rule 
we have reviewed all recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our results of operations or financial position 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on our current or future financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies gas and oil activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our gas and oil properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that net capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not considered to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved gas and oil properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net cash flows determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
gains and losses are recognized on sales of entire interests in proved and unproved properties 
sales of partial interests are generally treated as a recovery of costs and any resulting gain or loss is recorded as other income 
revenues associated with gas and oil sales are recorded when title passes  which is upon delivery to the pipeline or purchaser  and are net of royalties 
oilfield service revenues are recognized when the related service is performed 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
gas and oil reserves engineering estimates of our gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
there are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated gas and oil reserves can be designated as proved 
proved reserve estimates are updated at least annually and take into account recent production and technical information about each field 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
this change is considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis in related depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rates 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  these estimates are used in determining dd a expense and impairment expense and in disclosing the supplemental standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved gas and oil properties 
dd a rates are determined based on estimated proved reserve quantities the denominator and capitalized costs of producing properties the numerator 
producing properties capitalized costs are amortized based on the units of gas or oil produced 
therefore  assuming all other variables are held constant  an increase in estimated proved reserves decreases our dd a expense 
also  estimated reserves are used to calculate future cash flows from our gas and oil operations  which serve as an indicator of fair value in determining whether a property is impaired or not 
the larger the estimated reserves  the less likely the property is impaired 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments 
under sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date that are subsequently modified or cancelled 
compensation expense for unvested awards at the effective date will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk price risk realized pricing for our oil production in the united states and poland is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price of oil  subject to gravity and other adjustments for the actual oil sold 
historically  oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility relating to our oil production is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
substantially all of our gas in poland is sold to pogc or its subsidiaries under contracts that extend for the life of each field 
prices are determined contractually and  in the case of our wilga  zaniemysl  and kleka wells  are tied to published tariffs 
the tariffs are set from time to time by the public utility regulator in poland 
although we are not directly subject to such tariffs  we have elected to link our price to these tariffs in our contracts with pogc 
we expect that the prices we receive in the short term for gas we produce will be lower than would be the case in an unregulated setting and may be lower than prevailing western european prices 
we believe it is more likely than not that  over time  the end user gas price in poland will converge with the average price in europe 
we currently do not engage in any hedging activities to protect ourselves against market risks associated with gas and oil price fluctuations  although we may elect to do in the future 
foreign currency risk we enter into various agreements in poland denominated in the polish zloty 
the polish zloty is subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond our control 
our policy is to reduce currency risk by  under ordinary circumstances  transferring dollars to zlotys  or fixing the exchange rate for future transfers of dollars to zlotys  on or about the occasion of making any significant commitment payable in polish currency  taking into consideration the future timing and amounts of committed costs and the estimated timing and amounts of zloty based revenues 
during the past months  the zloty has fluctuated between a low of zlotys per us dollar in august of to a high of zlotys per dollar in late february of we have historically used the us dollar as our functional currency for us financial reporting purposes 
we record receivables and payables at fixed amounts in us dollars on their respective transaction dates  when the receivables and payables are subsequently settled at different exchange rates  we recognize foreign currency gains or losses in our statements of operations 
in addition  variations in exchange rates also affect the us dollar denominated amount of revenue we receive in polish zlotys 
as the us dollar strengthens  our us dollar denominated revenue received in polish zlotys declines  conversely  when the us dollar weakens  our us dollar denominated revenue received in polish zlotys increases 
should exchange rates in effect during early continue throughout the year  we expect the exchange rates to have a negative impact on our us dollar denominated revenues 
at the same time  however  our us denominated costs of conducting business in poland  which includes drilling  geological and geophysical  and overhead costs  will also decline at the same rate 
we are also generating revenues in poland in polish zlotys  and we keep those zlotys in poland and use them to pay zloty based invoices 
in terms of actual zloty purchasing power  our gas prices are in fact higher today than they were earlier this year  due to the two price increases discussed earlier 
during october  we drew down the remaining million available under our senior credit facility to ensure that we had the necessary capital on hand to meet existing commitments 
at the same time  we purchased approximately million in polish zloty forward contracts 
these contracts matured at the end of each month  beginning in october and concluding in march the rate of the contract was zlotys per us dollar  which  at the time  was a week low for the zloty 
as of year end  we had three outstanding contracts denominated in us dollars as follows million that matured january   million that matured february   million that matures march  in connection with these outstanding contracts  we recorded an additional loss of  when we marked them to market at december   when the exchange rate was zlotys per us dollar
