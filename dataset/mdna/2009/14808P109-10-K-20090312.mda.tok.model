item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information about the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the years ended december   and all share and per share data have been restated to give effect to the and stock dividends issued on september  and december   respectively 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
executive overview cass provides payment and information processing services to large manufacturing  distribution and retail enterprises from its processing centers in st 
louis  missouri  columbus  ohio  boston  massachusetts  greenville  south carolina and wellington  kansas 
the company s services include freight invoice rating  payment processing  auditing  and the generation of accounting and transportation information 
cass also processes and pays utility invoices  which include electricity  gas and telecommunications expenses  and is a provider of telecom expense management solutions 
cass extracts  stores and presents information from freight  utility and telecommunication invoices  assisting its customers transportation  energy and information technology managers in making decisions that will enable them to improve operating performance 
the company receives data from multiple sources  electronic and otherwise  and processes the data to accomplish the specific operating requirements of its customers 
it then provides the data in a central repository for access and archiving 
the data is finally transformed into information through the company s databases that allow client interaction as required and provide internet based tools for analytical processing 
the company also  through cass commercial bank  its st 
louis  missouri based bank subsidiary  provides banking services in the st 
louis metropolitan area  orange county  california and other selected cities in the united states 
in addition to supporting the company s payment operations  the bank provides banking services to its target markets  which include privately owned businesses and churches and church related ministries 
the specific payment and information processing services provided to each customer are developed individually to meet each customer s requirements  which can vary greatly 
in addition  the degree of automation such as electronic data interchange  imaging  and web based solutions varies greatly among customers and industries 
these factors combine so that pricing varies greatly among the customer base 
in general  however  cass is compensated for its processing services through service fees and account balances that are generated during the payment process 
the amount  type and calculation of service fees vary greatly by service offering  but generally follow the volume of transactions processed 
interest income from the balances generated during the payment processing cycle is affected by the amount of time cass holds the funds prior to payment and the dollar volume processed 
both the number of transactions processed and the dollar volume processed are therefore key metrics followed by management 
other factors will also influence revenue and profitability  such as changes in the general level of interest rates  which have a significant effect on net interest income 
the funds generated by these processing activities are invested in overnight investments  investment grade securities and loans generated by the bank 
the bank earns most of its revenue from net interest income  or the difference between the interest earned on its loans and investments and the interest paid on its deposits 
the bank also assesses fees on other services such as cash management services 
industry wide factors that impact the company include the willingness of large corporations to outsource key business functions such as freight  utility and telecommunication payment and audit 
the benefits that can be achieved by outsourcing transaction processing and the management information generated by cass systems can be influenced by factors such as the competitive pressures within industries to improve profitability  the general level of transportation costs  deregulation of energy costs and consolidation of telecommunication providers 
economic factors that impact the company include the general level of economic activity that can affect the volume and size of invoices processed  the ability to hire and retain qualified staff and the growth and quality of the loan portfolio 
as lower levels of economic activity are encountered  such as those experienced in the second half of  the number and total dollar amount of transactions processed by the company may decline thereby reducing fee revenue  interest income  and possibly liquidity 
the general level of interest rates also has a significant effect on the revenue of the company 
as discussed in greater detail in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  a decline in the general level of interest rates  as has been experienced during  can have a negative impact on net interest income 
on july   the company acquired of the stock of ntransit  inc ntransit  a company that provides auditing and expense management of parcel shipments 
while this acquisition did not meet the regulation s x criteria of a significant business combination  it positioned the company to expand its offerings in the specialized service and expertise in parcel shipping  which is a unique segment of the transportation industry that has experienced significant growth in recent years 
total fee revenue and other income in increased  or  and net interest income after provision for loan losses also referred to as net investment income decreased  or  while total operating expenses increased  or 
these results were driven by a  or  increase in items processed and  or  increase in dollars processed  which were somewhat offset by the impact of a higher provision for loan losses and the decline in the general level of interest rates 
the asset quality of the company s loans and investments appears strong 
currently  management views cass major opportunity and challenge as the continued expansion of its payment and information processing service offerings and customer base 
management intends to accomplish this by maintaining the company s lead in applied technology  which we believe  when combined with the security and processing controls of the bank  makes cass unique in the industry 
recent developments the us and global economies have experienced and are experiencing significant stress and disruptions in the financial sector 
in response to the financial crisis  in october  the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
in addition  the us treasury department announced that it has been authorized to purchase equity stakes in participating us financial institutions 
under this program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp capital purchase program  the us treasury department will make capital available to participating us financial institutions in exchange for  generally  preferred stock 
further  after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the frb  the us treasury signed the systemic risk exception to the fdic act  enabling the fdic to temporarily provide a guarantee of the senior debt of all fdic insured institutions and their holding companies  as well as non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts under a temporary liquidity guarantee program 
after careful assessment  and due to its strong capital base  the company chose not to participate in the tarp capital purchase program 
the company elected to participate in the temporary liquidity guarantee program  as not participating could have put the company at a competitive disadvantage without the fdic guarantee of its non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts 
the fdic guarantee of senior debt was not a factor in the company s decision process  as it has no senior debt outstanding 
critical accounting policies the company has prepared the consolidated financial information in this report in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates have been generally accurate in the past  have been consistent and have not required any material changes 
there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and are described below 
impairment of assets 
the company periodically evaluates certain long term assets such as intangible assets including goodwill  foreclosed assets  internally developed software and investments in private equity securities for impairment 
generally  these assets are initially recorded at cost  and recognition of impairment is required when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets will not be recoverable in the future 
if impairment occurs  various methods of measuring impairment may be called for depending on the circumstances and type of asset  including quoted market prices  estimates based on similar assets  and estimates based on valuation techniques such as discounted projected cash flows 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
these policies affect both segments of the company and require significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different results if conditions or underlying circumstances change 
pension plans 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pensions are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels and mortality rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 
on december  sfas no 
requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation as of the date of its fiscal year end 
income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns such as the realization of deferred tax assets  changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  the company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
effective january   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin provides guidance for the recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
the company performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to assess overall collectability 
the level of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s estimate of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
although these estimates are based on established methodologies for determining allowance requirements  actual results can differ significantly from estimated results 
these policies affect both segments of the company 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations are discussed in the provision and allowance for loan losses section of this report

loans have been classified as having floating interest rates if the rate specified in the loan varies with the prime commercial rate of interest 
note due to the historically low interest rates encountered during the company instituted a floor for its prime lending rate 
the company has no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans  which are not otherwise disclosed in the loan portfolio composition table and as are discussed in item  note of this report 
as can be seen in the loan composition table above and as are discussed in item  note  the company s primary market niche for banking services is privately held businesses and churches and church related ministries 
loans to commercial entities are generally secured by the business assets of the borrower  including accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  and the real estate from which the borrower operates 
operating lines of credit to these companies generally are secured by accounts receivable and inventory  with specific percentages of each determined on a customer by customer basis based on various factors including the type of business 
intermediate term credit for machinery and equipment is generally provided at some percentage of the value of the equipment purchased  depending on the type of machinery or equipment purchased by the entity 
loans secured exclusively by real estate to businesses and churches are generally made with a maximum loan to value ratio  depending upon the company s estimate of the resale value and ability of the property to generate cash 
the company s loan policy requires an independent appraisal for all loans over  secured by real estate 
company management monitors the local economy in an attempt to determine whether it has had a significant deteriorating effect on such real estate credits 
when problems are identified  appraised values are updated on a continual basis  either internally or through an updated external appraisal 
loan portfolio changes from december  to december  total loans increased  or  to  this increase was the result of two primary factors the successful implementation of new marketing efforts by the company s lending staff and the negative impact of the credit crisis on many of the company s competitors resulted in more attractive loan growth opportunities 
the growth in real estate construction loans was primarily due to increased activity in the church portfolio 
at year end  church and church related real estate and construction loans totaled  which represents a increase over additional details regarding the types and maturities of loans in the loan portfolio are contained in the tables above and in item  note loan portfolio changes from december  to december  total loans decreased  or  to  this decrease was due mainly to the reduction in commercial and industrial loans as loans were paid down 
at the end of  church and church related real estate and construction credits totaled  which represents a increase over additional details regarding the types and maturities of loans in the loan portfolio are contained in the tables above and in item  note provision and allowance for loan losses the company recorded a provision for loan losses of  in   in and  in the amount of the provisions for loan losses was derived from the company s quarterly analysis of the allowance for loan losses in relation to probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision will fluctuate as determined by these quarterly analyses 
the company had net loan charge offs of   and  in  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses was  at december  compared to  at december  and  at december  the year end allowance represented of outstanding loans  compared to at year end and at year end from december  to december   the level of nonperforming loans decreased  from  to  which represents 
of outstanding loans 
nonperforming loans are more fully explained in the section entitled nonperforming assets 
the allowance for loan losses has been established and is maintained to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
an ongoing assessment of risk of loss is performed to determine if the current balance of the allowance is adequate to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
charges or credits are made to expense to cover any deficiency or reduce any excess  as required 
the current methodology employed to determine the appropriate allowance consists of two components  specific and general 
the company develops specific valuation allowances on commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans based on individual review of these loans and an estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and collection options available 
the general component relates to all other loans  which are evaluated based on loan grade 
the loan grade assigned to each loan is typically evaluated on an annual basis  unless circumstances require interim evaluation 
the company assigns a reserve amount consistent with each loan s rating category 
the reserve amount is based on derived loss experience over prescribed periods 
in addition to the amounts derived from the loan grades  a portion is added to the general reserve to take into account other factors including national and local economic conditions  downturns in specific industries including loss in collateral value  trends in credit quality at the company and the banking industry  and trends in risk rating changes 
as part of their examination process  federal and state agencies review the company s methodology for maintaining the allowance for loan losses and the balance in the account 
these agencies may require the company to increase the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and interpretations about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following schedule summarizes activity in the allowance for loan losses and the allocation of the allowance to the company s loan categories 
during  the allocation of the allowance to the commercial loan portfolio declined because one loan with a reserve allocation of  was paid off and one loan of  was charged off 
the allocation to the real estate portfolio increased primarily due to the  in additional loan balances

although specific allocations exist  the entire allowance is available to absorb losses in any particular loan category 
nonperforming assets it is the policy of the company to continually monitor its loan portfolio and to discontinue the accrual of interest on any loan on which payment of principal or interest in a timely manner in the normal course of business  is doubtful 
subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to principal if there is any doubt as to the collectability of such principal  otherwise  these receipts are recorded as interest income

the decrease in accruing loans days or more past due is primarily related to one loan of  that was past its maturity date  however  full payment was received in march  the company does not have any foreign loans 
the company s loan portfolio does not include a significant amount of single family real estate mortgages  as the company does not market its services to retail customers

liquidity the discipline of liquidity management as practiced by the company seeks to ensure that funds are available to fulfill all payment obligations relating to invoices processed as they become due  meet depositor withdrawal requests and borrower credit demands while at the same time maximizing profitability 
this is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in supply of funds 
primary liquidity to meet demand is provided by short term liquid assets that can be converted to cash  maturing securities and the ability to obtain funds from external sources 
the company s asset liability committee alco has direct oversight responsibility for the company s liquidity position and profile 
management considers both on balance sheet and off balance sheet items in its evaluation of liquidity 
the balances of liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents  which include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  and money market funds  and were  at december   a decrease of  or from december  at december  these assets represented of total assets 
the company decreased liquid assets during as a result of the significant drop in short term interest rates 
the excess liquidity held at the end of was invested in higher yielding loans and investment securities to help maximize net interest income during cash and cash equivalents are the company s and its subsidiaries primary source of liquidity to meet future expected and unexpected loan demand  depositor withdrawals or reductions in accounts and drafts payable 
secondary sources of liquidity include the investment portfolio and borrowing lines

the bank has unsecured lines of credit at correspondent banks to purchase federal funds up to a maximum of  additionally  the bank maintains lines of credit at unaffiliated financial institutions in the maximum amount of  collateralized by us treasury securities and commercial mortgage loans 
the deposits of the company s banking subsidiary have historically been stable  consisting of a sizable volume of core deposits related to customers that utilize many other commercial products of the bank 
the accounts and drafts payable generated by the company have also historically been a stable source of funds 
net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the years  and were   and  respectively 
net income plus depreciation and amortization accounts for most of the operating cash provided 
net cash flows from investing and financing activities fluctuate greatly as the company actively manages its investment and loan portfolios and customer activity influences changes in deposit and accounts and drafts payable balances 
further analysis of the changes in these account balances is discussed earlier in this report 
due to the daily fluctuations in these account balances  management believes that the analysis of changes in average balances  also discussed earlier in this report  can be more indicative of underlying activity than the period end balances used in the statements of cash flows 
management anticipates that cash and cash equivalents  maturing investments  cash from operations  and borrowing lines will continue to be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital expenditures in capital resources one of management s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital base to warrant the confidence of customers  shareholders  and bank regulatory agencies 
a strong capital base is needed to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities that arise and to provide assurance to depositors and creditors 
the company and its banking subsidiary continue to exceed all regulatory capital requirements  as evidenced by the capital ratios at december  as shown in item  note of this report

the company maintains a treasury stock buyback program pursuant to which the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
this repurchase plan was updated by the board of directors on january  and replaced the company s previous plan under which  shares had remained available for repurchase 
the company repurchased  shares during and did not repurchase any shares during as of december    shares remained available for repurchase under the program 
a portion of the repurchased shares may be used for the company s employee benefit plans  and the balance will be available for other general corporate purposes 
the stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations  cash requirements for investments  repayment of debt  current stock price  and other factors 
the company may repurchase shares from time to time on the open market or in private transactions  including structured transactions 
the stock repurchase program may be modified or discontinued at any time 
as discussed in the recent developments section above  after careful assessment and due to its strong capital base  the company chose not to participate in the tarp capital purchase program 
commitments  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company is party to activities that involve credit  market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the company s consolidated financial statements 
such activities include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments and commitments under operating and capital leases 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
the company s maximum potential exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments 
at december   no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses for these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company or its subsidiaries to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
these off balance sheet financial instruments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
at december   the balance of loan commitments  standby and commercial letters of credit were   and  respectively 
since some of the financial instruments may expire without being drawn upon  the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are subject to the same underwriting standards as those financial instruments included on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary upon extension of the credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company faces market risk to the extent that its net interest income and its fair market value of equity are affected by changes in market interest rates 
the asset liability management discipline as applied by the company seeks to limit the volatility  to the extent possible  of both net interest income and the fair market value of equity that can result from changes in market interest rates 
this is accomplished by limiting the maturities of fixed rate investments  loans  and deposits  matching fixed rate assets and liabilities to the extent possible  and optimizing the mix of fees and net interest income 
however  as discussed below  the company s asset liability position differs significantly from most other bank holding companies with significant positive cumulative gaps shown for each time horizon presented 
this asset sensitive position is caused primarily by the operations of the company  which generate large balances of accounts and drafts payable 
these balances  which are noninterest bearing  contribute to the company s historical high net interest margin but cause the company to become susceptible to changes in interest rates  with a decreasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of declining interest rates and an increasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of rising interest rates 
the company s alco measures the company s interest rate risk sensitivity on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage the variability of earnings and fair market value of equity in various interest rate environments 
the alco evaluates the company s risk position to determine whether the level of exposure is significant enough to hedge a potential decline in earnings and value or whether the company can safely increase risk to enhance returns 
the alco uses gap reports  twelve month net interest income simulations  and fair market value of equity analyses as its main analytical tools to provide management with insight into the company s exposure to changing interest rates 
management uses a gap report to review any significant mismatch between the re pricing points of the company s rate sensitive assets and liabilities in certain time horizons 
a negative gap indicates that more liabilities re price in that particular time frame and  if rates rise  these liabilities will re price faster than the assets 
a positive gap would indicate the opposite 
gap reports can be misleading in that they capture only the re pricing timing within the balance sheet  and fail to capture other significant risks such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
basis risk involves the potential for the spread relationship between rates to change under different rate environments and embedded options risk relates to the potential for the alteration of the level and or timing of cash flows given changes in rates 
another measurement tool used by management is net interest income simulation  which forecasts net interest income during the coming twelve months under different interest rate scenarios in order to quantify potential changes in short term accounting income 
management has set policy limits specifying acceptable levels of interest rate risk given multiple simulated rate movements 
these simulations are more informative than gap reports because they are able to capture more of the dynamics within the balance sheet  such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
a table containing simulation results as of december   from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates is shown below 
while net interest income simulations do an adequate job of capturing interest rate risk to short term earnings  they do not capture risk within the current balance sheet beyond twelve months 
the company uses fair market value of equity analyses to help identify longer term risk that may reside on the current balance sheet 
the fair market value of equity is represented by the present value of all future income streams generated by the current balance sheet 
the company measures the fair market value of equity as the net present value of all asset and liability cash flows discounted at forward rates suggested by the current us treasury curve plus appropriate credit spreads 
this representation of the change in the fair market value of equity under different rate scenarios gives insight into the magnitude of risk to future earnings due to rate changes 
management has set policy limits relating to declines in the market value of equity
