item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide proprietary  value added products to a diverse customer base covering a broad spectrum of industries 
this strategic customer diversification means that demand for our products depends  in part  upon certain general economic conditions  which affect our markets in varying ways from year to year 
similar to and  in the first half of the company continued to benefit from a strong manufacturing economy 
at the end of the third quarter of business conditions worldwide grew weaker and appreciably worsened during the fourth quarter of as customers reacted to adverse market conditions  which affected each of the company s businesses 
while business conditions weakened at the end of  the company achieved a full year sales record of million as a result of the strong start in the first half of the year  the continuing growth in the wind energy and military markets  and the full year results of avon bearings corporation avon acquired in october benefiting from the record sales  the company generated net income of million  and cash flow from operating activities of million during despite the strong cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million during the year as the company invested million in net capital expenditures  million for stock repurchases  million to partially fund its qualified pension plans  and increased its common stock dividend 
the total order book for equaled million  compared to million in  and million in our year end backlog of million provides a firm foundation for operating performance in however  with recessionary pressures building in the united states and europe and slowing growth in china and india  the near term will be challenging 
also  the worst investment conditions in more than half a century resulted in a substantial decline in our pension fund assets which will contribute to an increase in pension expense of more than million compared to our investable balances provided significant interest income in and early  but no longer are providing income due to interest rates that are now near zero percent 
during the company continued its wind energy capacity expansion program and also successfully integrated avon into the friction control products segment 
avon is a custom designer and manufacturer of high precision large diameter turntable bearings 
avon also remanufactures bearings and sells replacement bearings 
the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of avon in october in a cash transaction valued at million  net of million of working capital adjustments recorded in in the third quarter of  the company completed the conversion of its million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes were converted into a total of  shares of the company s common stock  which were issued from treasury stock 
as a result the company is now debt free 
the company continues to focus on programs intended to reduce costs  improve capacity utilization  increase efficiencies  and grow market share and cash flow  thereby positioning the company to capitalize on future opportunities in targeted markets 
the company expects to complete its capacity expansion program to provide performance critical specialty bearings to serve the rapidly growing wind energy market in the first half of the company also continued its lean sigma effort and its investments in lean manufacturing and information systems to strengthen the company s operational excellence 
maintaining the company s strong balance sheet and financial flexibility remains a key strategy of the company 
the company s current cash and cash equivalent balances and its million revolving credit facility provide liquidity and additional financial strength to support the company s objectives  including strategic acquisitions 
in summary  in the future the company expects to benefit from the growth of key markets  principally the wind energy market 
the company is also well positioned to take full advantage of both internal growth initiatives and strategic acquisition opportunities that become available 
however  the current adverse worldwide economic conditions are challenging 
because many of these factors are external to the company  it is difficult to predict the specific impact they may have on the company s future operating results 
due to current economic conditions  coupled with the lagged effect of recent economic stimulus  the company expects shipments to be more weighted towards the latter half of than in past years 
the discussion which follows should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report to assist in understanding the company s results of operations  its financial condition  cash flows  capital structure and other relevant financial information

liquidity  working capital  and cash flows one of our financial strategies is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity supported by strong cash flow 
historically  we have generated significant cash flows from operating activities to fund capital expenditures  dividends and other operating requirements 
cash flow generation has been enhanced by our continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies  cost reductions and the management of working capital requirements 
we continued to follow this strategy in  despite worsening economic conditions 
net cash from operating activities equaled million in  million in  and million in net cash from operating activities in declined compared to due to decreased net income and increased investment in working capital associated with sales growth  which more than offset the benefits of decreased contributions to our qualified pension plans

litigation we are a party to various pending lawsuits and other matters arising in the normal course of business 
the company s estimated legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with claims  lawsuits and environmental matters are accrued in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from the current estimates made by the company 
we have identified certain accounting policies and estimates  described below  that are the most critical to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions regarding future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known or anticipated engineering change orders  new products  and other factors 
we believe the accounting estimates related to inventories to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine the valuation of inventories  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived assets including fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets may warrant revision or that remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the long lived assets that is compared to the carrying value of the asset to evaluate whether the asset costs are recoverable 
we believe the accounting estimates related to long lived asset impairment to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  and projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note and note in this annual report for additional information regarding long lived assets 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company annually at july  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a need  tests the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we identify impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
the fair value of each of our reporting units is derived from an estimate of discounted future cash flows including estimates for terminal value 
in we used an percent discount rate  and a growth assumption of percent in perpetuity to calculate terminal value 
in an percent discount rate was utilized 
the discount rate used each year is the value weighted average of the company s estimated cost of equity and estimated cost of debt cost of capital derived using both known and estimated  customary  marketplace metrics 
the principal marketplace metric used in the estimation of the discount rate that changed from to was an industry capital structure that was more heavily weighted toward the debt component  which has a lower cost and a reduction in treasury bond yields used in estimating the risk free rate of return 
our calculation methodology was unchanged during  and the consistent application of this methodology may result in kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents changes in the discount rate in future periods 
potential goodwill impairment is identified if a reporting unit s carrying amount is more than a reporting unit s fair value 
if this occurs  normally a third party valuation specialist is utilized to assist the company in determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the amount of any actual impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
certain trademarks are the company s only indefinite lived intangible assets 
we identify impairment of these trademarks by comparing their fair value to their carrying amounts 
the fair values of the trademarks are calculated based on estimates of discounted future cash flows related to the net amount of royalty expenses avoided due to the existence of the trademarks 
we believe the accounting estimates related to impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of discounted future cash flows and terminal values  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary  and the calculation of implied fair value is inherently subject to estimates 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
retirement benefits our employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations recorded in the financial statements are dependent on the company s estimates provided to and used by our actuaries in calculating such amounts 
we believe the accounting estimates related to retirement benefits to be critical accounting estimates because of the wide range of assumptions used in deriving yearly contribution and expense amounts as well as the amounts recorded for retirement benefits in our financial statements 
significant assumptions include judgments regarding discount rates  health care cost trend rates  salary growth rates  and long term returns on plan assets 
we have developed estimates based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
in developing the discount rate assumption used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations  the company uses the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits 
the equivalent weighted average discount rate is calculated by imputing the interest rate that equates the total present value with the stream of future cash flows 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical data  the near term outlook  and on an assessment of likely long term trends 
salary growth assumptions reflect our long term experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
long term return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of historical and expected returns of the individual asset classes comprising the total plan assets 
for individual categories of equity securities  historical total and real rates of return are considered  together with inflation and overall market factors including dividend yield  earnings growth  changes in price earnings ratios and volatility of returns 
for various fixed income asset categories  expected long term returns are determined after consideration of current yields on fixed income securities  inflation  historical yields relative to benchmarks  and long term default rates 
for other asset classes  including real estate  expected long term returns are determined through consideration of certain factors  which may include historical returns  dividend yields  inflation  benchmark returns and net asset values 
assumed discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets  and rate of compensation increase have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plans 
a percent increase in the discount rate would have decreased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million 
a percent decrease in the discount rate would have increased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and would have increased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million 
a percent increase in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have decreased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and a percent decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have increased the net periodic benefit cost by million during a percent increase in the rate of compensation increase would have increased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and would have increased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million 
a percent decrease in the rate of compensation increase would have decreased the net periodic benefit cost by million  and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million 
the rate of compensation increase used to determine benefit obligations at year end was developed using an age graded salary scale with a weighted average of percent 
an average rate of compensation increase of percent was used to determine benefit obligations at the measurement date in and for pension and postretirement benefit costs in and kaydon corporation form k

while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding costs  obligations  and assumptions for employee pension and postretirement benefits 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed for recoverability by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
income tax is provided based upon an effective tax rate that is dependent upon tax regulations governing the regions in which we conduct business  geographic composition of worldwide earnings  the availability of tax credits and other factors 
the company has liabilities recorded for unrecognized tax benefits totaling million as of december   all of which would affect the effective tax rate 
it is the company s policy to include interest and penalties incurred due to underpayment or late payment of income taxes due to a taxing authority on a net of tax basis as a component of income tax expense 
the company has recorded million in liabilities for tax related interest and penalties on its consolidated balance sheet  as of december  the company does not expect that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months 
the company  or one or more of its subsidiaries  operates and files income tax returns in the united states  various states  and foreign jurisdictions 
foreign jurisdictions significant to the company include germany and the united kingdom 
with limited exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal tax examinations for years before  state examinations for years before  german tax examinations for years before  or united kingdom tax examinations for years before we believe the accounting estimates related to income taxes to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine deferred tax assets and liabilities and to record current tax benefits and liabilities  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change from year to year causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding income taxes 
forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of regarding the company s plans  expectations  estimates and beliefs 
forward looking statements are typically identified by words such as believes  anticipates  estimates  expects  intends  will  may  should  could  potential  projects  approximately and other similar expressions  including statements regarding pending litigation  general economic conditions  competitive dynamics and the adequacy of capital resources 
these forward looking statements may include  among other things  projections of the company s financial performance  anticipated growth and expansion  characterization of and the company s ability to control contingent liabilities  and anticipated trends in the company s businesses 
these statements are only predictions  based on the company s current expectation about future events 
although the company believes the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  it cannot guarantee future results  performance or achievements or that predictions or current expectations will be accurate 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents in addition  the company or persons acting on its behalf may from time to time publish or communicate other items that could also be construed to be forward looking statements 
statements of this sort are or will be based on the company s estimates  assumptions  and projections and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements 
kaydon does not undertake any responsibility to update its forward looking statements or risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances except to the extent required by applicable law 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which exist as part of our ongoing business operations including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt and investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
short term investments at december  included auction rate securities and other investments that were classified as available for sale and were expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed within twelve months 
we place our investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a basis point decrease in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average investment interest rate for would not have a material impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  mexico  and asia 
therefore  changes in the value of currencies of these countries in these regions affect our financial condition and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of our currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which certain costs are local currency based 
in addition  periodically  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a percent change in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition and cash flows
