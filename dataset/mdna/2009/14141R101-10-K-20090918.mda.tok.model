item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview historically  our business focused on the design  manufacture and marketing of proprietary automated anastomotic systems used by cardiac surgeons to perform coronary bypass surgery 
recently  we have expanded our business to include the development of an endoscopic microcutter intended for use by general  thoracic  gynecologic  bariatric and urologic surgeons 
unless and until this product is developed and cleared for marketing in the united states or elsewhere  or we enter into an arrangement with a development and commercialization partner that provides us with development revenue  we will have ongoing costs related thereto without related revenue 
we are also developing a pfo device in collaboration with cook incorporated  or cook  as described below 
our agreement with cook related to the development of this device  described below  provides us with opportunities for potential milestone and royalty revenue 
we currently sell our c port distal anastomosis systems  or c port systems  in the united states and europe 
we also currently sell our pas port proximal anastomosis system  or pas port system  in the united states and in europe and japan through distributors 
the pas port system is used to perform a proximal anastomosis  which is the connection of a bypass graft vessel to the aorta or other source of blood 
we received k clearance to market our pas port system in the united states in september as of june   more than  pas port systems had been sold in the united states  europe and japan 
in addition to our commercialized cardiac surgery products  we have commenced development of the cardica microcutter  a multi fire endolinear microcutter device based on our proprietary staple on a strip technology  which would expand our commercial opportunity into additional surgical markets 
we are in discussions with multiple potential development and commercialization partners to advance further development of the cardica microcutter and other potential products in this product line  and we may enter into an arrangement to pursue further development of this product with a partner 
we are in the process of adding independent distributors and manufacturers representatives to support a core direct sales team for our c port systems and pas port system in the united states to contain sales costs while continuing to serve our customers and potential customers for our automated anastomosis product line 
we are shifting our development efforts to focus on our endoscopic microcutter 
we manufacture our cardiac products  our c port systems and pas port systems with parts we manufacture and components supplied by vendors  which we then assemble  test and package 
for fiscal year  we generated net revenue of million  including million of development revenue  and incurred a net loss of million 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
to date  our c port and pas port systems have had limited commercial adoption  and sales have not met the levels that we had anticipated 
revenues from product sales and milestone payments were not sufficient to support the operation of our business as we had planned 
as a result  in order to reduce our operating expenses  in january  april and may  we reduced our costs by eliminating  and positions  respectively  which impacted all functional areas  including research and development  sales and marketing  clinical  regulatory and quality  operations and general and administrative 
we expect these reductions in force to impair our ability to continue sales at current or increased levels 
we are continuing to evaluate potential additional steps to reduce our operating expenses 
we are also seeking to raise additional funds 
if adequate funds are not available or revenues from product sales do not increase  we may be required to delay  further reduce the scope of or eliminate our commercialization efforts with respect to one or more of our products or one or more of our research and development programs 

table of contents as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and total short term debt of million 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  along with the cash that we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs to enable us to conduct our business substantially as currently conducted through december  accordingly  our financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   included in this annual report on form k contain a going concern qualification from our independent registered public accounting firm 
our estimates and our future capital requirements depend upon numerous factors 
in addition  we have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  including assumptions with respect to the level of revenues from product sales  and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect 
while our cash resources would permit us to continue through december   we would need to further reduce expenses in advance of that date in the event that we are unable to complete a financing  strategic or commercial transaction in the near term to ensure that we have sufficient capital to meet our obligations and continue on a path designed to create and preserve stockholder value 
the sufficiency of our current cash resources and our need for additional capital  and the timing thereof  will depend on many factors  including primarily the extent of our sales and marketing efforts related to our commercialized products and the amount of revenues that we receive from product sales  as well as other factors described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
we are currently seeking a range of financing and strategic alternatives and have engaged allen company llc to help us evaluate our strategic alternatives 
a member of our board of directors  john simon  is a managing director at allen company llc 
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain a credit facility  enter into product development  license or distribution agreements with third parties or divest one or more of our commercialized products or products in development 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in significant dilution to our stockholders  particularly in light of the prices at which our common stock has been recently trading 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities  new investors could have rights superior to our existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any product development  licensing  distribution or sale agreements that we enter into may require us to relinquish valuable rights  including with respect to commercialized products or products in development that we would otherwise seek to commercialize or develop ourselves 
we believe that the general economic and credit market crisis have created a more difficult environment for obtaining equity and debt financing or strategic transactions  and we may not be able to obtain sufficient additional financing or enter into a strategic transaction in a timely manner 
our need to raise capital soon may require us to accept terms that may harm our business or be disadvantageous to our current stockholders  particularly in light of the current illiquidity and instability in the global financial markets 
agreements with cook incorporated in june  we entered into  and in september and in june amended  a license  development and commercialization agreement with cook incorporated  or cook  to develop and commercialize a specialized device  referred to as the pfo device  designed to close holes in the heart from genetic heart defects known as patent foramen ovales  or pfos 
under the agreement  cook funds certain development activities and we and cook jointly develop the device 
once developed  cook receives an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license  with the right to grant sublicenses  to make  have made  use  sell  offer for sale and import the pfo device 
under this agreement  we have received payments totaling million  million and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we recorded as development revenue under the agreement a total of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  and none in fiscal year a total of  under this agreement has been recorded as deferred development revenue on the balance sheet as of june  we are also entitled to receive from cook up to a total of an additional  in future payments if development milestones under the agreement are achieved 
we are also entitled to receive a royalty based on cook s annual worldwide sales of the pfo device  if any 
on december   we entered into  and in september amended and in july amended and partially terminated  an agreement with cook to develop the cook vascular closure device 
under the agreement  cook funded certain development activities  and we and cook jointly developed the device  under the direction of a 
table of contents development committee that included representatives from each party 
under the original agreement and the first amendment in september  cook received an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license  with the right to grant sublicenses  to make  have made  use  sell  offer for sale and import the cook vascular closure device for medical procedures in any part of the body 
under this agreement  we received payments totaling approximately million  including million  million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
we recorded as development revenue under the agreement a total of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in july  we entered into a partial termination and second amendment of this agreement to terminate cook s participation in the project and to provide to cook a royalty on net sales of the cook vascular closure device if cardica successfully commercializes the product 
the remaining deferred revenue balance was recognized as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal as we had completed all of our activities under the agreement and no amounts are refundable to cook under the partial termination agreement 
in addition  during fiscal year  we recognized a total of  of product sales to cook of the cook vascular closure device 
deficiency letter from the nasdaq global market on may   we announced that we received a letter  dated may   from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq stock market notifying us that we did not comply with the million minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq global market set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule b a 
nasdaq s determination was based on a review of our quarterly report on form q for the period ended march  as provided in the nasdaq rules  we timely submitted to the nasdaq staff a plan to continue listing on the nasdaq global market 
nasdaq granted us an extension until september   to regain compliance with the listing standards 
on september   we received a second letter from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq stock market notifying us of its determination that we had failed to meet the terms of the extension because we failed to publicly disclose a compliant stockholders equity balance by september  pursuant to the nasdaq rules we appealed the decision to a nasdaq listing qualifications panel and requested a hearing 
the hearing is scheduled for october  our common stock will remain listed on the nasdaq global market pending a decision by the panel following the hearing 
in the event we are unable to otherwise satisfy the continued listing criteria of the nasdaq global market and our appeal is denied we may apply for listing on the nasdaq capital market 
we believe that we currently meet the listing requirements of that market  including the requirement to have a minimum of million in stockholders equity 
even if we are able to regain compliance with the listing requirements of the nasdaq global market  there is no assurance that in the future we will continue to satisfy such listing requirements  with the result that our common stock may be delisted from that market and we may not meet the listing requirements of the nasdaq capital market at such time 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they require us to make significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify 
table of contents that title has transferred 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  then the recognition of revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we record product sales net of estimated product returns and discounts from the list prices for our products 
the amounts of product returns and the discount amounts have not been material to date 
we include shipping and handling costs in cost of product sales 
revenue generated from development contracts is recognized when it is earned and non refundable upon receipt of milestone payments or upon incurrence of the related development expenses in accordance with contractual terms  based on the actual costs incurred to date plus overhead costs for certain project activities 
amounts paid but not yet earned on the project are refundable and are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the related development expenses are incurred 
inventory 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
standard costs are monitored on a quarterly basis and updated as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
inventory write downs are established when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand or reductions in selling prices 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value 
inventory write downs are charged to cost of product sales and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and the risk of lower customer demand levels 
while we believe the current value of inventories represents all known and estimated changes in demand  we have recently experienced reduced demand for our c port systems and further unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory write downs that could adversely impact our financial results 
clinical trial accounting 
clinical trial costs are a component of research and development expenses and include fees paid to participating hospitals and other service providers that conduct clinical trial activities with patients on our behalf and the cost of clinical trial insurance 
the various costs of the trial are contractually based on the nature of the services  and we accrue the costs as the services are provided 
accrued costs are based on estimates of the work completed under the service agreements  patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts 
our estimate of the work completed and associated costs to be accrued  includes our assessment of information received from our third party service providers and the overall status of our clinical trial activities 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate costs associated with various trials at a given point in time 
although our experience in estimating these costs is limited  the difference between accrued expenses based on our estimates and actual expenses have not been material to date 
stock based compensation 
during fiscal year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
under sfas no 
r stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee requisite service period 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and its interpretations 
we adopted sfas no 
r applying the prospective method under which we will continue to account for nonvested equity awards outstanding at the date of adoption of sfas no 
r in the same manner as they had been accounted for prior to adoption  that is  we will continue to apply apb no 
in future periods to equity awards outstanding at the date we adopted sfas no 
r 
the expected term of options granted under sfas no 
r is determined using the simplified method allowed by sab no 
 as extended by sab no 
under this approach  the expected term is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
since the company has limited historical data on volatility of its stock  the expected volatility is based on volatility of similar entities referred to as guideline companies 
in evaluating similarity  the company considered factors such as industry  stage of life 
table of contents cycle  size  and financial leverage 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a risk free zero coupon spot interest rate at the time of grant 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
sfas no 
r requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for options and restricted stock awards using the accelerated method over the requisite service period of the award  which generally equals the vesting period of each grant 
we recorded stock based compensation expense under sfas r of million  or per share  million  or per share  and  or per share for fiscal years  and  respectively 
total compensation expense related to unvested awards not yet recognized is approximately million at june  and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  certain stock options were granted with exercise prices that were below the estimated fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation  net of cancellations due to terminated employees  of million in fiscal year  in accordance with apb no 
 and will amortize this amount on a straight line basis over the related vesting period of the options 
we recorded employee stock based compensation expense associated with the amortization of deferred stock compensation of   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the total unamortized deferred stock compensation recorded for all option grants as of june  of  is expected to be fully amortized in fiscal year results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net revenue 
net revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year net product sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in product sales for the fiscal year ended june  was primarily the result of the introduction of our pas port system in the united states

in addition  in the third quarter of fiscal year we received low orders from our distributor in japan and did not receive a significant order in the fourth quarter for japan 
we are transitioning to a sales force made up primarily of independent manufacturers representatives and distributors 
the new sales representatives need to be recruited and trained and future quarterly product sales may be lower than comparable quarters until we complete this transition period 
for fiscal years and  sales to century medical  inc  our distributor in japan  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total product sales 
development revenue was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the total was comprised of million for development activities for the pfo device under a development agreement with cook that we entered into in june  and million for development activities for the cook vascular closure device under a separate development agreement with cook 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales consists primarily of material  labor and overhead costs 
cost of product sales increased  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in cost of product sales in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased unit sales of all of our products worldwide  due primarily to increased adoption of pas port systems in the united states  of  an excess reserve on c port raw materials of  and higher production scrap expense of  for the pas port system  offset in part by lower warranty charges of  and decreased lower of cost or market reserves of

research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs within our product development  regulatory and clinical groups and the costs of clinical trials 
research and development expense decreased  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the net decrease in research and development expense in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable to a decrease in salaries and benefits of  due primarily to a net decrease in the number of personnel  decreased prototype project materials for the c port xv and cook projects of  lower non cash stock based compensation expenses of  and lower clinical trial expense of  as a result of completing the pas port trials  offset by higher molds and tooling expenses of  related to retirement of certain assets for the c port xv system  which is no longer under development since the c port x change ii system performs a comparable function while offering additional features and has nearly caught up to the c port xv system in development  and higher facilities costs of we anticipate that research and development expenses will decrease in absolute terms in fiscal year due to the restructuring and reductions in headcount completed in january to may selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of costs for administrative and sales and marketing personnel  intellectual property and marketing expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the net increase in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable to higher sales and marketing expenses to support field sales activities in the united states to sell c port systems and pas port systems  including increased salaries and benefits of  higher non cash stock based compensation expenses of  higher recruiting fees of  due to the expansion of the sales force and higher product demonstration and trade show expense of  offset in part by lower accounting and auditing fees of  primarily related to our change in filing status to be a non accelerated filer  and lower legal expense of  due to lower litigation expense in fiscal based on the settlement reached in fiscal year we expect selling  general and administrative expense to decrease in absolute terms in fiscal year due to the restructuring and reductions in headcount completed in january to may interest income 
interest income decreased  or  to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the decrease in interest income in fiscal year was primarily attributable to lower average investment balances available for investing during the period and lower overall market interest rates for the fiscal year

also contributing to the increase of product sales in fiscal year were the higher average selling prices of the c port flex a and c port x change systems sold during the period when compared to the average selling price of the c port xa system 
net product sales in fiscal year included only months of c port flex a system sales as this product received fda clearance in march and no sales of the c port x change system as this system was introduced in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal year development revenue for fiscal year totaling million was comprised of million for development activities for the pfo device under a development agreement with cook that we entered into in june  and million for development activities for the cook vascular closure device under a separate development agreement with cook

income taxes due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of our deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no benefit has been recognized for the net operating loss and other deferred tax assets 
accordingly  deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established as of june  and to reflect these uncertainties 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 or fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on july  as a result  upon the implementation of fin no 
 we recognized no liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits

we cannot be certain that additional funding of any kind will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations

it also requires the disclosure of the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the standard did not result in significant changes in the practice of subsequent event disclosures or the related accounting thereof  and therefore the adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
establishes the fasb accounting standards codification as the single source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards  other than guidance issued by the sec  sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  including structured finance  special purpose or variable interest entities
