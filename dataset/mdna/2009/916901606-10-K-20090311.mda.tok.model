we do not undertake to update  revise or correct any of the forward looking information 
readers are cautioned that such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading risk factors beginning on page overview uri explores for and produces uranium in south texas where it has three production operations kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita 
uri also has an estimated million pounds of in place mineralized uranium material on  acres in new mexico 
our operations are heavily influenced by the price of uranium both on the spot and long tem markets 
the spot price of uranium  which has fluctuated from a high of lb in june to its recent price level of lb  has been the primary driver of the strategic decisions of the company 
our strategy has been focused on two fronts advancing our new mexico assets towards production  and expanding our reserve base in texas so we can continue to generate cash from operations to sustain our efforts in new mexico 
throughout  we have had to adjust our plans in response to changes in the uranium market 
operating margins from our production are impacted by uranium prices and costs 
although uranium prices escalated rapidly from to  so did costs 
in  while prices declined  costs did not  leading to a significant decrease in margins 
as a result  in october we decided to suspend new wellfield development at kingsville and rosita until sufficient margins can be made to justify the new investment required to bring on additional production 
south texas production we produced  pounds of uranium from our south texas operations in at december   we had only two operating wellfields remaining at kingsville dome that are expected to complete their production by the end of march current activity at kingsville dome is primarily focused on the restoration of depleted wellfields 
the last wellfield at vasquez was fully depleted in october and the project is now undergoing restoration 
production from rosita was started in june  but was suspended in october due to poor economics driven by increased operating costs as a result of technical operating challenges and the decreased price of uranium 

table of contents the company believes it has sufficient in place mineralized uranium material to produce a total of  to  pounds uo over a one to two year period should realized uranium prices recover to the level of per pound uo  the current long term uranium price 
a new wellfield typically requires to months to install and to months to mine out 
the company has deferred all activities for delineating or developing wellfields until a stronger pricing environment is realized 
reserve development a significant portion of the cash on hand at december  was generated from the million in net proceeds received from the sale of common stock and warrants in a private placement in may the equity was raised to fund the acquisition  exploration  permitting and development of new and existing properties in south texas to increase our resource base in an effort to extend production at our texas operations beyond and for general corporate purposes 
during  we conducted drilling activities on several of our exploration targets including holes on the marshall property  holes at the south rosita property and holes on the cooke property 
we found significant mineralization on the marshall property  however  further evaluations need to be completed to determine if this property can be mined by isr methods 
we also have completed some initial drilling on the mosser property 
at kingsville  we conducted exploration drilling on our potential extension to production area authorization known as paa extension  but suspended drilling in the fourth quarter due to poor results 
a preliminary program to identify additional reserves within production area have had mixed results to date and have been put on hold 
due to higher costs  combined with geologic and technical risk and unknown market risk  we have chosen to suspend our exploration activities until the economics justify further activity 
we are seeking opportunities for the rights to potential uranium properties in south texas in geographic areas that have historically held significant uranium resources 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in the acquisition of such properties  or if acquired  that such properties will contain commercially viable uranium deposits 
financial condition and results of operations comparison of twelve months ended december   and production and production costs 
our uranium production was  pounds in   pounds in and  pounds in production began at our vasquez project in the fourth quarter of and reached peak production output in in and we saw a decline in vasquez production and the start up of production from our kingsville dome project 
this trend continued in and the start up of production from kingsville dome wellfield in january  the first new production from our production area at kingsville dome resulted in the production increases in over our production output 
in  we placed five new wellfields into production at kingsville dome and one new wellfield at vasquez 
these wellfields were less prolific than the wellfields produced in three of the kingsville dome wellfields and the vasquez wellfields were produced out in the remaining two wellfields at kingsville dome are expected to complete production by the end of march production at our rosita project began with oxygen injection in june and resulted in low levels of production using our standard in situ recovery mining techniques 
in late july  we employed a series of alternative operational strategies including the use of various oxidants in an attempt to improve recovery levels 
while these tests did improve production over previous levels  the higher cost of production combined with lower uranium prices did not allow the operation to continue on a positive cash basis and production was suspended in the th quarter of although technically challenging  we believe the reserves from rosita can be produced economically with higher uranium prices 

table of contents we completed production at the vasquez project and shut in production at the rosita project in the th quarter of and we expect to shut in production at the kingsville dome project by the end of march the vasquez project was mined out in and is now being restored 
at the kingsville dome and rosita projects  we shut in production to conserve the in place reserve base in response to a drop in uranium market prices 
we do not intend to resume production at these sites until there is a significant recovery of uranium prices 
the following table details our production and production cost breakdown for the year ended december   and kingsville dome production vasquez production rosita production total production total operating costs per pound operating costs total depreciation and depletion costs per pound dd a cost total production cost production cost per pound total operating costs  total depreciation and depletion costs and total production costs incurred for the periods presented above differ from the cost of uranium sales recorded in consolidated statements of operations because of changes in the amounts recorded to inventory for the same periods 
the cost of uranium sales amounts include the sales of uranium inventory on hand at the beginning of the period and does not include uranium produced during the period but not sold at period end 
the following table provides a reconciliation of production costs to cost of uranium sales for the year ended december   and operating costs change in uranium inventory operating expense for uranium production sold depreciation and depletion costs change in uranium inventory depreciation and depletion for uranium production sold total production costs change in uranium inventory direct cost of uranium production sold our direct production costs in increased compared with costs 
these total cost increases resulted from production being sourced from higher cost kingsville dome and vasquez wellfields in and from the unfavorable results we saw from our rosita production in the current year 
uranium sales 
in  we sold a total of  pounds of uranium produced from our kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita projects  resulting in revenue of million 
in  we sold a total of  pounds of uranium produced from our kingsville dome and vasquez projects  resulting 
table of contents in revenue of million 
in  we sold a total of  pounds of uranium produced from our kingsville dome and vasquez projects  resulting in revenue of million 
cost of uranium sales 
our direct production costs for uranium sales made in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the amounts were exclusive of a gain on derivatives of million recorded in connection with our amended uranium sales contracts 
our total cost of uranium sales is comprised of such production costs  including operating expenses  depreciation and depletion expenses  and also includes royalties and commissions related to our uranium sales  amortization of our restoration and reclamation cost estimates  exploration costs incurred during the year and impairment provisions for uranium properties 
the following table details our production and royalties commissions cost of uranium sales breakdown for the years ended december   and total pounds sold total operating expenses per pound operating expense depreciation and depletion per pound dd a expense direct cost of uranium production sold direct cost of sales per pound royalties and commissions royalties and commissions per pound our kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita projects all experienced higher production costs in than our production from kingsville dome and vasquez in the higher costs at kingsville dome and vasquez were the result of production being sourced from lesser quality ore reserves and the wind down of production at each of these projects during the year 
as the production life of a wellfield extends  the costs to produce those pounds is higher than when a wellfield is first placed into production 
since no new capital expenditures were made in the latter part of the year to bring on new wellfields  there was no new lower cost production to offset the higher latter stage production we experienced at these two projects 
the production difficulties we experienced at rosita forced us to try a number of non standard methodologies in an attempt to increase our production efficiencies 
the costs incurred and the lack of significant progress in resolving our production inefficiencies at rosita without committing to a capital expenditure program to increase the number of production wells resulted in our high production costs at rosita during the year 
our average cost of pounds sold in was per pound with kingsville dome production contributing approximately  vasquez pounds totaling approximately and rosita contributing approximately of total pounds sold during the year 
we saw an improvement in our overall production costs in compared with with the majority of our production in coming from new wellfields at our kingsville dome project  we saw benefits of this historically lower cost production contributing significantly to reducing both our operating and capital costs of production in our average cost of pounds sold in was per pound with kingsville dome production contributing approximately and vasquez pounds totaling approximately of the total pounds sold during the year 
our average cost of pounds sold was for these costs resulted from our incurring both higher operating and capital costs in and were primarily caused by inefficiencies at our vasquez project 
we encountered chemical and permeability obstacles in the vasquez project s formation which caused us to attempt a variety of new operating techniques including the use of different oxidizing components and more concentrated drilling patterns for our wellfields 
these and other attempted solutions did not have the desired effect of increasing the production rates and reducing our operating 
table of contents and capital costs at vasquez 
the cost of pounds sold includes operating expenses and depreciation and depletion 
these costs for include a cumulative million related to lower of cost or market inventory adjustments made quarterly 
the adjustments resulted from the book carrying value of our uranium inventory exceeding the expected market value of the inventory 
these adjustments had the effect of reducing the carrying value of the uranium inventory and accelerating the timing of recording operating expenses and depreciation and depletion recorded in the statement of operations for each quarter 
the cost of goods sold for exclude  per pound from a lower of cost or market adjustment made in december for  pounds of vasquez inventory at that date that were sold in the first quarter of royalties and commissions 
during  royalties and commissions for kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita production sold was million  representing a charge of of sales 
during  royalties and commissions for vasquez and kingsville dome production sold was million  representing a charge of of sales 
during  royalties and commissions for vasquez and kingsville dome production sold was  or of sales 
the changes in royalty percentages from to and resulted primarily from the changes in uranium sales prices year to year and the source for our production in each year 
our vasquez leases contain a sliding scale royalty with percentages that range from up to dependent on our sales prices 
the increase in royalties from to resulted from production activities in at our kingsville dome project from leases which have a royalty and carry an additional royalty payment to certain land owners of the property which have ratified lease agreements with the company 
our rosita leases contain royalty rates 
operating expenses 
during  operating expenses for kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita production sold was million

during  we incurred depreciation and depletion expense attributable to our vasquez and kingsville dome production of million 
during  we incurred depreciation and depletion expense attributable to our vasquez and kingsville dome production of million 
impairment of uranium properties 
during  and  we determined the carrying value of our uranium project assets exceeded their fair value as provided in sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
such determination in resulted in an impairment provision of million 
the impairment provision reduced the carrying value of kingsville dome by million  rosita by million and vasquez by million at december  the impairment provision in and resulted primarily from our reducing the estimated recoverable reserves projected to be produced from vasquez in the future and resulted in an impairment provision related to the vasquez project assets of approximately  and million in and  respectively 
accretion and amortization of future restoration costs 
during  and  the accretion and amortization of future restoration costs was   and  respectively 
general and administrative charges 
we incurred general and administrative charges and corporate depreciation of million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents significant expenditures for general and administrative expenses for year ended december   and were year ended amounts in s stock compensation expense salaries and payroll burden legal  accounting  public company expenses writeoff of target acquisition costs insurance and bank fees consulting and professional services office expenses travel and other expenses total the non cash compensation expense recorded for the years ended december   and resulted from the adoption of sfas r in january  requiring the recognition of expense related to the company s stock option grants 
the value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the option award and stock price volatility 
the expected term of options granted was derived from historical data on our employee exercise and post vesting employment termination experience 
the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our stock 
salary and payroll costs were up slightly in compared with the  or increase resulted primarily from increased personnel and benefits and a reduction in personnel costs allocated to operations and projects during the current year 
salary and payroll cost increases of million in compared with resulted primarily from the addition of salaried positions primarily in south texas and new mexico during the year and the cash bonus awarded to non executive employees at year end the company s legal  accounting and public company expenses had a net decrease of  in compared with the decrease related to lower sarbanes oxley section sox audit related costs in and nasdaq listing fees  decreased directors fees and costs related to the preparation for a planned listing on the toronto stock exchange incurred in the company s legal  accounting and public company expenses had a net increase of  in compared with the primary increases in these costs were from sox audit related costs  nasdaq listing fees  higher directors fees related to the addition of two independent directors during and an increased directors participation in strategic planning activities and costs related to the preparation for a planned listing on the toronto stock exchange 
these increased costs were somewhat offset by a reduction of legal costs charged to general and administrative costs during the year 
the primary reduction related to a significant amount of legal activity in related to the negotiation and preparation of the joint venture in new mexico with itochu corporation 
the company s legal  accounting and public company expenses increased for the year from the increase in transactions and activities occurring in compared to such activities included the renegotiation of the company s long term sales contracts  the negotiation of a joint venture in new mexico with itochu corporation  increased costs to conduct the annual shareholder meeting  an increase in the number of board of directors meetings and preparation of the company s nasdaq application listing

insurance costs increased in compared to primarily as a result of an increase in our general liability premiums  these premiums rose during the year as a result of increases in production activities seen in compared with the prior year 
we also had increases in our property and casualty premiums resulting from increased vehicle coverage because additional vehicles acquired in bank fees also increased in as a result of additions made to our financial surety requirements for our south texas uranium projects 
the costs for consulting and professional services decreased by  compared with and was related primarily to a reduction in costs for financial advisory services provided by a non employee director of the company in 
the costs for consulting and professional services increased by million compared with the increased costs were a result of heightened activities involving work performed to review and assess our new mexico property data bases for their evaluation as potential conventional mining projects  the expansion of a broad community relations and community information education effort in both south texas and new mexico  investor relations costs  costs for financial advisory services provided by a non employee director of the company  and other advisory fees in texas increased office costs in compared with resulted primarily from the full year costs of the lewisville  texas and albuquerque  new mexico offices offset by cost reductions realized by the closure of the corpus christi office mid year increased office costs in compared with resulted primarily from the opening of a new corporate office location in albuquerque  new mexico  in october   the move of the corporate headquarters to larger office space in september  the costs for the corpus christi office for the entire year and increases in the south texas kingsville operations office resulting from the personnel added during the year 
write off of target acquisition costs 
in june  the company and billiton investment bv agreed to terminate our agreement to purchase rio algom mining  llc  which was entered into on october  in connection with the targeted acquisition  we incurred costs of million dollars which were originally recorded as a pre acquisition cost asset 
upon the termination of the agreement these pre acquisition costs were expensed in net income loss 
for the year ended december  we had a net loss of million compared to a net income of million in and net income of million in on a diluted per share basis  losses were in compared with earnings of and in and  respectively

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies involve those requiring the use of significant estimates and assumptions in determining values or projecting future costs 
specifically regarding our uranium properties  significant estimates were utilized in determining the carrying value of these assets 
these assets have been recorded at their estimated net realizable value for impairment purposes on a liquidation basis  which is less than our cost 
the actual value realized from these assets may vary significantly from these estimates based upon market conditions  financing availability and other factors 
regarding our reserve for future restoration and reclamation costs  significant estimates were utilized in determining the future costs to complete the groundwater restoration and surface reclamation at our mine sites 
the actual cost to conduct these activities may vary significantly from these estimates 
such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
the accounts of the company are maintained in united states dollars 
all dollar amounts in the financial statements are stated in united states dollars except where indicated

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk uranium price volatility the company is subject to market risk related to the market price of uranium 
the company s cash flow has historically been dependent on the price of uranium  which is determined primarily by global supply and demand  relative to the company s costs of production 
historically  uranium prices have been subject to fluctuation  and the price of uranium has been and will continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond the company s control  including the demand for nuclear power  political and economic conditions  and governmental legislation in uranium producing and consuming countries and production levels and costs of production of other producing companies 
the spot market price for uranium has demonstrated a large range since january prices have risen from per pound at january to a high of per pound as of june and are as of march
