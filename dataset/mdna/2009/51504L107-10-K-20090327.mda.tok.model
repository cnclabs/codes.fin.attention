these loans were located in deteriorating neighborhoods and were originally obtained as part of an acquisition 
as of december  the loans were partially charged off and have subsequently been liquidated in at a price that had an immaterial impact on earnings 
as mentioned above  these loans were acquired in a prior acquisition and are not representative of the quality and performance of the remaining one to four family residential mortgage loan portfolio 

table of contents the distribution of the company s allowance for losses on loans at the dates indicated and the percent of loans in each category to total loans is summarized in the following table 
this allocation reflects management s judgment as to risks inherent in the types of loans indicated  but the general allowance included in the table are not restricted and are available to absorb all loan losses

amount loan type to total loans amount loan type to total loans amount loan type to total loans dollars in thousands real estate loans one to four family residential commercial construction commercial consumer total the decline in the allocation of the allowance for losses on loans to one to four family residential loans is primarily the result of the charge off associated with the one loan relationship on a pool of non owner occupied  one to four family residential loans in the kansas city  missouri area 
specific reserve allocations of  related to impaired loans at december  was primarily related to one commercial loan relationship 
the allowance for losses on loans is discussed in more detail in the nonperforming assets and asset quality and distribution sections  we believe the company s allowance for loan losses continues to be adequate based on the company s evaluation of the loan portfolio s inherent risk as of december  even though the company s levels of non accrual loans and loans over days past due declined during  the current economic problems could result in our levels of nonperforming assets staying elevated  as compared to levels prior to december   for a significant period of time

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors our business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 
the united states has been in a recession since december  business activity across a wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced and many businesses and local governments are experiencing serious difficulty in remaining profitable and providing services due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
unemployment has increased significantly 
since mid  and particularly during the second half of  the financial services industry and the securities markets generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity 
this was initially triggered by declines in home prices and the values of subprime mortgages  but spread to all mortgage and real estate asset classes  to leveraged bank loans and to nearly all asset classes  including equities 
the global markets have been characterized by substantially increased volatility and short selling and an overall loss of investor confidence  initially in financial institutions  but more recently in companies in a number of other industries and in the broader markets 
market conditions have also led to the failure or merger of a number of prominent financial institutions 
financial institution failures or near failures have resulted in further losses as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them and defaults under contracts entered into with such entities as counterparties 
furthermore  declining asset values  defaults on mortgages and consumer loans  and the lack of market and investor confidence  as well as other factors  have all combined to increase credit default swap spreads  to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings  and to otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability of liquidity  despite very significant declines in federal reserve borrowing rates and other government actions 
some banks and other lenders have suffered significant losses and have become reluctant to lend  even on a secured basis  due to the increased risk of default and the impact of declining asset values on the value of collateral 
the foregoing has significantly weakened the strength and liquidity of some financial institutions worldwide 
in  the us government  the federal reserve and other regulators have taken numerous steps to increase liquidity and to restore investor confidence  including committing to invest at least billion in the equity of other banking organizations  but asset values have continued to decline and access to liquidity for many organizations continues to be very limited 
as a result of these financial economic crises  many lending institutions  including us  have experienced declines in the performance of their loans  including commercial loans  commercial real estate loans and consumer loans 
moreover  competition among depository institutions for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline 
bank and bank holding company stock prices have been negatively affected  as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets has become more difficult compared to recent years 
as a result  there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  including the expected issuance of many formal or informal enforcement actions or orders 
the impact of new legislation in response to those developments  may negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations  including our ability to originate or sell loans  and adversely impact our financial performance or our stock price 
in addition  further negative market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may impact our charge offs and provision for credit losses 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial services industry 
declines in our stock price  as well as changes to other risk factors discussed herein  could result in impairment of our goodwill which would have an adverse effect on our earnings 

table of contents overall  during the past year  the general business environment has had an adverse effect on our business  and there can be no assurance that the environment will improve in the near term 
until conditions improve  we expect our business  financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected 
our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio 
we established our allowance for loan losses and maintain it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb loan losses that are inherent in the portfolio 
additionally  our board of directors regularly monitors the adequacy of our allowance for loan loses 
the amount of future loan losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  which may be beyond our control  and such losses may exceed current estimates 
at december  and  our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and  respectively  and as a percentage of total non performing loans was approximately and  respectively 
although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans that may become uncollectible  we cannot predict loan losses with certainty nor can we assure you that our allowance for loan losses will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
loan losses in excess of our reserves may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the increased levels of provision for loan losses experienced during may continue for some period of time 
declines in value may adversely impact the carrying amount of our investment portfolio and result in other than temporary impairment charges 
as of december   we had pooled trust preferred securities with an aggregate book value of million and an unrealized loss of approximately million 
we may be required to record impairment charges on our investment securities if they suffer a decline in value that is considered other than temporary 
if the credit quality of the securities in our investment portfolio deteriorates  we may also experience a loss in interest income from the suspension of either interest or dividend payments 
numerous factors  including lack of liquidity for resales of certain investment securities  absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities  adverse changes in business climate or adverse actions by regulators could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio in future periods 
our concentration of one to four family residential mortgage loans may result in lower yields and profitability 
one to four family residential mortgage loans comprised million and million  or and  of our loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
these loans are secured primarily by properties located in the state of kansas 
our concentration of these loans results in lower yields relative to other loan categories within our loan portfolio 
while these loans generally possess higher yields than investment securities  their repayment characteristics are not as well defined and they generally possess a higher degree of interest rate risk versus other loans and investment securities within our portfolio 
this increased interest rate risk is due to the repayment and prepayment options inherent in residential mortgage loans which are exercised by borrowers based upon the overall level of interest rates 
these residential mortgage loans are generally made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayments from his or her employment and the value of the property securing the loan 
thus  as a result  repayment of these loans is also subject to general economic and employment conditions within the communities and surrounding areas where the property is located 
the effects of ongoing mortgage market challenges  combined with the ongoing correction in residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales  has the potential to adversely affect our one to four family residential mortgage portfolio in several ways  each of which could adversely affect our operating results and or financial condition 
commercial loans make up a significant portion of our loan portfolio 
commercial loans were million  or approximately of our total loan portfolio as of december   compared to million and as of december  our commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 

table of contents most often  this collateral is accounts receivable  inventory  or machinery 
credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee  if any exists 
as a result  in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
the collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
our agricultural loans involve a greater degree of risk than other loans  and the ability of the borrower to repay may be affected by many factors outside of the borrower s control 
at december  and  agricultural real estate loans totaled million and million  or and of our total loan portfolio  respectively 
agricultural real estate lending involves a greater degree of risk and typically involves larger loans to single borrowers than lending on single family residences 
payments on agricultural real estate loans are dependent on the profitable operation or management of the farm property securing the loan 
the success of the farm may be affected by many factors outside the control of the farm borrower  including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields such as hail  drought and floods  loss of livestock due to disease or other factors  declines in market prices for agricultural products both domestically and internationally and the impact of government regulations including changes in price supports  subsidies and environmental regulations 
in addition  many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm 
if the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
the primary crops in our market areas are wheat  corn and soybean 
accordingly  adverse circumstances affecting wheat  corn and soybean crops could have an adverse effect on our agricultural real estate loan portfolio 
we also originate agricultural operating loans 
at december  and  these loans totaled million and million  respectively  or and respectively  of our total loan portfolio 
as with agricultural real estate loans  the repayment of operating loans is dependent on the successful operation or management of the farm property 
likewise  agricultural operating loans involve a greater degree of risk than lending on residential properties  particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as farm equipment  livestock or crops 
we generally secure agricultural operating loans with a blanket lien on livestock  equipment  food  hay  grain and crops 
nevertheless  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage  loss or depreciation 
our business is concentrated in and dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of the markets in which we operate  including eastern  central and southwestern kansas 
we operate primarily in eastern  central and southwestern kansas  and as a result  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes in the economic conditions in those areas 
although each market we operate in is geographically and economically diverse  our success depends upon the business activity  population  income levels  deposits and real estate activity in each of these markets 
although our customers business and financial interests may extend well beyond our market area  adverse economic conditions that affect our specific market area could reduce our growth rate  affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations 
because of our geographic concentration  we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets 
we may experience difficulties in managing our growth and our growth strategy involves risks that may negatively impact our net income 
as part of our general strategy  we may acquire banks and related businesses that we believe provide a strategic fit with our business 
in the past  we have acquired a number of local banks and  to the extent that we continue to grow through future acquisitions  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately and profitably manage this growth 
acquiring other banks and businesses will involve risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including 
table of contents potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired bank or related business  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of banks and businesses we acquire  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of our management s time and attention  and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks and businesses we acquire 
in addition to acquisitions  we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets by undertaking additional branch openings 
we believe that it generally takes several years for new banking facilities to first achieve operational profitability  due to the impact of organization and overhead expenses and the start up phase of generating loans and deposits 
to the extent that we undertake additional branch openings  we are likely to continue to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations  which may have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income  return on average equity and return on average assets 
we face intense competition in all phases of our business from other banks and financial institutions 
the banking and financial services business in our market is highly competitive 
our competitors include large regional banks  local community banks  savings and loan associations  securities and brokerage companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies  finance companies  money market mutual funds  credit unions and other non bank financial service providers  many of which have greater financial  marketing and technological resources than us 
increased competition in our market may result in a decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits  reduced spreads between loan rates and deposit rates or loan terms that are more favorable to the borrower 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and remain profitable 
if increased competition causes us to significantly discount the interest rates we offer on loans or increase the amount we pay on deposits  our net interest income could be adversely impacted 
if increased competition causes us to relax our underwriting standards  we could be exposed to higher losses from lending activities 
additionally  many of our competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization  have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer 
interest rates and other conditions impact our results of operations 
our profitability is in part a function of the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
like most banking institutions  our net interest spread and margin will be affected by general economic conditions and other factors  including fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government  that influence market interest rates and our ability to respond to changes in such rates 
at any given time  our assets and liabilities will be such that they are affected differently by a given change in interest rates 
as a result  an increase or decrease in rates  the length of loan terms or the mix of adjustable and fixed rate loans in our portfolio could have a positive or negative effect on our net income  capital and liquidity 
we measure interest rate risk under various rate scenarios and using specific criteria and assumptions 
a summary of this process  along with the results of our net interest income simulations is presented in the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable and effectively managed  significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must effectively manage our credit risk 
there are risks inherent in making any loan  including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers  risks of nonpayment  risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions 
we attempt to minimize our credit risk through prudent loan application approval procedures  careful monitoring of the concentration of our loans within specific industries and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by our credit review department 
however  we cannot assure you that such approval and monitoring procedures will reduce these credit risks 
most of our loans are commercial  real estate  or consumer 
table of contents loans  each of which is subject to distinct types of risk 
to reduce the lending risks we face  we generally take a security interest in borrowers property for all three types of loans 
in addition  we sell certain residential real estate loans to third parties 
nevertheless  the risk of non payment is inherent in all three types of loans and if we are unable to collect amounts owed  it may materially affect our operations and financial performance 
for a more complete discussion of our lending activities see part of item of this annual report on form k 
our loan portfolio has a large concentration of real estate loans  which involve risks specific to real estate value 
real estate lending including commercial  construction  and residential is a large portion of our loan portfolio 
these categories were million  or approximately of our total loan portfolio as of december   as compared to million  or approximately  as of december  the market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located 
although a significant portion of such loans are secured by real estate as a secondary form of collateral  adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio 
additionally  real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of the loans generally is dependent  in large part  on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service 
economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties 
if the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled during a time when market conditions are declining or have declined  then we may not be able to realize the amount of security that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan  which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in particular  if the problems that have occurred in the residential real estate and mortgage markets spread to the commercial real estate market  particularly within our market area  the value of collateral securing our real estate loans could decline and the demand for our real estate loans could decrease 
we generally have not experienced a downturn in credit performance by our real estate loan customers  but in light of the uncertainty that exists in the economy and credit markets nationally  there can be no guarantee that we will not experience any deterioration in such performance 
our continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future and this is a major reason why we did not participate in the cpp 
however  we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continuing growth 
our ability to raise additional capital is particularly important to our strategy of continual growth through acquisitions 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired 
our community banking strategy relies heavily on our management team  and the unexpected loss of key managers may adversely affect our operations 
much of our success to date has been influenced strongly by our ability to attract and to retain senior management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in our market area 
our ability to retain executive officers  the current management teams  branch managers and loan officers of our operating subsidiaries will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy 
it is also critical  as we grow  to be able to attract and retain qualified additional management and loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market area to implement our community based operating strategy 
the 
table of contents unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel  or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation can result in limitations on our operations 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to supervision and regulation by a number of governmental regulatory agencies  including the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the fdic and the occ 
regulations adopted by these agencies  which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than for the benefit of stockholders  govern a comprehensive range of matters relating to ownership and control of our shares  our acquisition of other companies and businesses  permissible activities for us to engage in  maintenance of adequate capital levels and other aspects of our operations 
these bank regulators possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law 
the laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time and in light of the recent economic downturn  the industry has experienced a general strengthening of these laws and regulations 
increased regulation could increase our cost of compliance and adversely affect profitability 
for example  new legislation or regulation may limit the manner in which we may conduct our business  including our ability to offer new products  obtain financing  attract deposits  make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads 
we have a continuing need for technological change and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our market area 
many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
as a result  they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer  which would put us at a competitive disadvantage 
accordingly  we cannot provide you with assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers 
there is a limited trading market for our common shares  and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them 
although our common shares are listed for trading on the nasdaq global market under the symbol lark  the trading in our common shares has substantially less liquidity than many other publicly traded companies 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
we cannot assure you that volume of trading in our common shares will increase in the future 
system failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities 
the computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event  as well as from security breaches  denial of service attacks  viruses  worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers 
any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
computer break ins  phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure  which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us 
although we  with the help of third party service providers  intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage  there can be no assurance that these security measures will be 
table of contents successful 
in addition  advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data 
a failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to certain operational risks  including  but not limited to  customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors 
employee errors and misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation 
misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us  improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information 
it is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 
employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence 
we maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks  including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud 
should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence  or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to pay interest on our debt may adversely impact our ability to pay dividends 
our million of subordinated debentures are held by two business trusts that we control 
interest payments on the debentures must be paid before we pay dividends on our capital stock  including our common stock 
we have the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to consecutive quarters 
however  if we elect to defer interest payments  all deferred interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock 
deferral of interest payments could also cause a decline in the market price of our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate profile and overview landmark bancorp  inc is a one bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware and is engaged in the banking business through its wholly owned subsidiary  landmark national bank 
landmark bancorp is listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol lark 
landmark national bank is dedicated to providing quality financial and banking services to its local communities 
our strategy includes continuing a tradition of quality assets while growing our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios 
we are committed to developing relationships with our borrowers and providing a total banking service 
landmark national bank is principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such deposits  together with federal home loan bank borrowings and funds from operations  to originate commercial real estate and non real estate loans  as well as one to four family residential mortgage loans 
landmark national bank also originates small business  multi family residential mortgage  home equity and consumer loans 
although not our primary business function  we do invest in certain investment and mortgage related securities using deposits and other borrowings as funding sources 
our results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
in addition  we are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest earning assets mature or reprice at different times  or at different speeds  than our interest bearing liabilities 
our results of operations are also affected by non interest income  such as service charges  loan fees and gains and losses from the sale of newly originated loans and investments 
our operating expenses  aside from interest expense  principally consist of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy costs  federal deposit insurance costs  data processing expenses and provisions for potential loan losses 
we are significantly impacted by prevailing economic conditions including federal monetary and fiscal policies and federal regulations of financial institutions 
deposit balances are influenced by numerous factors such as competing investments  the level of income and the personal rate of savings within our market areas 
factors influencing lending activities include the demand for housing and the interest rate pricing competition from other lending institutions 
currently  our business consists of ownership of landmark national bank  with its main office in manhattan  kansas and nineteen branch offices in eastern  central and southwestern kansas 
in january  we entered into an agreement to purchase a second branch in lawrence 
the location is near our planned building site and allows us to expedite the planned expansion more quickly and economically 
the branch acquisition will come with approximately million in deposits and million in loans 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those  which are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of investment securities  accounting for income taxes and the accounting related to business acquisitions  all of which involve significant judgment by our management 
we perform periodic and systematic detailed reviews of our lending portfolio to assess overall collectability 
the level of the allowance for loan losses reflects our estimate of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
while these estimates are based on substantive methods for determining allowance requirements  nevertheless  actual outcomes may differ significantly from estimated results 
additional explanation of the methodologies used in establishing this reserve is provided in the asset quality and distribution section 
we report our available for sale investment securities at fair value  and in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
fair value measurements  the company employs valuation techniques which utilize observable inputs when those inputs are available 
these observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing the security  developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company 
when such information is not available  the company employs valuation techniques which utilize unobservable inputs  or those which reflect the company s own assumptions about market participants  based on the best information available in the circumstances 
these valuation methods typically involve cash flow and other financial modeling techniques 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  estimates  or other inputs to the valuation techniques could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
sfas  which requires fair value measurements to be classified as level quoted prices  level based on observable inputs or level based on unobservable inputs is discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our management performs periodic reviews of the investment securities to determine if any investment securities have declined in value which might be considered other than temporary 
if such decline is deemed other than temporary  we would adjust the cost basis of the security by writing down the security to the estimated fair market value through a charge to current period operations 
the market values of securities are affected by changes in interest rates as well credit spreads associated with the issuers 
the company s review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances surrounding each security including the length and severity of the loss  the credit of the borrower and our ability and intent to hold the security until maturity 
the company obtains estimates of the fair value for investments in pooled trust preferred securities from pricing services and by discounting projected cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate in accordance with fsp fas no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
the fair value of the pooled trust preferred securities for disclosure purposes is estimated by considering the reasonableness of the range of fair value estimates provided by a pricing service and the discounted cash values 
the company s review of investments in pooled trust preferred securities is also assessed for the recoverability of cash flows under eitf recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interest 
although we believe that our estimates of the fair values of investment securities to be reasonable  economic and market factors may affect the amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
under fin  an income tax position will be recognized if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained upon irs examination  based upon its technical merits 
once that status is met  the amount recorded will be the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we have also established a valuation allowance on a portion of our deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized 
changes in estimates regarding the actual outcome of these future tax consequences  including the effects of irs examinations and examinations by other state agencies  could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents we have completed several business and asset acquisitions  which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by our management 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined and based on purchase price allocations 
the initial value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
if the carrying value of our goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
our analysis includes a review of stock price and valuation multiples compared to recent acquisition multiples in determining our implied fair value of our goodwill 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets 
performing such a discounted cash flow analysis involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of the benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including the historical cash flows 
due to the number of estimates involved related to the allocation of purchase price and determining the appropriate useful lives of intangible assets  we have identified purchase accounting  and the subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets  as a critical accounting policy 

table of contents comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  summary of performance 
net earnings for decreased  or  to million as compared to the decrease in earnings was primarily due to a million increase in our provision for loan losses 
during our loan loss analysis indicated it was necessary to increase our provision for loan losses based upon our analysis of our loan portfolio as well as deteriorating market conditions 
even though our levels of non accrual and past due loans declined during  increased levels of loan loss provision were warranted given the economic environment  the uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the recession and the loan losses and resulting charge offs experienced during we feel the external risks within the environment which we operate remain present today and will need to be continuously monitored 
we believe that our capital levels  loan portfolio management and our provision for loan losses position us to deal with the economic uncertainties in this challenging environment 
we will continue to monitor economic events closely  along with the performance of our loan portfolio  and take the necessary steps required to address any issues that may arise 
partially offsetting the higher provision for loan losses were gains of  on sales of investment securities and  of gains on the prepayment of two fhlb advances  as well as an increase of  in gains on sales of loans 
market conditions during the second quarter of allowed us to sell longer term  higher yielding us agency obligations while purchasing shorter term  lower yielding mortgage backed obligations at gains that were higher than the reductions in interest income as a result of the transactions 
during  we began a strategy of issuing longer term  fixed rate fhlb advances and repaying shorter term fhlb advances to lengthen our fhlb advance maturities while rates were believed to be at a relatively low point in the rate cycle 
as a result of the prepayment of two million advances  we recognized gains of  which represented the unamortized fair value adjustment required by purchase accounting for a prior acquisition 
the increase in gains on sales of loans was driven by higher origination volumes of residential real estate loans that were sold in the secondary market

interest expense for decreased  or million  to million from million for interest expense on deposits decreased to million  or  from million in contributing to the decline in interest expense was a decline in average interest bearing deposits from million for  to million during  as well as a decline in the average rate from in to in interest expense on borrowings decreased  during to million from million in this decline was the result of lower rates on our average borrowings  which declined to during from in offsetting the lower average rates were higher average balances which increased from million in to million in net interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between income derived from interest earning assets and the expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by both the difference between the rates of interest earned on interest earnings assets and the rates paid on interest bearing 
table of contents liabilities interest rate spread as well as the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for the year ended december  increased  to million compared to the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase in net interest income was due primarily to the decline in our cost of funding outpacing the decline in our yield on interest earning assets  which resulted in our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  increasing to from for and  respectively 
during we were able to reduce our cost of deposits and borrowings enough to offset the lower yield on loans in a market that experienced a dramatic decline in benchmark interest rates that began in late and continued throughout the lower cost of funding allowed us to maintain our net interest margin in markets that had considerable competitive pricing pressures 
we expect these pricing pressures to continue during  which will continue to make maintaining or increasing our net interest margin difficult 
provision for loan losses 
we maintain  and our board of directors monitors  an allowance for losses on loans 
the allowance is established based upon management s periodic evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  review of significant individual loans and collateral  review of delinquent loans  past loss experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  current and expected market conditions  and other factors management deems important 
determining the appropriate level of reserves involves a high degree of management judgment and is based upon historical and projected losses in the loan portfolio and the collateral value of specifically identified problem loans 
additionally  allowance strategies and policies are subject to periodic review and revision in response to a number of factors  including current market conditions  actual loss experience and management s expectations 
the provision for loan losses increased to million for  compared to  for we increased our provision for loan losses based on our analysis of the loan portfolio as well as deteriorating market conditions 
even though our levels of non accrual and past due loans declined from december  to december   increased levels of loan loss provision were warranted given the economic environment and the uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the recession we are currently experiencing 
the company s non accrual loans declined to million at december  from million as of december  the decline was primarily the result of the collection of the outstanding balances of two loan relationships totaling million during and increased charge offs of balances in non accrual at december  net loan charge offs for the year ended december  were million compared to  for the year ended december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of gross loans outstanding  compared to million  or of gross loans outstanding  at december  for further discussion of the provision for loan losses  refer to the asset quality and distribution section 
non interest income 
total non interest income increased million to million for  which was primarily attributable to  in gains on sales of investment securities  a  gain on the prepayment of fhlb advances and increases of  in gains on sales of loans and  in fees and service charges  as compared to the increase in gains on sales of loans were driven by higher origination volumes of residential real estate loans that were sold in the secondary market while the increase in fees and service charges were primarily deposit related 
non interest expense 
total non interest expense increased  an increase of during as compared to the increase was primarily attributable to increases of  in compensation and benefits and  in other non interest expense 
the increase in compensation and benefits was driven primarily by increased staffing levels and general pay increases 
the increased staffing levels were primarily related to increased one to four family residential mortgage loan staff 
the increase in other non interest expenses was primarily the result of  increase in foreclosure and other real estate asset expenses  as well as  of other than temporary impairment charges on certain investment securities 
during our fdic deposit insurance costs were primarily offset by assessment credits that were previously received 
however  during these credits will be fully utilized which will cause a substantial increase in our non interest expense 
we expect our fdic deposit insurance expense to increase approximately  during as compared to due to the expiration of the credits and the increased assessment levels 
this amount does not include the proposed emergency special assessment  which would be approximately  these additional amounts will increase non interest expense

in the latter part of  as the federal reserve lowered interest rates  our loan yields decreased at a faster pace than our deposit costs 
the faster decline in loan yields was largely attributed to increasing competitive pressures resulting from a slowing economy  deteriorating loan pricing  and relatively fewer lending opportunities 
at the same time increasing competition for deposits has limited our ability to lower the costs of deposits as quickly as the loans 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased to  for  compared to  for our regular review of the loan portfolio prompted the increase in our provision  primarily as a result of decreases in credit quality  slowing economic conditions  increased commercial lending and higher nonperforming asset balances

table of contents financial condition although the company has avoided many of the problems caused by the deterioration in residential real estate market values and loan portfolio credit quality  particularly the subprime mortgage sector  the company s asset quality and performance has nonetheless been affected by the declining real estate values  falling consumer confidence  increased unemployment and decreased consumer spending  which have all contributed to a slowing economy and a difficult credit market 
management believes that it continues to have a high quality asset base and solid earnings and anticipates that its efforts to run a high quality financial institution with a sound asset base will continue to create a strong foundation for continued growth and profitability in the future 
asset quality and distribution 
total assets decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  our primary ongoing sources of funds are deposits  fhlb borrowings  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities and proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates and economic conditions 
net loans  excluding loans held for sale  decreased to million as of december  from million at december  the million decline in net loans is primarily the result of the refinancings and paydowns in our one to four family residential loan portfolio exceeding our commercial and commercial real estate loan originations 
we have concentrated on generating commercial and commercial real estate loans over the past few years and are pleased that this segment of our loan portfolio has grown 
despite the decrease in total loans  we continued our balance sheet transition with a net increase of million in commercial and commercial real estate loans  which partially offset declines of million in construction loans and million in one to four family residential loans 
this is consistent with our strategy to continue to reduce portfolio reliance on construction loans and residential mortgage loans  most of which have been acquired in previous acquisitions  while increasing our loan portfolio in the area of commercial lending 
we plan to continue our efforts to grow our commercial and commercial real estate lending activities  as long as we are able to originate loans that meet our credit and asset qualities 
as of december   our commercial loans  including commercial real estate loans  comprised of our loan portfolio  up from at december  as of december   our construction loans comprised of total loans  down from at december  as of december   our one to four family residential loans comprised of total loans  down from at december  we anticipate continuing to diversify our loan portfolio composition through our continued planned expansion of commercial and commercial real estate lending activities and continued refinancings and paydowns in our one to four family residential loans 
our primary investing activities are the origination of commercial  mortgage and consumer loans and the purchase of investment and mortgage backed securities 
generally  we originate fixed rate  residential mortgage loans with maturities in excess of ten years for sale in the secondary market 
these loans are typically sold soon after the loan closing 
we do not originate and warehouse these fixed rate residential loans for resale in order to speculate on interest rates 
as of december   our residential mortgage loan portfolio consisted of million with fixed rates and million with variable rates 
the allowance for losses on loans is established through a provision for losses on loans based on our evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan activity 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans with respect to which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  level of classified loans and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance for losses on loans 
during we felt it was necessary to increase our provision for loan losses based upon our analysis of our loan portfolio as well as deteriorating market conditions 
even though our levels of non accrual and past due loans declined during  increased levels of loan loss provision were warranted given the economic environment  the uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the recession and the loan losses and resulting charge offs experienced during we feel the external risks within the environment which we operate remain present today and will need to be continuously monitored 
we have identified the stresses in our loan portfolio and are working to reduce the risks of certain loan exposures  including significantly reducing our exposure to construction and land development loans 

table of contents we believe that our capital levels  loan portfolio management and our provision for loan losses position us to deal with the economic uncertainties in this challenging environment 
we will continue to monitor economic events closely  along with the performance of our loan portfolio  and take the necessary steps required to address any issues that may arise 
as of december   loans with aggregate principal balances of million were on non accrual status  or of total loans  compared to a balance of million loans on non accrual status  or of total loans  as of december  the company s non accrual loans decreased during primarily as a result of the collection of outstanding balances on two loan relationships totaling million and from increased charge offs during as part of the company s credit risk management  the company continues to aggressively manage the loan portfolio to identify problem loans and has placed additional emphasis on its commercial real estate and construction relationships 
the ratio of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was at december  and at december  net loan charge offs increased to million for  compared to  for the increase in net loan charge offs during was primarily related to loans that had a specific loss reserve allocation at december  even the though our levels of non accrual loans and loans over days past due declined during  the current economic problems could result in our levels of nonperforming assets staying elevated for a significant period of time 
further deterioration in the local economy or real estate values may create additional problem loans for us 
although the current economic recession has created a very difficult environment for financial institutions  as well as other businesses  the us government  federal reserve and the treasury department have already initiated many programs to try to stimulate the economy 
the economic outlook for depends on whether the stimulus can offset any additional stresses that may arise 
many financial institutions  including us  have experienced an increase in non performing assets during the recent economic period  as even well established business borrowers developed cash flow  profitability and other business related problems 
we believe that the allowance for losses on loans at december   was adequate  however  there can be no assurances that losses will not exceed the estimated amounts 
while we believe that we use the best information available to determine the allowance for losses on loans  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustment to the allowance for losses on loans 
in addition  net earnings could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in establishing the allowance for losses on loans 
liability distribution 
total deposits decreased to million at december  from million at december  borrowings increased million to million at december  from million at december  during we replaced short term public fund certificate of deposits with longer term advances through the fhlb in an effort to extend our liabilities while we thought rates were at a relatively low point in the interest rate cycle 
non interest bearing deposits at december  were million  or of deposits  compared to million  also of deposits  at december  money market and now deposit accounts were of the portfolio and totaled million at december   compared to million  or of deposits  at december  savings accounts increased to million  or of deposits  at december   from million  or of deposits  at december  certificates of deposit decreased to million  or of deposits  at december   from million  or of deposits  at december  certificates of deposit at december  which were scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled million 
historically  maturing deposits have generally remained with the bank and we believe that a significant portion of the deposits maturing in one year or less will remain with us upon maturity 
cash flows 
during the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents decreased by  our operating activities during provided net cash of million  while we used  in investing activities in we purchased million of investment securities during to replace the million that either matured or was sold as well as the million of cash relating to a net decrease in loans 
our financing activities used net cash of million during primarily to purchase treasury stock and pay dividends 
we increased our fhlb borrowings to offset lower deposit balances 

table of contents liquidity 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale 
the level of these assets is dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december  and  the carrying value of these liquid assets totaled million and million  respectively 
during periods in which we are not able to originate a sufficient amount of loans and or periods of high principal prepayments  we increase our liquid assets by investing in short term us government and agency securities or high grade municipal securities 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of our strategy 
excess funds are generally invested in short term investments 
in the event we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  additional funds are available through the use of fhlb advances  a line of credit with the fhlb  other borrowings or through sales of securities 
at december   we had outstanding fhlb advances of million and million of borrowings on our line of credit with the fhlb 
at december   our total borrowing capacity with the fhlb  which is based on collateral pledged  was million 
we also had other borrowings of million at december   which included million of subordinated debentures  million borrowed on a revolving credit agreement and million in repurchase agreements 
as a provider of financial services  we routinely issue financial guarantees in the form of financial and performance standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by us generally to guarantee the payment or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
while these standby letters of credit represent a potential outlay by us  a significant amount of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
we have recourse against the customer for any amount the customer is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit 
the letters of credit are subject to the same credit policies  underwriting standards and approval process as loans made by us 
most of the standby letters of credit are secured  and in the event of nonperformance by the customers  we have the right to the underlying collateral  which could include commercial real estate  physical plant and property  inventory  receivables  cash and marketable securities 
the contract amount of these standby letters of credit  which represents the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by us  was million at december  at december   we had outstanding loan commitments  excluding standby letters of credit  of million 
we anticipate that sufficient funds will be available to meet current loan commitments 
these commitments consist of unfunded lines of credit and commitments to finance real estate loans 
capital 
the federal reserve has established capital requirements for bank holding companies which generally parallel the capital requirements for national banks under occ regulations 
the regulations provide that such standards will generally be applied on a consolidated rather than a bank only basis in the case of a bank holding company with more than million in total consolidated assets 
at december   we continued to maintain a sound leverage capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as shown by the following table  our capital exceeded the minimum capital requirements at december  dollars in thousands actual actual required required amount percent percent amount leverage tier capital total risk based capital 
table of contents at december   landmark national bank continued to maintain a sound leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as shown by the following table  landmark national bank s capital exceeded the minimum capital requirements at december  dollars in thousands actual actual required required amount percent percent amount leverage tier capital total risk based capital banks and bank holding companies are generally expected to operate at or above the minimum capital requirements 
the above ratios are well in excess of regulatory minimums and should allow us to operate without capital adequacy concerns 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of establishes a bank rating system based on the capital levels of banks 
as of december  and  we were rated well capitalized  which is the highest rating available under this capital based rating system 
we have million in trust preferred securities and  in accordance with current capital guidelines  this amount has been included in our tier capital ratios as of december  cash distributions on the securities are payable quarterly  are deductible for income tax purposes and are included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 
on march   the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued a final rule regarding the continued inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies  subject to stricter standards 
as a result of the final rule  the federal reserve will limit the aggregate amount of a bank holding company s cumulative perpetual preferred stock  trust preferred securities and other minority interests to of a company s core capital elements  net of goodwill 
regulations in place at the time we placed our currently outstanding trust preferred securities did not require the deduction of goodwill 
the rule also provides that amounts of qualifying trust preferred securities and certain minority interests in excess of the limit may be included in tier capital but will be limited  together with subordinated debt and limited life preferred stock  to of tier capital 
the final rule provides a five year transition period for bank holding companies to meet these quantitative limitations 
while management does not anticipate that the final rule will have an impact on the company when the five year transition period expires  it is not possible to predict the final impact of the rule on us 
dividends during the year ended december   we paid a quarterly cash dividend of per share to our stockholders 
additionally  we distributed a stock dividend for the eighth consecutive year in december the cash dividends have been adjusted to give effect to the stock dividend 
the payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations

effects on inflation our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation can be found in the increased cost of our operations because our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary and interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our assets and liabilities are principally financial in nature and the resulting net interest income thereon is subject to changes in market interest rates and the mix of various assets and liabilities 
interest rates in the financial markets affect our decision on pricing our assets and liabilities which impacts our net interest income  a significant cash flow source for us 
as a result  a substantial portion of our risk management activities relates to managing interest rate risk 
our asset liability management committee monitors the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet using earnings simulation models and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
we have set policy limits of interest rate risk to be assumed in the normal course of business and monitor such limits through our simulation process 
in the past  we have been successful in meeting the interest rate sensitivity objectives set forth in our policy 
simulation models are prepared to determine the impact on net interest income for the coming twelve months  including using rates at december  and forecasting volumes for the twelve month projection 
this position is then subjected to a shift in interest rates of and basis points rising and basis points falling with an impact to our net interest income on a one year horizon as follows scenario s change in net interest income of net interest income basis point rising basis point rising basis point falling 
table of contents asset liability management interest rate gap analysis is a common  though imperfect  measure of interest rate risk which measures the relative dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which reprice within a specific time period  either through maturity or rate adjustment 
the gap is the difference between the amounts of such assets and liabilities that are subject to such repricing 
a positive gap for a given period means that the amount of interest earning assets maturing or otherwise repricing within that period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or otherwise repricing during that same period 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the cost of its liabilities 
conversely  the cost of funds for an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to decline less quickly than the yield on its assets in a falling interest rate environment 
changes in interest rates generally have the opposite effect on an institution with a negative gap 
following is our static gap schedule 
one to four family and consumer loans included prepayment assumptions  while all other loans assume no prepayments 
the mortgage backed securities included published prepayment assumptions  while all other investments assume no prepayments 
certificates of deposit reflect contractual maturities only 
money market accounts are rate sensitive and accordingly  a higher percentage of the accounts have been included as repricing immediately in the first period 
savings and now accounts are not as rate sensitive as money market accounts and for that reason a significant percentage of the accounts are reflected in the more than to years category 
we have been successful in meeting the interest sensitivity objectives set forth in our policy 
this has been accomplished primarily by managing the assets and liabilities while maintaining our traditional high credit standards
