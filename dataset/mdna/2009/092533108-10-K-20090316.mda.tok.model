overview we were incorporated in delaware on april  and were initially funded on july  our investment objective is to provide a combination of current income and capital appreciation 
we intend to invest primarily in debt and equity securities of private us middle market companies 
we are externally managed and have elected to be regulated as a bdc under the act 
as a bdc  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of private or thinly traded public us companies  cash  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
on july   we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share that raised approximately million in net proceeds 
on july   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share that raised approximately million in net proceeds 
business environment the united states has entered into an economic downturn 
the economic downturn generally and the disruptions in the capital markets in particular have decreased liquidity and the cost of raising capital  where available 
the longer these conditions persist  the greater the probability that these factors could increase our cost and significantly limit our access to debt and equity capital and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
many of the companies in which we have made or will make investments may also be susceptible to the economic downturn  which may affect the ability of one or more of our portfolio companies to repay our loans or engage in a liquidity event  such as a sale  recapitalization or initial public offering 
an economic downturn could also disproportionately impact some of the industries in which we invest  causing us to be more vulnerable to losses in our portfolio 
therefore  the number of our non performing assets is likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods 
the economic downturn has affected the availability of credit generally and may prevent us from replacing or renewing our credit facility on reasonable terms  if at all 
we do not know when market conditions will stabilize  if adverse conditions will intensify or the full extent to which the disruptions will affect us 
if market instability persists or intensifies  we may experience difficulty in raising capital 
challenges in the current market are intensified for us by certain regulatory limitations under the code and the act  as well as contractual restrictions under the agreement governing our credit facility that further constrain our ability to access the capital markets 
to maintain our qualification as a ric  we must satisfy  among other requirements  an annual distribution requirement to pay out at least of our ordinary income and short term capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis 
because we are required to distribute our income in this manner  and because the illiquidity of many of our investments makes it difficult for us to finance new investments through the sale of current investments  our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon external financing 
our external financing sources include the issuance of equity securities  debt securities or other leverage such as borrowings under our credit facility 
our ability to seek external debt financing  to the extent that it is available under current market conditions  is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the act  which require us to have a asset coverage ratio  meaning generally that for every dollar of debt  we must have two dollars of assets 
recent market conditions have also affected the trading price of our common stock and thus our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of equity 
our common stock has traded above and below our net asset value per share 
when our stock is trading below net asset value  our ability to issue equity is constrained by provisions of the act which generally prohibit us from the issuance and sale of our common stock below net asset value per share without stockholder approval 
at our annual meeting of stockholders  our stockholders provided such approval  subject to the determination by our board of directors that such issuance is in our and our stockholders best interests 
the economic downturn may also continue to decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans  as well as the value of our equity investments  which may impact our ability to borrow under our credit facility 
during the year ended december   we experienced an increase in the net unrealized depreciation on our portfolio of investments  which was mainly attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our portfolio 
we may see further decreases in the value of our portfolio  which could limit our ability to borrow under our current credit facility 
additionally  our credit facility 
table of contents contains covenants regarding the maintenance of certain minimum asset coverage and net worth requirements which are affected by the decrease in value of our portfolio 
failure to meet these requirements would result in a default which  if we are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders  could result in the acceleration of our repayment obligations under the credit facility 
we expect that  given these regulatory and contractual constraints in combination with current market conditions  it may be costly or difficult for us to raise additional capital beyond our current credit facility for some time  if at all 
for so long as this is the case  our near term strategy may necessarily become somewhat dependent upon judicious use of our credit facility  retaining capital and building the value of our existing portfolio companies to further the potential of future returns 
we will also  where prudent and possible  consider the sale of lower yielding investments 
with available capital  we intend to continue our strategy of employing our disciplined and selective review process to make portfolio company investments that offer attractive risk adjusted returns for our stockholders 
investments our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity  the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
as a bdc  we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the act unless  at the time the acquisition is made  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets with certain limited exceptions 
qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies 
under the relevant sec rules  the term eligible portfolio company includes all private companies and companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange 
these rules also permit us to include as qualifying assets certain follow on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the definition 
the sec recently adopted an additional rule under the act to further expand the definition of eligible portfolio company to include certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than million 
the new rule became effective on july  revenues we generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt we hold  dividends on our equity interests and capital gains on the sale of warrants and other debt or equity interests that we acquire in portfolio companies 
our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of three to ten years  although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity  and typically bear interest at a fixed or floating rate 
interest on our debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semi annually 
payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment  deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity 
in some cases  our debt instruments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or dividends or pay interest or dividends in kind 
any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees  commitment  origination  structuring or due diligence fees  fees for providing significant managerial assistance and consulting fees 
expenses our primary operating expenses include the payment of a base management fee and  depending on our operating results  an incentive management fee  expenses reimbursable under the management agreement  administration fees and the allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement 
the base management fee and incentive management fee compensate the advisor for work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  closing and monitoring our investments 
our management agreement with the advisor provides that we will reimburse the advisor for costs and expenses incurred by the advisor for office space rental  office equipment and utilities allocable to the advisor under the management agreement  as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the advisor relating to any non investment advisory  administrative or operating services provided by the advisor to us 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including those relating to our organization  calculating our net asset value including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms  expenses incurred by the advisor payable to third parties in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies  interest payable on debt  if any  incurred to finance our investments  
table of contents the costs of future offerings of common shares and other securities  if any  the base management fee and any incentive management fee  dividends and distributions on our preferred shares  if any  and common shares  administration fees payable under the administration agreement  fees payable to third parties relating to  or associated with  making investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  registration fees  listing fees  taxes  independent director fees and expenses  costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the sec  the costs of any reports  proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders  including printing costs  our fidelity bond  directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance  and any other insurance premiums  indemnification payments  direct costs and expenses of administration  including audit and legal costs  and all other expenses reasonably incurred by us or the administrator in connection with administering our business  such as the allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement  including rent and other allocable portions of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs 
during the first year of our operations through july  the advisor agreed to waive its right to receive one half of the base management fee the advisor would otherwise have been entitled to receive from us 
thereafter  the advisor waived one quarter of the amount of the base management fee the advisor would otherwise have been entitled to receive from us 
all of the fee waivers terminated upon completion of the initial public offering of our common stock 
additionally  the management agreement provides that the advisor or its affiliates may be entitled to an incentive fee under certain circumstances 
the determination of the incentive fee will result in the advisor or its affiliates receiving no incentive fee payments if returns to our stockholders do not meet an annualized rate of return and will result in the advisor or its affiliates receiving less than the full amount of the incentive fee percentage until returns to stockholders exceed an approximate annualized rate of return 
annualized rate of return in this context is computed by reference to our net asset value and does not take into account changes in the market price of our common stock 
the determination of the incentive fee is subject to any applicable limitations under the act and the advisers act 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ 
in addition to the discussion below  our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements 
valuation of portfolio investments investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations unless they are deemed not to represent fair value 
we generally obtain market quotations from an independent pricing service or one or more broker dealers or market makers and utilize mid market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value 
however  debt investments with remaining maturities within days are valued at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
because we expect that there will not be a readily available market value for substantially all of the investments in our portfolio  we expect to value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith under the direction of our board of directors using a consistently applied valuation process in accordance 
table of contents with a documented valuation policy that has been reviewed and approved by our board of directors 
due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize 
in addition  changes in the market environment and other events may have differing impacts on the market quotations used to value some of our investments than on the fair values of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available 
market quotations may be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where the advisor believes that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer  a seller or purchaser or the market for a particular security cause current market quotations to not reflect the fair value of the security 
examples of these events could include cases in which material events are announced after the close of the market on which a security is primarily traded  when a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale or in the event of a forced sale by a distressed seller 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of the advisor responsible for the portfolio investment  the investment professionals provide recent portfolio company financial statements and other reporting materials to independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors  such firms conduct independent appraisals each quarter and their preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with senior management of the advisor  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of the independent valuation firms  and the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the advisor  the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee 
those investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued utilizing a market approach  an income approach  or both approaches  as appropriate 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities including a business 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  cash flows or earnings to a single present amount discounted 
the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts 
in following these approaches  the types of factors that we may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include  as relevant and among other factors available current market data  including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables  applicable market yields and multiples  security covenants  call protection provisions  information rights  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  its earnings and discounted cash flows  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public  m a comparables  our principal market as the reporting entity and enterprise values 
upon acquisition  each unquoted investment generally is valued at cost until the end of the second calendar quarter following its acquisition 
as of that date  an independent valuation firm conducts an initial independent appraisal of the investment 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy ie  levels   and  as defined 
additionally  companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the level category which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment  including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities 
we adopted sfas on january  sfas defines fair value as the price that a company would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment 
sfas emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  including assumptions about risk 
inputs may be observable or unobservable 
observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
sfas establishes a hierarchy that classifies these inputs into the three broad levels listed below level valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a company has the ability to access 
level valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
the inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation 
even if observable market data is available  such information may be the result of consensus pricing information or broker quotes which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction 
the non binding nature of consensus pricing and or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification as level information  assuming no additional corroborating evidence 
in addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations  we continue to employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is described above and is consistent with sfas consistent with this valuation policy  we evaluate the source of inputs  including any markets in which our investments are trading  in determining fair value 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp provides an illustrative example of how to determine the fair value of a financial asset in an inactive market 
fsp does not change the fair value measurement principles set forth in sfas since adopting sfas in january  our practices for determining the fair value of our investment portfolio have been  and continue to be  consistent with the guidance provided in fsp determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates 
accordingly  the notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations  and any change in such valuations  on the financial statements 
revenue recognition we record interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  and dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
for loans and securities with pik income  which represents contractual interest or dividends accrued and added to the principal balance and generally due at maturity  we may not accrue pik income if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the pik income is not collectible 
origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees and discounts and premiums on investments purchased are accreted amortized over the life of the respective investment 
unamortized origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees are recorded as unearned income 
upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security  we record any prepayment fees and unamortized loan origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees as interest income 
with respect to the dividends paid to stockholders  income we receive from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income when received and  accordingly  distributed to stockholders 
for financial reporting purposes  such fees are recorded as unearned income and accreted amortized over the life of the respective investment 
for the years ended december   and  these fees totaled   and  respectively 
we anticipate earning additional upfront fees in the future and such fees may cause our taxable income to exceed our gaap income  although the differences are expected to be temporary in nature 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment fees 
realized gains and losses are computed using the specific identification method 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
federal income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code and currently qualify  and intend to continue to qualify each year  as a ric under the code 
in order to qualify as a ric  we are required to distribute annually at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  to our stockholders 
to avoid federal excise taxes  we must distribute annually at least of our income from the current year both ordinary income and net capital gains and any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from the preceding years 
we may  at our discretion  carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a excise tax on this income 
if we choose to do so  all other things being equal  this would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders 
we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income as required 
for the years ended december  and  a provision was recorded for federal excise taxes of  and  respectively 
portfolio and investment activity during the year ended december   we invested approximately million across new and existing portfolio companies 
the new investments consisted primarily of senior loans secured by first liens million  or of the total or second liens million  or  unsecured or subordinated debt securities million  or  senior secured notes million  or and equity securities million  or 
additionally  we received proceeds from sales repayments of investment principal of approximately million during the year ended december  
table of contents at december   our net portfolio of million at fair value consisted of portfolio companies and was invested in senior secured loans  in unsecured or subordinated debt securities  in senior secured notes  in equity investments and in cash equivalents and foreign currency 
our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost was approximately million 
our largest portfolio company investment by value was approximately million and our five largest portfolio company investments by value comprised approximately of our portfolio at december  at december   our net portfolio of billion at fair value consisted of portfolio companies and was invested in senior secured loans  in unsecured or subordinated debt securities  in equity investments  in senior secured notes and approximately in cash equivalents and foreign currency 
our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost was approximately million at december  our largest portfolio company investment by value was approximately million and our five largest portfolio company investments by value comprised approximately of our portfolio at december  the weighted average yield of the debt and income producing equity securities in our portfolio at their current cost basis was at december  and at december  the weighted average yields on our senior secured loans and other debt securities at their current cost basis were and  respectively  at december   versus and  respectively  at december  yields are computed using interest rates and dividend yields as of the balance sheet date and include amortization of loan origination and commitment fees  original issue discount and market premium or discount 
yields exclude common equity investments  preferred equity investments with no stated dividend rate  short term investments  cash  cash equivalents and foreign currency 
at december   of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates  such as libor  euribor  the federal funds rate or the prime rate  and bore interest at fixed rates 
the percentage of our total debt investments that bore floating rate interest based on an interest rate floor was at december  at december   of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates and bore interest at fixed rates 
none of our debt investments bore floating rate interest based on an interest rate floor at december  results of operations results comparisons are for the years ended december   and investment income investment income totaled   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and  of which   and  were attributable to interest and fees on senior secured loans    and  to interest earned on other debt securities    and  to dividends from preferred equity securities and closed end funds    and  to interest earned on short term investments and cash equivalents  and   and  to other income  respectively 
the increase in investment income compared to the prior year reflects the growth of our portfolio as a result of the deployment of debt capital under our credit facility and equity capital from our initial public offering in july total investments at their current cost and borrowings were  and  at december   compared to  and  at december  and  and  at december   respectively 
many of our floating rate debt investments bear interest based on libor 
investment income increased despite lower prevailing levels of libor  as fixed rate instruments as a percentage of our debt investments increased to at december  from and at december  and  respectively 
expenses net expenses including taxes for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively  which consisted of   and  in base management fees net of base management fee waivers of zero   and  zero   and  in incentive management fees owed to the advisor    and  in interest expense and fees related to the credit facility    and  in professional fees    and  in administrative services    and  in advisor expenses    and  in amortization of debt issuance costs    and  in insurance expenses    and  in director fees and   and  in other expenses  respectively 
excise tax expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents the increase in base management fees reflects the growth of the quarterly portfolio values on which the fees are paid in arrears 
no incentive management fees were incurred during due primarily to the increase in unrealized depreciation on investments 
the decrease in interest expense and fees related to the credit facility in is a result of reduced borrowing costs from lower prevailing levels of libor  partially offset by higher average borrowings outstanding 
professional fees and insurance expenses increased as a result of our becoming a publicly traded company in excise taxes increased due to higher than expected amounts of fees from investments and realized gains on forward foreign currency contracts that were not distributed to stockholders in these amounts  currently estimated to be approximately million or per share  will be paid out as dividends to stockholders in net investment income net investment income was   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and which amounts would have been   and  respectively  without base management fee waivers 
the increase was primarily due to portfolio growth and the benefits of leverage from increased borrowings under our credit facility 
net realized gain or loss net realized gain of  for the year ended december  was the result of  in net gains realized from the disposition of investments and  in net gain realized on foreign currency transactions 
for the year ended december   net realized loss was  as a result of  in net gains realized from the disposition of investments offset by  in net losses realized on foreign currency transactions 
for the year ended december  net realized gain was  as a result of  in net gains realized from the disposition of investments partially offset by  in net losses realized on foreign currency transactions 
the net realized gain on foreign currency transactions during primarily reflects the appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro and canadian dollar  which resulted in gains on our forward foreign currency contracts used to hedge investments denominated in such currencies 
net unrealized appreciation or depreciation for the years ended december   and  the change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation was an increase decrease in net unrealized depreciation of   and  respectively 
the increase in net unrealized depreciation for the year ended december  was comprised of an increase in net unrealized depreciation on investments of  and a decrease in net unrealized depreciation on foreign currency translation of  the increase in net unrealized depreciation for the year ended december  was comprised of an increase in net unrealized depreciation on investments of  and a decrease in net unrealized depreciation on foreign currency translation of  the increase in net unrealized appreciation for the year ended december  was comprised of a increase in net unrealized appreciation on investments of  and an increase in net unrealized depreciation on foreign currency translation of 
the increase in net unrealized depreciation for the years ended december  and was primarily a result of a reduction in multiples used to estimate the fair value of our investments and the underperformance of some portfolio companies 
another contributing factor to the increase in unrealized depreciation was market wide increases in interest yields 
market wide movements are not necessarily indicative of any fundamental change in the condition or prospects of our portfolio companies 
net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations the net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations was a decrease of  for the year ended december  and increases of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease during primarily reflects the increase in net unrealized depreciation on investments in excess of net investment income 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated operating cash flows primarily from interest earned and fees received on senior secured loans and other debt securities  as well as from sales of selected portfolio company investments or repayments of principal 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was  our primary uses of cash from operating activities during consisted of a net decrease in net assets from operations of  and purchases of investments net of sales and repayments of  we used  for financing activities during the year ended december   consisting primarily of  of dividend distributions net of reinvestments   of net borrowings under our credit facility and  of treasury stock purchases 
on december   we amended and restated our senior secured  multi currency credit facility to provide us with  in total availability  consisting of  in revolving loan commitments and  in term loan commitments 
total availability and revolving loan commitments reverted to  and  respectively  on april  subject to certain conditions  we have the ability in the future to seek additional commitments from new and existing lenders up to an aggregate amount not to exceed  with respect to revolving loans and  with respect to term loans 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility is generally libor plus basis points with respect to revolving loans and libor plus basis points with respect to term loans 
the term loans mature on december   the termination date of the credit facility  and term loans  once repaid  may not be reborrowed 
at december   we had  drawn and outstanding under the credit facility  with  available to us  subject to compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants  including the maintenance of a minimum stockholders equity  the maintenance of a ratio of not less than of total assets less total liabilities other than indebtedness to total indebtedness  and restrictions on certain payments and issuance of debt 
although we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   continued compliance with such covenants depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
for example  during the year ended december   net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio increased and may continue to increase in the future 
any such further increase could result in our inability to comply with our obligation to restrict the level of indebtedness that we are able to incur in relation to the value of our assets or to maintain a minimum level of stockholders equity 
accordingly  there are no assurances that we will continue to comply with the covenants in our credit facility 
failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under this facility which  if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders thereunder  could result in an acceleration of repayments under the facility and thereby have a material adverse impact on our operations 
on october   our form n shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec 
the shelf registration permits us to offer  from time to time  up to billion of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our common stock  preferred stock or debt securities  and subscription rights 
as a closed end investment company regulated as a bdc under the act  we are prohibited from selling shares of our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the stock  or nav  unless our stockholders approve such a sale and our board of directors makes certain determinations 
on april   our stockholders approved a proposal authorizing us to issue shares of our common stock at a price below the then current nav  with the approval of our board of directors 
the approval expires on the earlier of april  or on the date of our annual meeting of stockholders 
our board of directors has adopted a policy to limit our ability to sell common stock at a price below nav to circumstances in which the price per share of the common stock is equal to or greater of its nav in effect on the date any such sale is priced 
any sale of our common stock at a price below nav would have a dilutive effect on our nav 
certain institutional shareholders beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock at december  the outstanding shares of our common stock owned by such institutions are eligible for immediate sale  subject to compliance with applicable securities laws 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the availability of common stock for sale  could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of common stock should we desire to do so 
the primary use of existing funds is expected to be purchases of investments in portfolio companies  cash distributions to our stockholders  repayment of indebtedness and other general corporate purposes 
at december   we had  in cash equivalents 
in addition  we had  in foreign currency at that date 

table of contents subsequent to december  and through the date of this report  conditions in the public debt and equity markets have continued to be volatile and our net asset value may decline 
while these conditions persist  we expect to meet our liquidity needs through use of the remaining availability under our credit facility  continued cash flows from operations and investment sales 
in the future  we may raise additional equity or debt capital off our shelf registration or may securitize a portion of our investments  among other considerations 
however  we face and expect to continue to face liquidity constraints under current market conditions  and if such conditions worsen substantially  we may be unable to raise capital at all 
equity capital may be difficult to raise because our ability to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share is limited in certain respects 
in addition  the debt capital that will be available  if at all  may be at a higher cost  and on less favorable terms and conditions in the future 
continued inability to raise capital would have a negative effect on our operations 
contractual obligations a summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at december  is as follows payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years after years credit facility payable at december   million remained unused under our credit facility 
we have entered into several contracts under which we have future commitments 
pursuant to an investment management agreement  the advisor manages our day to day operations and provides investment advisory services to us

recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the provisions of sfas were effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we applied sfas on january  and did not elect to apply the fair value option to any other financial assets or liabilities 

table of contents in march  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas is intended to improve financial reporting for derivative instruments by requiring enhanced disclosure that enables investors to understand how and why an entity uses derivatives  how derivatives are accounted for  and how derivative instruments affect an entity s results of operations and financial position 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our financial statements 
at this time  the impact on our financial statements has not been determined 
dividends our quarterly dividends  if any  are determined by our board of directors 
dividends are declared considering our estimate of annual taxable income available for distribution to stockholders and the amount of taxable income carried over from the prior year for distribution in the current year 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level 
dividends declared by the company since july  inception of operations have been as follows dividend amount per share outstanding record date pay date december  january  march  march  june  june  september  september  december  january  march  march  may  may  september  september  december  december  march  march  june  june  september  september  december  december  march  april  tax characteristics of all dividends are reported to stockholders on form after the end of the calendar year 
we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
in order to maintain favorable ric tax treatment  we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
in order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on rics  we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending on october st  and any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
we may  at our discretion  carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a excise tax on this income 
if we choose to do so  all other things being equal  this would increase expenses and reduce the amounts available to be distributed to our stockholders 
we will accrue excise tax on estimated taxable income as required 
in addition  although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 

table of contents we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
for the years ended december   and  dividends reinvested pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan totaled   and  respectively 
under the terms of an amendment to our dividend reinvestment plan adopted on march   dividends may be paid in newly issued or treasury shares of our common stock at a price equal to of the market price on the dividend payment date  which was the case with a previous dividend reinvestment plan that was in effect for our first three quarterly dividends paid to stockholders in this feature of the plan means that  under certain circumstances  we may issue shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  which could cause our stockholders to experience dilution 
reinvestment at such prices resulted in dilution of our net asset value of approximately per share in the aggregate for our first three quarterly dividends of there was no reinvestment of our fourth quarter dividend of as the provisions of our dividend reinvestment plan in effect at that time did not permit reinvestment at a price below estimated net asset value per share 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time 
also  we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a bdc under the act and due to provisions in our existing and future credit facilities 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of favorable ric tax treatment 
in addition  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as payment in kind interest  which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term  or the accrual of original issue or market discount 
since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a ric and may be subject to an excise tax 
with respect to dividends paid to stockholders  income we receive from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income when received and accordingly  distributed to stockholders 
for financial reporting purposes  such fees are recorded as unearned income and accreted amortized over the life of the respective investment 
for the years ended december   and  these fees totaled   and  respectively 
we anticipate earning additional upfront fees in the future and such fees may cause our taxable income to exceed our gaap income  although the differences are expected to be temporary in nature 
on january   the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure  which permits us to make taxable distributions of shares of our common stock in lieu of cash if i any such distribution is declared with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december   and ii each of our stockholders is permitted to elect to receive its entire entitlement under such declaration in either cash or shares of equivalent value subject to a limitation on the amount of cash to be distributed in the aggregate 
we are permitted to establish a limitation on the amount of cash to be distributed of not less than of the aggregate distribution so declared 
if we elect to make a distribution using shares of our common stock and too many of our stockholders elect to receive cash  we would distribute a pro rata amount of cash to each such stockholder electing to receive cash 
to the extent a stockholder electing to receive cash is a participant in our dividend reinvestment plan  only the cash portion of such stockholder s distribution will be eligible for reinvestment 
revenue procedure is effective with respect to distributions declared on or after january  we may elect to make a distribution using shares of our common stock at a time when the market price of our common stock is below net asset value per share  which would result in issuance of shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share and could cause our stockholders to experience dilution 
recent developments in august  our board of directors approved a share repurchase plan under which we may repurchase up to of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
during the year ended december   we purchased a total of  shares of our common stock on the open market for  including brokerage commissions 
we are currently holding the shares we repurchased in treasury 
notice is hereby given in accordance with section c of the act that from time to time the company may purchase shares of its common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices 

table of contents on march   we amended our dividend reinvestment plan  which we refer to as the plan 
under the terms of the amended plan  dividends may be paid in newly issued or treasury shares of our common stock at a price equal to of the market price on the dividend payment date  which was the case with a previous dividend reinvestment plan that was in effect for our first three quarterly dividends paid to stockholders in this feature of the plan means that  under certain circumstances  we may issue shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  which could cause our stockholders to experience dilution 
on march   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share  payable on april  to stockholders of record at the close of business on march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
at december   of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates  such as libor  euribor  the federal funds rate or the prime rate 
the interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months 
at december   the percentage of our total debt investments that bore floating rate interest based on an interest rate floor was 
floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months only if the index exceeds the floor 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates  we have performed the following analysis based on our december  balance sheet and assuming no changes in our investment structure 
net asset value is analyzed using the assumptions that interest rates  as defined by the libor and us treasury yield curves  increase or decrease and that the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
under this analysis  an instantaneous basis point increase in libor and us treasury yields would cause a decline of approximately  or per share  in the value of our net assets at december  and a corresponding basis point decrease in libor and us treasury yields would cause an increase of approximately  or per share  in the value of our net assets on that date 
while hedging activities may help to insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they also may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the years ended december   and  we did not engage in any interest rate hedging activity
