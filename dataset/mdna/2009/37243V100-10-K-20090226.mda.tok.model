table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a specialized laboratory service provider focused on delivering personalized and comprehensive diagnostic services to community based hem oncs 
our highly trained group of hempaths utilizes sophisticated diagnostic technologies to provide a differentiated  specialized and integrated assessment of a patient s condition  aiding physicians in making vital decisions concerning the treatment of malignancies of the blood and bone marrow  and other forms of cancer 
we were organized in  and we began offering specialized diagnostic services in the third quarter of our key service offerings include compass and chart 
by ordering our compass service offering  the hem onc authorizes our hempath to determine the appropriate diagnostic tests to be performed  and our hempath then integrates patient history and previous and current test results into a comprehensive diagnostic report 
as part of our chart service offering  the hem onc also receives a detailed assessment of a patient s disease progression over time 
test requisitions for more than half of the patient samples we processed for the years ended december   and  included our compass or chart service offerings 
we estimate that the us bone marrow testing market alone represents at least a billion opportunity annually and that our current market share for bone marrow procedures is approximately 
our objective is to continue to increase our market share  revenues and profitability at a rate significantly faster than the overall market for blood and bone marrow testing services by continuing to provide and expand our high quality  community hem onc focused specialized diagnostic services 
in furtherance of this objective  our growth strategy has the following key elements expand our organization and infrastructure by increasing our personnel and expanding our sales and other infrastructure to enable us to visit more hem oncs more frequently  expand service offerings to hem oncs by being first to market with new technologies and innovations  leverage our existing infrastructure to increase operating efficiencies by taking advantage of economies of scale and volume discounts  where possible  and pursue additional collaborations and acquisitions to supplement our business 
as a specialized diagnostic service provider  we rely extensively on our high quality of service to promote and maintain our relationships with our community based hem oncs 
we compete primarily based on the quality of testing  reporting and information systems  reliability in patient sample transport  reputation in the medical community and access to our highly qualified hempaths 
our primary competitors include hospital pathologists  esoteric testing laboratories  national reference laboratories and academic laboratories 
our revenues consist primarily of payments or reimbursements received from governmental payors  such as medicare and medicaid  private insurers  including managed care organizations  private payors  such as hospitals  patients  and others for the specialized diagnostic services rendered to our hem onc customers 
our revenues are affected by changes in customer and case volume  payor mix and reimbursement rates 

table of contents additionally  billing for diagnostic services is generally highly complex 
depending on our billing arrangement with each third party payor and applicable law  we are often obligated to bill in the specific manner prescribed by the various payors  each of which may have different billing requirements 
billing for diagnostic services in connection with governmental payor programs is subject to numerous federal and state regulations and other requirements  resulting in additional costs to us 
we report revenues from contracted payors  including medicare  certain insurance companies and certain healthcare institutions  based on the contractual rate  or in the case of medicare  the published fee schedules 
we report revenues from non contracted payors  including certain insurance companies and individuals  based on the amount expected to be collected 
we estimate amounts to be collected based on our historical collection experience 
we believe the key challenges in being able to continue to increase our market share  revenues and profitability are our ability to continue to hire and retain qualified field sales representatives  key management and other personnel  cartesian s ability to hire and retain hempaths  changes in reimbursement levels for our specialized diagnostic services  changes in regulations  payor policies and contracting arrangements with payors  increased competition from competitors attempting to replicate our key service offerings or provide other services that compete with ours  our ability to scale our internal infrastructure  our ability to maintain and strengthen our relationships with our hem onc customers and our ability to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures 
to address these challenges  our management is focused upon expanding our sales organization as the primary driver for our continued growth while maintaining our existing hem onc customer relationships 
our management tracks and measures the general buying patterns of our hem onc customers including cases per month  revenues and cost of revenues per case and turn around time per case and is focused on adding additional sales management and sales representatives in key markets to enhance our penetration in those markets 
our management is also engaged in ensuring cartesian is focused on recruiting  hiring and retaining hempaths to provide the professional services component to support continued growth 
management measures the levels and timeliness of reimbursement from third party payors and reviews on a monthly basis the levels of receivables and average time for collections  as well as cost and margin trends to ensure that investments in our infrastructure and personnel are in line with current sales levels 
we intend to opportunistically pursue additional collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and acquisitions or in licensing of businesses  products or technologies that will enable us to accelerate the implementation of our strategic plan and to increase the number of hem onc customers we serve and or expand the services we provide to them  including by way of investments in other companies  licensing of technology  co development arrangements  collaborations  asset purchases and other similar transactions 
for example  we currently provide specialized testing services and access to our hempaths through collaborations with select pharmaceutical companies 
we expect these collaborations to grow over time  which we believe will improve our financial performance and name recognition and reputation among hem oncs  and potentially provide us with early access to new technologies available for commercialization 
we expect annual revenues from these collaborations to remain at approximately of our total revenues in management has initiated efforts to ensure that office and laboratory space is leased and improved to accommodate the necessary capacity requirements to meet our current and expanding business 
specifically  during the year ended december   we substantially completed tenant improvements within our existing facility having converted warehouse and adjacent internal space to laboratory operations 
additionally  during this same period  we initiated and completed tenant improvements on our newly leased office space  which now houses our administrative functions 
together  these new facility expansions have approximately doubled our overall testing capacity and will increase both cost of revenue and administrative expenses relating to the associated lease expense and depreciation of tenant improvements 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures for these two projects totaled million and million  respectively 
we capitalized tenant improvements funded by landlord lease incentives as property and equipment with an offsetting credit to deferred rent 
as of december   we had capitalized million of these landlord lease incentives  which 
table of contents is included in the million of capital expenditures referenced above 
we currently are not anticipating the need to expand into a new facility located in a geographically different region in  as previously contemplated  but will likely continue our laboratory expansion efforts associated with our california based operations towards the end of our most significant accomplishments during included that we increased revenues by to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  increased the number of cases processed to approximately  for the year ended december   up from approximately  for the year ended december  increased income from operations to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december   despite our increased headcount  facility costs and public company costs 
increased laboratory capacity by approximately doubling our existing laboratory facility in the fourth quarter of through tenant improvements and freeing up additional laboratory space by moving our administrative functions to our new headquarters facility in november increased the number of cartesian hempaths to as of december   up from as of december  increased total headcount by to employees  including cartesian employees and seven part time employees  as of december   up from employees  including three part time employees  as of december  initiated hiring and promotional activities to build mid level management organizational infrastructure in the areas of laboratory operations  sales  marketing  business development  customer service and administration 
consolidated financial statement presentation as of january   the date the psa with cartesian became effective  we determined we had a controlling financial interest in cartesian and began to consolidate the results of cartesian based on the criteria under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 physician practice management entities and certain other entities with contractual management agreements 
all intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation 
seasonality the majority of our testing volume is dependent on patient visits to hem onc s offices and other healthcare providers 
volume of testing generally declines during the year end holiday periods and other major holidays 
in addition  volume of testing tends to decline due to adverse weather conditions  such as excessively hot or cold spells or hurricanes or tornados in certain regions  consequently reducing revenues and cash flows in any affected period  if applicable 
therefore  comparison of the results of successive periods may not accurately reflect trends for future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the policies discussed below  see note in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our specialized diagnostic services are performed based on a written test requisition form and revenues are recognized once the diagnostic services have been performed  the results have been delivered to the ordering physician  the payor has been identified and eligibility and insurance have been verified 
these diagnostic services are billed to various payors  including medicare  commercial insurance companies  other directly billed healthcare institutions such as hospitals  and individuals 
we report revenues from contracted payors  including medicare  certain insurance companies and certain healthcare institutions  based on the contractual rate  or in the case of medicare  the published fee schedules 
we report revenues from non contracted payors  including certain insurance companies and individuals  based on the amount expected to be collected 
the difference between the amount billed and the amount expected to be collected from non contracted payors is recorded as a contractual allowance to arrive at net revenues 
the expected revenues from non contracted payors are based on the historical collection experience of each payor or payor group  as appropriate 
in each reporting period  we review our historical collection experience for non contracted payors and adjust our expected revenues for current and subsequent periods accordingly 
because a substantial portion of our revenues is from third party payors with whom we are not currently contracted  it is likely that we will be required to make positive or negative adjustments to accounting estimates with respect to contractual allowances in the future  which may positively or adversely affect our results of operations 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded positive changes in prior year accounting estimates to reduce contractual allowances  which increased our revenues by million and  respectively 
these favorable changes in accounting estimates related primarily to non contracted payors and resulted from continued improvements to our billing systems and collection processes  as well as increased hiring of personnel and management focused on the collection of accounts receivable for services rendered in prior periods 
during the year ended december   we did not make any significant adjustments to our revenue estimates for prior periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts at the same time revenues are recognized  an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for estimated uncollectible amounts due from our payors 
the process for estimating the collection of receivables associated with our specialized diagnostic services involves significant assumptions and judgments 
specifically  the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted periodically  based upon an evaluation of historical collection experience with specific payors and other relevant factors 
the realization cycle for certain governmental and managed care payors can be lengthy  involving denial  appeal and adjudication processes  and are subject to periodic adjustments that may be significant 
provision for doubtful accounts is charged to general and administrative expense 
accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible and deducted from our allowance for doubtful accounts after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted 
as of december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively  which we reduced by  and  respectively  for write offs  net of recoveries 
prior to writing off an account receivable and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements  we make reasonable and appropriate efforts to collect our accounts receivable  including deductible and coinsurance amounts  in a consistent manner for all payor classes 
we have established collection processes  which may include but are not limited to an automated process for identifying past due accounts  specific follow up 
table of contents activities at scheduled intervals  monitoring of collection activities  and forwarding significant past due accounts to collection agencies 
uncollectible account balances for all payor classes are generally written off after remaining unpaid for a period of months 
occasionally  balances may be determined to be uncollectible prior to the passage of months from the last billing date and are written off at the time of such determination 
our allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for at a rate of approximately  and of revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we recorded positive changes in prior period accounting estimates to reduce the allowance for doubtful accounts  which decreased general and administrative expenses by  this positive change in accounting estimates was the result of continued improvements to our billing systems and collection processes  as well as favorable experience in the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable for services rendered in prior periods 
there were no similar changes in prior period accounting estimates during the years ended december  and the following tables set forth our accounts receivable balances outstanding by aging category for each major payor december  days total commercial payors medicare medicaid self pay other total accounts receivable less allowances for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net december  days total commercial payors medicare medicaid self pay other total accounts receivable less allowances for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net we continually strive to improve our billing and collection systems and processes  which includes increasing the number of trained personnel dedicated to this effort 
to assess our efforts  we continually monitor the dso of our accounts receivable 
our dso averaged days in down from days in and days in as of december  and  our dso was days and days  respectively 
the decrease in average dso was the result of these continued improvements to our billing and collection systems and processes  which we believe will allow us to maintain our current dso levels in income taxes effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation  or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which establishes a single model to address 
table of contents accounting for uncertain tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
we have recognized no significant interest or penalties upon the adoption of fin in and recognized no significant interest or penalties during the year ended december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
we recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
as of december   we no longer maintained a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  as we concluded it meets the more likely than not threshold required under sfas no 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  effective january   we recognized excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we followed the with and without approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
utilization of net operating losses carryforwards  credit carryforwards and certain deductions may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the tax benefits related to future utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards  and other deferred tax assets may be limited or lost if cumulative changes in ownership exceeds within any three year period 
under sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in our ownership have required us to limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that were previously available to offset future taxable income 
we have had three change in ownership events that limit the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
the change in ownership events occurred in march  december and march and resulted in annual net operating loss carryforward limitations of   and million  respectively 
as a result of a net unrealized built in gain from the march change in ownership  our net operating loss carryforward annual limitation of million was increased to million for each of the five years starting after the change in ownership 
these limitations will result in the expiration of unused federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
additionally  these limitations will result in the expiration of federal and state tax credits in the amount of  and  respectively 
the net deferred tax assets were reduced due to the net operating loss and tax credit limitations  with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
additional limitations on the use of these tax attributes could occur in the event of possible disputes arising in examination from various taxing authorities 
currently  we are not under examination by any taxing authorities 
any net operating loss or credit carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income tax benefit expense on the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires compensation expense related to share based transactions  including employee stock options and restricted stock units  or rsus  to be measured and recognized in our consolidated financial statements based on fair value 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
 as amended  and supersedes apb no 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the prospective approach 
under the prospective approach  sfas no 
r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date 
in connection with our initial public offering  or ipo  we implemented an employee stock purchase plan  or espp  on october   which allows qualified employees the opportunity to purchase our common stock at a discount 
generally  the plan consists of a two year offering period with four six month purchase periods and contains a look back provision for determining the purchase price 
we value and account for our espp in accordance with fasb technical bulletin  or ftb  no 
 accounting under statement for certain employee stock purchase plans with a look back option 
the objective of the measurement process for espps with a look back option is to reasonably measure the fair value of the award at the grant date 
the date at which both the company and an employee have a mutual understanding of the terms of the award in exchange for the services already rendered and the employee s total contributions are known becomes the grant date 
at this time  we become contingently obligated to issue equity instruments to the employee 
typically  the grant date is the first day of each six month purchase period 
the terms of our initial purchase period varied slightly  as the period extended from october  to june  and allowed for cash payments in addition to employee payroll deductions 
in june  the employee cash payments were received for this first purchase  thereby establishing the grant date for fair value measurement and the recording of the related stock based compensation expense 
for all remaining stock purchase offerings  employee contributions will be made only through payroll deductions and the grant date for fair value measurement and recording of the related stock based compensation expense will be at the beginning of the offering period 
we record equity instruments issued to non employees  excluding cartesian employees and directors  as expense at their fair value over the related service period as determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods and services  and periodically revalue the equity instruments as they vest 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized   and  respectively  of non employee stock based compensation 
we recognize compensation expense for options and rsus over the vesting period using the straight line method and espp compensation expense per ftb no 
we classify these amounts in the consolidated statements of operations based on the department to which the related employee reports 
the standard vesting period is four years for most awards  but can range from one to four years in certain grants 
we value rsu grants at their intrinsic value 
we use the black scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options and espp shares 
the fair value of employee stock options and espp shares was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions stock options espp years ended december  year ended december  grant date fair value per share assumptions used expected life of awards years risk free interest rate volatility forfeitures dividend yield 
table of contents the continual decline in volatility from through is the result of declines in the actual volatility of our peer group over the estimated life of the options 
these volatility trends are consistent with expectations we had regarding volatility trends as we mature and accumulate history as a public company 
we derived the risk free interest rate assumption from the us treasury s rates for us treasury zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued 
we based the assumed dividend yield on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we calculated the weighted average expected life of options using the simplified method as prescribed by securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 share based payment 
this decision was based on the lack of relevant historical data due to our limited operating experience as a public company 
in addition  due to our limited historical data  the estimated volatility also reflects the application of sab no 
 incorporating the historical volatility of comparable companies within our peer group with publicly available share prices 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of awards that is ultimately expected to vest and thus the gross expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures  if any 
for the espp  we do not utilize a separate forfeiture rate since we adjust espp stock based compensation to actual contributions from the remaining participants at the end of each respective purchase period 
we recognized stock based compensation in the consolidated statements of operations  as follows years ended december  options rsus espp total options rsus total options in thousands cost of revenues sales and marketing general and administrative research and development we expect stock based compensation expense for to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenues based on new and additional stock option and rsu grants while offset by increasing revenues 
fair value the carrying value of certain of our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis  including cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities  are considered to be reasonable estimates of their respective fair values due to their short term nature 
we value financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurement 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
furthermore  the company adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
 which includes an amendment to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  permits entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
we have not specifically identified any financial instruments under sfas no 

table of contents we have evaluated our one remaining ars based on interest rate spreads  credit quality  underlying assets of the issuer and underwriter  likelihood of a successful auction or redemption in the near term and the ability of the issuer to restructure the debt in the current credit environment 
we have assumed that the issuer and or underwriter would be able to satisfy its debt obligation until the credit market would provide a debt restructuring opportunity approximately years and applied a illiquidity discount 
the issuer of the ars continues to make interest payments as scheduled and shows no indications that it will be unable to meet its current obligations 
as a result of the valuation  we have recorded a temporary impairment of approximately million as of december  against the original cost basis of million 
the unrealized loss  net of deferred tax  is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
due to the uncertainty related to the timing of liquidity in the ars market in the near term  the company has classified this ars investment security as a long term asset on the balance sheet with a fair value of million as of december  results of operations the following table presents a comparison of each line item in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december   and years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative research and development impairment and lease exit costs total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss revenues revenues primarily consist of payments or reimbursements received from governmental payors  such as medicare and medicaid  private insurers  including managed care organizations  private payors  such as hospitals  patients and others for the specialized diagnostic services rendered to our hem onc customers 
substantially all of our revenues result from our having been assigned the right to bill and collect for the professional services provided by the hempaths employed by cartesian who work with us in our laboratory facility pursuant to our psa with cartesian 
our revenues from services not performed by cartesian were less than of our total revenues during each of the years ended december   and for the years ended december  and  we derived approximately of our revenues from private insurance  including managed care organizations and other healthcare insurance providers  approximately from medicare and medicaid  and the remaining approximate for each period are from other sources 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenues from private insurance  
table of contents including managed care organizations and other healthcare insurance providers  from medicare and medicaid  and the remaining from other sources 
our revenues are affected by changes in customer and case volume  payor mix  contractual allowances and reimbursement rates 
billing and reimbursement for our specialized diagnostic services in connection with governmental payor programs are subject to numerous federal and state regulations and other billing requirements 
reimbursement under medicare for our specialized diagnostic services is subject to a medicare physician fee schedule  and to a lesser degree  a clinical laboratory fee schedule  both of which are typically updated annually 
these billing and reimbursement arrangements are discussed more fully in the billing and reimbursement section contained in item of this annual report on form k 
years ended december  change revenues in thousands number of cases revenues per case during the years ended december  and  we recorded positive changes in prior period accounting estimates to reduce contractual allowances  which increased our revenues by million and  respectively 
these favorable changes in accounting estimates related primarily to non contracted payors and resulted from continued improvements to our billing systems and collection processes  as well as increased hiring of personnel and management focused on the collection of accounts receivable for services rendered in prior periods 
during the years ended december   we did not make any significant adjustments to our revenue estimates for prior periods 
we expect to continue to have strong billing and collection efforts  but these adjustments could fluctuate both favorably and unfavorably during future periods 
revenues increased to million for the year ended december  up from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively in each case inclusive of the changes in prior period accounting estimates noted above 
the increases of million  or  and million  or  for the years ended december  and  respectively  over each preceding year  were primarily due to case volume increases of and  respectively  and revenue per case increases of  or  and  or  respectively 
these changes were in part due to a net increase in medicare reimbursement rates for our key service offerings and better than expected collections primarily on our non contracted business  as reflected by the favorable changes in accounting estimates that increased our revenues  as discussed above 
service revenues also increased each year as a result of expanding our test offerings 
case volumes  and therefore service revenues  have increased during the year ended december   primarily as a result of the increase in our field sales representatives as of december  similarly  field sales representatives increased for the year ended december  over these increases in our field sales representatives have enabled us to penetrate more accounts over a wider geographic area  increase our customer base and further focus our field sales representatives on in person customer visits 
sales force productivity during the years ended december   and also increased primarily as a result of enhanced recognition in the market  smaller geographies per sales representative  price increases  expanded service offerings and efficiencies realized from a more experienced sales force 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of employee related costs such as salaries  fringe benefits and stock based compensation of our cartesian hempaths  licensed technicians  clinical service coordinators  or csc  and other support personnel  as well as outside laboratory costs  laboratory supplies  logistic costs  depreciation and administrative related costs allocated to cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues generally increases as our case volumes and revenues increase 
we expect that our cost of revenues will continue to increase  as our case 
table of contents volumes and revenues increase  as additional hempaths  technicians and support personnel are hired  as we incur increased outside laboratory costs  and as we spend more on supplies to support these anticipated increases 
in addition  during the year ended december   we substantially completed tenant improvements at our existing facility to convert warehouse and adjacent internal space to additional laboratory operations 
additionally  during this same period  we initiated and completed tenant improvements on our newly leased office space  which now houses our administrative functions allowing us to fully dedicate our primary facility to laboratory testing and support personnel 
together  these new facility expansions have approximately doubled our overall testing capacity and will increase cost of revenues relating to the associated lease expense and depreciation of tenant improvements 
as a result of these expenses associated with our facility expansions  laboratory costs and the hiring of additional hempaths and laboratory personnel  we expect to experience downward pressure on gross margins in years ended december  change cost of revenues in thousands cost of revenues as a of revenues number of cases cost of revenues per case cost of revenues was million for the year ended december   increasing and from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues for the years ended december  and remained relatively consistent at and  respectively  down from for the year ended december  for and  despite increased stock based compensation expense and payroll related expenses associated with the hiring of laboratory personnel and cartesian physicians  these percentages have remained relatively consistent due to higher revenues and the leveraging of our fixed costs 
this  in addition to favorable changes in revenue accounting estimates for prior periods  has resulted in gross margins of and for the years ended december  and  respectively  up from for the year ended december  from to  as a percentage of revenues and on a per case basis  cost of revenues declined as we better leveraged our fixed laboratory infrastructure  more fully utilized our laboratory personnel and lowered the variable material and outsourcing costs through improved pricing with our suppliers 
stock based compensation expense for cost of revenues was million  or of revenue  for the year ended december   compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect stock based compensation expense for to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenues  based on additional awards to existing employees and new hires while offset by increasing revenues 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as salaries  commissions  fringe benefits  stock based compensation and related training and travel costs for our sales personnel in the field and administrative related costs allocated to sales and marketing functions 
as part of our growth strategy  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we hire additional field sales representatives and strengthen our organization with the addition of mid level management and training personnel to more fully develop our sales territories 
we currently expect to grow our field sales representatives to approximately over the next three years 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated hiring and promotional activities to build our sales management organizational structure adding several new area director  regional manager and district manager positions along with additional sales representative hires necessary to backfill for the promotional activities

our primary sources of cash are net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from common stock issuances 
our primary ongoing source of cash is cash receipts on accounts receivable from our revenues 
aside from the growth in revenues  net cash collections of accounts receivable are impacted by the efficiency of our cash collections process as measured by the change in days sales outstanding  or dso 
dso can vary from period to period depending on the payment cycles and the mix of our payors 
our dso averaged days in down from days in and days in as of december  and  our dso was days and days  respectively 
the decrease in average dso was the result of continued improvements to our billing and collection systems and processes  which we believe will allow us to maintain our current dso levels in our primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses and the acquisition of property and equipment 
cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of payments as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses 
acquisitions of property and equipment primarily consist of purchases of facility improvements  laboratory equipment and computer hardware and software

net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  of  pertains to principal payments on long term financing and capital leases of million  offset by proceeds from issuance of notes payable of  liquidity restrictions as of december   we held a single ars with a fair value of million 
the ars had a cost basis of million  which was net of a temporary impairment of million as of december  due to the illiquidity of the investment security 
as such  we had classified the ars as a long term investment security 
ars are collateralized debt instruments with long term contractual maturities that are structured with short term holding periods 
they provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  typically every to days 
the length of each holding period is determined at the original issuance of the ars 
we can sell at each auction at par  assuming there are buyers for the ars at such auction 
in order for the auction to be successful  demand in the marketplace must meet or exceed the supply 
if an auction is unsuccessful  the interest rate on the security resets at a predetermined auction failure rate 
an investor can continue to hold the investment security until the next auction date or attempt to sell in the secondary market  usually at a sizable discount 
the ars in our investment securities portfolio consists of debt issued by a municipality that is also underwritten by an insurance agency 
the auction began failing in february when sell orders exceeded buy 
table of contents orders at the auction dates 
as of december   the security is rated a by moody s investors service and aa by standard poor s based on the underwriter s guarantee 
the last auction occurred on september   prior to the bankruptcy of the broker dealer that managed the auction 
a new broker dealer has yet to be identified 
the funds associated with this failed auction will not be accessible until the issuer restructures the debt  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the ars matures in as such  we have recorded a temporary impairment of approximately million as of december  in the meantime  the issuer continues to pay the interest as scheduled and shows no indication that it will be unable to meet its current obligations 
we do not currently need to access these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future 
because we do not need the current liquidity  we will hold the security until the auctions begin occurring  the issuer restructures the debt or to the contractual maturity date 
based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment securities and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate that the temporary illiquidity of this investment will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
as of december   we had total restricted cash of  restricted cash consists of amounts held in a certificate of deposit to collateralize a standby letter of credit per the terms of an operating lease agreement 
the standby letter of credit requirement expires on august   allowing for  annual reductions on june of each year through capital resources we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment securities as of december   combined with our positive cash flows from operations will be adequate to fund our planned growth and operating activities through at least the next months 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the current economy and financial markets  changes in regulations or payor policies  including reimbursement levels from governmental payors and private insurers  or contracting arrangements with payors or changes in other laws  regulations or policies  and the extent to which we expand our operations and increase our market share 
over the next months  we estimate the costs associated with increasing our personnel to be approximately million to million  the costs associated with the expansion of our existing laboratory and administrative facilities and establishing other new laboratory facilities to be approximately million to million  and the costs associated with additional capital expenditures to be approximately million to million 
we may be required to or otherwise may for strategic or other reasons elect to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
we do not know if we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all particularly in light of the difficult current financial environment and weak economic conditions 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  we may not be able to maintain or grow our business at the rate that we currently anticipate and we may not be able to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements  or we may be required to reduce operating expenses  which would significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we do not have any outstanding debt 
we do not anticipate having to obtain any form of debt in the near future

the tax benefits related to future utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards  and other deferred tax assets may be limited or lost if cumulative changes in ownership exceeds within any three year period 
under sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in our ownership have required us to limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that were previously available to offset future taxable income 
we have had three change in ownership events that limit the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
the change in ownership events occurred in march  december and march and resulted in annual net operating loss carryforward limitations of   and million  respectively 
as a result of a net unrealized built in gain from the march change in ownership  our net operating loss carryforward annual limitation of million was increased to million for each of the five years starting after the change in ownership 
these limitations will result in the expiration of unused federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
additionally  these limitations will result in the expiration of federal and state tax credits in the amount of  and  respectively 
the net deferred tax assets were reduced due to the net operating loss and tax credit limitations  with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
additional limitations on the use of these tax attributes could occur in the event of possible disputes arising in examination from various taxing authorities 
currently  we are not under examination by any taxing authorities 
any net operating loss or credit carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income tax benefit expense on the consolidated statements of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk primarily in the area of changes in us interest rates 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
interest rate risk all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated from our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
if a basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in  our interest income would change by approximately  in relation to amounts we would expect to earn assuming short term investment securities balances and types of investment securities are consistent with those as of december
