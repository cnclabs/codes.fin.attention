item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we securely deliver the enterprise network to users  wherever they work or roam  using a combination of solutions 
our adaptive n wi fi networks optimize themselves to ensure that users are always within reach of mission critical information 
by rightsizing expensive wired lans with our high speed n wi fi  users can potentially reduce both capital and operating expenses 
identity based security assigns access policies to users  enforcing those policies whenever and wherever a network is accessed 
our virtual branch networking solutions for branch offices  fixed telecommuters  and satellite facilities ensure uninterrupted remote access to applications 
finally  our multi vendor network management solutions provide a single point of control while managing both legacy and new wireless networks from us and our competitors 
the products we license and sell include the arubaos operating system  optional value added software modules  a centralized and vendor neutral mobility management system  high performance programmable mobility controllers  wired and wireless access points  wireless intrusion detection tools  spectrum analyzers  and endpoint compliance solutions 

table of contents our products have been sold to over  end customers worldwide not including customers of alcatel lucent  our largest channel partner  including some of the largest and most complex global organizations which resulted in year over year revenue growth despite the downturn in the economy 
in fiscal  we added  customers which contributed to year over year revenue growth of despite the economic downturn 
we have now implemented a two tier distribution model in most areas of the world  including the united states  with vads selling our portfolio of products  including a variety of our support services  to a diverse number of vars 
our focus continues to be management of our channel including selection and growth of high prospect partners  activation of our vars and vads through active training and field collaboration  and evolution of our channel programs in consultation with our partners 
our ability to increase our product revenues will depend significantly on continued growth in the market for enterprise mobility and remote networking solutions  continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  our ability to continue to attract new customers  our ability to compete  the willingness of customers to displace wired networks with wireless lans  and our ability to continue to sell into our installed base of existing customers 
our growth in support revenues is dependent upon increasing the number of products under support contracts  which is dependent on both growing our installed base of customers and renewing existing support contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders  product and channel mix  average selling prices  costs of our products and general economic conditions 
our future profitability will also be affected by our ability to effectively implement and generate incremental business from our two tier distribution model  the extent to which we invest in our sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative resources to grow our business  and current economic conditions 
economic conditions worldwide have negatively impacted our business 
while we believe in the long term growth prospects of the wlan market  the deterioration in overall economic conditions and in particular  tightening in the credit markets and reduced spending by both enterprises and consumers have significantly impacted various industries on which we rely for purchasing our products 
this has led to our customers deferring purchases in response to tighter credit  negative financial news and delayed budget approvals 
for example  we have recently experienced softness in the retail vertical market  as our customers in the retail industry continue to struggle with these economic challenges 
while we saw signs of some stabilization and improved visibility in the second half of fiscal relative to the first half of fiscal  the economic turmoil in the united states  the continuing credit crisis that has affected worldwide financial markets  the significant volatility in the stock markets and other current negative macroeconomic indicators  such as the global recession  or uncertainty or further weakening in key vertical or geographic markets  have resulted in reductions in capital expenditures by end user customers for our products  longer sales cycles  the deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased competition 
these factors have created significant and increasing uncertainty for the future as they could continue to negatively impact technology spending for the products and services we offer and materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the revenue growth that we have experienced has been driven primarily by an expansion of our customer base coupled with increased purchases from existing customers 
we believe the growth we have experienced is the result of business enterprises needing to provide secure mobility to their users in a manner that we believe is more cost effective than the traditional approach of using port centric networks 
while we have experienced both longer sales cycles and seasonality  both of which have slowed our revenue growth  we believe that  without the effect of the current economic conditions  our revenues may have increased at a higher rate during fiscal each quarter  our ability to meet our product revenue expectations is dependent upon new orders received  shipped  and recognized in a given quarter  the amount of orders booked but not shipped in the prior quarter that are shipped in the current quarter  and the amount of deferred revenue entering a given quarter 
our ability to meet our forecasted revenue is dependent on our ability to convert our sales pipeline into product revenues from orders received and shipped within the same fiscal quarter 
our product deferred revenue is comprised of revenue associated with product orders that have shipped but where the terms of the agreement contain acceptance terms and conditions or other terms that require that the revenue be deferred until all revenue recognition criteria are met  as 
table of contents well as those customer contracts that we entered into prior to our establishment of vsoe of fair value 
we typically ship products within a reasonable time period after the receipt of an order 
in november  as a result of the macroeconomic downturn  our board of directors approved a plan to reduce our costs and streamline operations through a combination of a reduction in our work force and the closing of certain facilities 
the majority of the reduction in our work force was completed in the second quarter of fiscal and the remaining reduction was completed in the third quarter of fiscal the reduction in our work force resulted in the termination of employees worldwide  or about of our global work force 
expenses associated with the work force reduction  which were comprised primarily of severance and benefits payments as well as professional fees associated with career transition services  totaled million 
additionally  we closed facilities in california and north carolina and incurred facility exit costs of million as a result 
these expenses were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal these cost reduction efforts  when added to our other cost control measures  resulted in a savings of approximately million during the second quarter of fiscal we realized approximately million in additional savings during the second half of fiscal based on all of our cost reduction efforts 
these efforts included a decrease in marketing  travel and entertainment  outside contractor and other discretionary expenses  as well as hiring controls 
in february  we commenced an exchange offer to allow certain of our employees the opportunity to exchange all or a portion of their eligible outstanding stock options for the same number of new options 
the new options had an exercise price of  equal to the closing price per share of our common stock on march  stock options held by eligible employees with exercise prices above this closing price were eligible for the exchange offer 
generally  all employees who hold options  other than our board members  section officers and employees located in china  france  india or the netherlands  were eligible to participate in the program 
the number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding options did not change as a result of the exchange offer 
new options issued as part of the exchange offer are subject to a new vesting schedule in which one third of the shares subject to each new option grant will vest on the one year anniversary of the new grant date with the remaining shares vesting in equal monthly installments over the following two years 
the new options will have a maximum term of seven years following the new grant date 
we will recognize million in incremental stock based compensation expense over the vesting period of the new grants 
we recognized million in incremental stock based compensation expense arising from the new options that were issued as part of the exchange offer 
revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses revenues we derive our revenues from sales of our arubaos operating system  controllers  wired and wireless access points  application software modules  multi vendor management solution software  and professional services and support 
professional services revenues consist of consulting and training services 
consulting services primarily consist of installation support services 
training services are instructor led courses on the use of our products 
support revenues typically consist of software updates  on a when and if available basis  telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 
we provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
we sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through vads  vars  and oems 
we expect revenues from indirect channels to continue to constitute a significant majority of our future revenues 
we sell our products to channel partners and end customers located in the americas  europe  the middle east  africa and asia pacific 
shipments to our channel partners that are located in the united states are classified as us revenue regardless of the location of the end customer 
we continue to expand into international locations and introduce our products in new markets  and we expect international revenues to increase in absolute dollars and remain consistent to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
for more information about our international revenues  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents cost of revenues cost of product revenues consists primarily of manufacturing costs for our products  shipping and logistics costs  and expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations 
we utilize third parties to manufacture our products and perform shipping logistics 
we have outsourced the substantial majority of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain operations 
accordingly  the substantial majority of our cost of revenues consists of payments to flextronics  our contract manufacturer 
flextronics manufactures our products in china and singapore using quality assurance programs and standards that we jointly established 
manufacturing  engineering and documentation controls are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california and bangalore  india 
cost of product revenues also includes amortization expense from our purchased intangible assets 
cost of professional services and support revenues is primarily comprised of the personnel costs  including stock based compensation  of providing technical support  including personnel costs associated with our internal support organization 
in addition  we employ a third party support vendor to complement our internal support resources  the costs of which are included within costs of professional services and support revenues 
gross margin our gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by a variety of factors  including the proportion of our products that are sold through direct versus indirect channels  new product introductions and enhancements both by us and by our competitors  product mix and average selling prices  pressure to discount our products in response to our competitor s discounting practices  demand for our products and services  our ability to attain volume manufacturing pricing from flextronics and our component suppliers  losses associated with excess and obsolete inventory  growth in our headcount and other related costs incurred in our customer support organization  and amortization expense from our purchased intangible assets 
due to higher net effective discounts for products sold through our indirect channel  our overall gross margins for indirect channel sales are typically lower than those associated with direct sales 
we expect product revenues from our indirect channel to continue to constitute a significant majority of our total revenues  which  by itself  negatively impacts our gross margins 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for sales personnel and stock based compensation for all employees 
our headcount increased from employees at july  to employees at july  in november  our board of directors approved a plan to reduce our costs and streamline operations  through a combination of a reduction in work force and closing certain facilities 
as part of this effort we terminated employees worldwide  or about of our global work force 
we completed our reduction in work force in the third quarter of fiscal going forward  we expect to continue to strategically hire employees throughout the company as well as invest in research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and facilities costs 
we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
we are devoting substantial resources to the continued development of additional functionality for existing products and the development of new products 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because we believe it is essential to 
table of contents maintaining our competitive position 
for fiscal  we expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and remain consistent or decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consist of personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs and facilities costs 
marketing programs are intended to generate revenue from new and existing customers and are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to invest strategically in sales and marketing with the intent to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base  expand our domestic and international sales and marketing activities  build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events 
we expect future sales and marketing expenses to continue to be our most significant operating expense 
generally  sales personnel are not immediately productive  and thus  the increase in sales and marketing expenses that we experience as we hire additional sales personnel is not expected to immediately result in increased revenues and reduces our operating margins until such sales personnel become productive and generate revenue 
accordingly  the timing of sales personnel hiring and the rate at which they become productive will affect our future performance 
for fiscal  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and legal organizations  as well as insurance  investor relations  and it infrastructure costs related to our new erp system 
further  our general and administrative expenses include professional services consisting of outside legal  audit  sarbanes oxley and information technology consulting costs 
we expect that we will incur significant additional legal costs related to defending ourselves against claims made by outside parties  such as the claims described below in part i  item of this report 
for fiscal  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and remain consistent or decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal stock based compensation we recognized million  million  and million of stock based compensation for fiscal years   and  respectively 
other income expense  net other income expense  net includes interest income on cash balances  accretion of discount or amortization of premium on short term investments  interest expense  and losses or gains on remeasurement of non us dollar transactions into non us dollars 
cash has historically been invested in money market funds and marketable securities 
during fiscal and  other income expense  net also included adjustments to record our outstanding preferred stock warrants to fair value 
subsequent to our initial public offering ipo in march  we are no longer required to remeasure these warrants to fair value 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory valuation  allowances for doubtful accounts  income taxes  and goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

table of contents revenue recognition and sales returns our revenues are derived primarily from two sources product revenue  including hardware and software products  and related professional services and support revenue  net of estimated sales returns and earned reseller rebates 
support typically includes software updates  on a when and if available basis  telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 
we provide our customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
revenues for support services are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically between one year and five years 
we account for revenues in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related amendments and interpretations sop because our products are integrated with software that is essential to their functionality and because we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to the equipment through support agreements 
typically  our sales involve multiple elements  such as sales of products that include support  training and or consulting services 
when a sale involves multiple elements  we allocate the entire fee from the arrangement to each respective element based on its vsoe of fair value and recognize revenue when each element s revenue recognition criteria are met 
vsoe of fair value for each element is established based on the sales price we charge when the same element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered element of an agreement  when the undelivered element is support  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the support is delivered 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  we had not been able to establish vsoe of fair value in accordance with sop at the outset of our arrangements 
accordingly  prior to the second quarter of  we recognized revenue for the entire transaction ratably over the support period  as the only undelivered element was typically support 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we were able to establish vsoe of fair value at the outset of our arrangements as we established a new support and services pricing policy  with different services and support offerings than were previously sold 
we also began selling support services separately from our arrangements in the form of support renewals 
accordingly  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we began recognizing product revenues upon delivery using the residual method for transactions where all other revenue recognition criteria were met 
as we had not been able to establish vsoe on our prior services and support offerings  all transactions prior to the second quarter of fiscal continue to be recognized ratably over the support period 
we recognize revenue only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
additionally  we recognize revenue from indirect channel partners upon persuasive evidence provided by our channel partners of a sale to an end customer 
if a sale to an end customer has not occurred by the end of the month in which we ship our products to the channel partner  the revenue is deferred and the products that remain in the partner s inventory pending a sale to an end customer are classified on the consolidated balance sheet as deferred costs until the sale to an end customer occurs and the channel partner provides persuasive evidence of the sale 
the amount of inventory held by resellers pending a sale to an end customer was million and million as of july  and  respectively 
the related sale of support services to a reseller occurs when a specific sale to an end customer occurs 
if the sale of support services occurs at the same time as we receive the initial purchase order from the reseller  the support services are included on that purchase order and recognized ratably over the related support period  commencing on the date of delivery to the end customer 
if the sale of support services occurs after we receive the initial purchase order  the support services for the specific product sales are purchased on a subsequent purchase order 
the subsequent purchase order is received at the time the point of sale pos report is provided for all product sales that occurred during the month 
the support services are recognized ratably over the related support period  commencing from the delivery date to each respective end customer 
post contractual support pcs services that we provide to our channel partners differ from pcs that we provide to our end customers in that we are only obligated to provide support services to the channel partner directly  while the channel partner is obligated to provide support services directly to the end customer 
the channel partner is obligated to provide level and level support services to the end customer  including technical support 
table of contents and rma fulfillment  while our obligations are only to provide software upgrades and level technical support in the unusual scenario in which the channel partner is unable to provide the technical support that the end customer requires 
we record estimated sales returns as a reduction to revenues upon shipment based on our contractual obligations and historical returns experience 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that will likely result in a specific customer s request to return purchased equipment  we record a specific sales returns reserve 
stock based compensation we apply the provisions of sfas no 
r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
our share based payment awards include stock options  restricted stock units and awards  and employee stock purchase plan awards 
we calculate the fair value of restricted stock based on the fair market value on the date of grant 
we calculate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plans on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing method 
this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
we determine the amount of stock based compensation expense based on awards that we ultimately expect to vest  reduced for estimated forfeitures 
in addition  compensation expense includes the effects of awards modified  repurchased or cancelled 
goodwill and intangibles we apply sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and perform an annual goodwill impairment test 
for purposes of impairment testing  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the company 
these estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily includes our market capitalization 
we did not recognize impairment charges in any of the periods presented 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from two to seven years 
long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to estimated results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
determination of recoverability of purchased intangible assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
we did not recognize impairment charges in any of the periods presented 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
inventory valuation inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using the standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we record inventory 
table of contents write downs for potentially excess inventory based on forecasted demand  economic trends  technological obsolescence of our products and transition of inventory related to new product releases 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
inventory write downs amounted to million  million  and million fiscal years   and  respectively 
allowances for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  our management considers  among other factors  the aging of the accounts receivable  including trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of each customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and general economic conditions  especially given the recent financial crisis in today s economic environment 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet their financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due from the customer  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at july  and  respectively 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  along with net operating loss carryforwards  if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences  research and credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards are deductible 
to the extent deferred tax assets cannot be recognized under the preceding criteria  a valuation allowance is established 
income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
at july   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  none of which would materially affect our income tax expense if recognized to the extent that we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
based on the available objective evidence  including the fact that we have generated financial statement losses since inception  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  management has applied a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets

the increase in revenues was attributable to the continual and steady growth of the wlan market and the significant growth in our customer base as we added approximately  new customers 
revenue in the education vertical also experienced strong growth during fiscal our product revenues were bolstered by an increase in revenue related to our n access points 
further  product revenues have grown as companies continue to move toward a low cost it infrastructure solution  which we believe is due in part to the recent economic downturn 
the increase in professional services and support revenues is a result of increased product and first year support sales combined with the renewal of support contracts by existing customers 
as our customer base grows over time  we expect the proportion of our revenues represented by support revenues to increase because substantially all of our customers purchase support when they purchase our products 
ratable product and related professional services and support revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the run off in the amortization of deferred revenue associated with those customer contracts that we entered into prior to our establishment of vsoe of fair value 
we expect ratable product and related professional services and support revenues to continue to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
in fiscal  we derived of our total revenues from indirect channels  which consist of vads  vars and oems  compared to in fiscal going forward  we expect to continue to derive a significant majority of our total revenues from indirect channels as we continue to focus on improving the ability of our indirect channel partners to more effectively market and sell our products 
revenues from shipments to locations outside the united states increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in demand for our products as the wlan market expanded internationally  resulting in an increase in our customer base 
we continue to expand into international locations and introduce our products in new markets  and we expect international revenues to increase in absolute dollars compared to fiscal  and remain consistent to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
total revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in product revenue as a result of the continual and steady growth of the wlan market  the growth in our customer base during fiscal and the introduction of our new n access points 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in ratable product and related professional services and support revenue

for fiscal  and  payments to flextronics and flextronics related costs constituted more than of our cost of product revenues 
cost of professional services and support revenues decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal most of the decrease was attributable to the fact that  during fiscal  we recognized the costs associated with several significant professional services transactions for large product installations 
cost of ratable product and related professional services and support revenues decreased during these periods consistent with the decrease in ratable product and related professional services and support revenues 
as we expand internationally  we may incur additional costs to conform our products to comply with local laws or local product specifications 
in addition  as we expand internationally  we plan to continue to hire additional technical support personnel to support our growing international customer base 
gross margins decreased by during fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a large retail deal recognized in the first quarter of fiscal that had a lower gross margin  an increase in amortization expense related to the acquisition of airwave which occurred in late fiscal  and an increase in our inventory reserves due to product transitions 
in fiscal cost of revenues increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the corresponding increase in our revenues 
cost of professional services and support revenues increased during this period primarily as a result of several significant professional services transactions for large installations of our products that we entered into in the first quarter of fiscal amortization expense included in cost of revenues also increased due to the acquisition of airwave 
gross margins improved for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the increase in our revenues  which grew at a higher rate than the associated costs 
for the first three quarters of fiscal  gross margins increased primarily as a result of a favorable change in our product mix as we continued to sell more higher margin products  as well as the high growth rate and percentage of revenue derived from our support business 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold more access points than in prior quarters  which generally contribute a lower gross margin

this development project was intended to add new functionalities necessary to address evolving customer needs and drive market acceptance of the acquired products 
the acquired in process technology was at a stage of development that required further research and development to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability 
because the in process research and development was not yet complete and not yet generating revenue and profits  there was risk that the developments would not be completed and or not competitive with other products using alternative technologies that offer comparable functionalities 
during fiscal  we completed the in process research and development projects  the results of which were consistent with our expectations 
acquisition related severance expenses in connection with the acquisition of airwave  we terminated one of airwave s executives due to redundancy 
as a result  we recorded expenses totaling approximately  for severance and related benefit costs 
restructuring expenses in november  as a result of the macroeconomic downturn  our board of directors approved a plan to reduce our costs and streamline operations through a combination of a reduction in our work force and the closing of certain facilities 
the majority of the reduction in our work force was completed in the second quarter of fiscal while the remaining reduction was completed in the third quarter of fiscal the reduction in our work force resulted in the termination of employees worldwide  or about of our global work force  mainly in the sales and marketing and research and development functions 
expenses associated with the work force reduction  which were comprised primarily of severance and benefits payments as well as professional fees associated with career transition services  totaled million 
additionally  we closed facilities in california and north carolina and incurred facility exit costs of million as a result 
these cost reduction efforts  when added to our other cost control measures  resulted in a savings of approximately million during the second quarter of fiscal we realized approximately million in additional savings during the second half of fiscal based on all of our cost reduction efforts which included a decrease in marketing  travel and entertainment  outside contractor and other discretionary expenses  as well as hiring controls 

table of contents other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income  interest expense  foreign currency exchange gains and losses  and expense for warrants issued in connection with equipment loans 
years ended july  in thousands interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other income expense  net despite the increase in cash and short term investment balances  interest income during fiscal decreased from fiscal primarily due to declining interest rates 
our average yield to maturity rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal other income expense  net decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the one time inclusion of other income of  in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of revaluing our warrants to purchase preferred stock 
interest income increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to the length of time cash was held in interest bearing investments in fiscal compared to fiscal our cash equivalents and short term investments balance as of july  was million compared to million as of july  however  million of the balance as of july  was received as a result of our ipo in march thus the interest earned in fiscal was lower than fiscal because the investments were held for a shorter period of time 
during fiscal  we adjusted the carrying value of our preferred stock warrants to their fair value each period resulting in warrant expense 
subsequent to the ipo and the associated conversion of our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock  the warrants to purchase shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted to warrants to purchase an equivalent number of shares of our common stock  and the warrants were no longer subject to remeasurement 
these fair value adjustments account for the remaining change in other income expense  net 
provision for income taxes since inception  we have incurred operating losses 
however  while we generated book losses  we generated operating income for foreign  federal and state tax purposes resulting in tax provisions during fiscal as of july   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
we also had research and credit carryforwards of million for federal and million for state income tax purposes as of july  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  all federal and state deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire between and utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if we have experienced an ownership change in the past  or if an ownership change occurs in the future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained according to fin as a result of the implementation of fin  we did not record any changes to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior periods  and no corresponding change in accumulated deficit 
additionally  we did not make any reclassifications between current taxes payable and long term taxes payable upon adoption of fin

liquidity and capital resources as of july  in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents short term investments years ended july  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities 
table of contents cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash  sweep funds and money market funds with an original maturity of days or less at the time of the purchase 
short term investments include corporate bonds  us government agency securities  us treasury bills  commercial paper and other money market securities 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million during fiscal from million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of july  to million as of july  most of our sales contracts are denominated in united states dollars including sales contracts with international customers 
as such  the increase in our revenues derived from international customers has not affected our cash flows from operations as these are not affected by movement in exchange rates 
as we fund our international operations  our cash and cash equivalents are affected by changes in exchange rates 
cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by our working capital requirements and the extent to which we increase spending on personnel 
the timing of hiring sales personnel in particular affects cash flows as there is a lag between the hiring of sales personnel and the generation of revenue and cash flows from sales personnel 
our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  purchases of inventory  and rent payments 
cash provided by operating activities increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal due to increases in deferred revenue and other accrued liabilities  as well as an increase in the amount of non cash adjustments relating to stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  and write downs in our inventory 
cash provided by operating activities was offset by a decrease in accounts payable and a larger net loss compared to fiscal during fiscal  operating activities provided million of cash compared to million of cash used in operating activities during fiscal the increase is due to increases in accounts payable  deferred revenue  and other current and non current liabilities  as well as non cash items such as stock based compensation and depreciation 
cash provided by operating activities was offset by our net loss  and increases in accounts receivable  inventory  and non cash items such as interest accretion on our short term investments 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities during fiscal remained consistent with fiscal we used the proceeds from the sale of our short term investments as well as some of the cash generated from our operating activities to reinvest in additional short term investments 
purchases of property and equipment in fiscal were slightly down compared to fiscal due to an effort to control costs 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal largely due to a significant decrease in our net purchases of short term investments 
cash used in investing activities included cash paid for the acquisition of airwave 
we also purchased property and equipment of million related to the continual build out of our infrastructure to support our growth 
cash flows from financing activities cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our equity incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan was lower in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the decline in the stock price and thus  fewer exercises of employee stock options 
cash outflows for the repurchase of our common stock under our stock repurchase program also decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was derived from proceeds from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our equity incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan 
cash flows from financing activities were offset in part by the million repurchase of common stock under our structured repurchase program 

table of contents in march  we completed our ipo which provided us with approximately million in net proceeds 
we also obtained million in net proceeds from the issuance of our redeemable convertible preferred stock during fiscal based on our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments we expect that we will have sufficient resources to fund our operations for the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
although we have no current agreements  commitments  plans  proposals or arrangements  written or otherwise  with respect to any material acquisitions  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
other uses of cash on february   we announced a stock repurchase program for up to million of our common stock 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we purchased  shares under this program for an aggregate purchase price of million 
no purchases were made during the remainder of fiscal as of july   we were authorized to purchase up to an additional million worth of shares under this program until february  such purchases  if any  will be funded from available working capital 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the price of our common stock  general business and market conditions  and other investment considerations 
to the extent that we repurchase shares under this authorization  interest income may decrease as our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decrease 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations  including two leases signed for our sunnyvale  california space in august and september more less than than total year years years years in thousands operating leases non cancellable inventory purchase commitments total contractual obligations we outsource the production of our hardware to third party manufacturing suppliers 
we enter into various inventory related purchase agreements with these suppliers 
generally  under these agreements  of the orders are cancelable by giving notice days prior to the expected shipment date  and of orders are cancelable by giving notice days prior to the expected shipment date 
orders are not cancelable within days prior to the expected shipment date 
as of july   our unrecognized tax benefits were million which were mostly reflected as a reduction to deferred tax assets  offset by a valuation allowance 
as such  there are no material amounts of contractual obligations associated with these unrecognized benefits to be included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements at july  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk most of our sales contracts are denominated in united states dollars  and therefore  our revenue is not subject to significant foreign currency risk 
our operating expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  euro and japanese yen 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts because expenses in foreign currencies have been insignificant to date  and exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million and million at july  and  respectively 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are held for working capital purposes 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
if overall interest rates had fallen by in fiscal  our interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments would have declined approximately million assuming consistent investment levels
