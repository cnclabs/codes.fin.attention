item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview nike designs  develops and markets high quality footwear  apparel  equipment and accessory products worldwide 
we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts  nike owned retail  including stores and e commerce  independent distributors  franchisees and licensees worldwide 
our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear  apparel  equipment and accessories businesses 
our strategy is to achieve long term revenue growth by creating innovative  must have products  building deep personal consumer connections with our brands  and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences 
we strive to convert revenue growth to shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas making our supply chain a competitive advantage  through operational discipline reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin  and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs improving working capital efficiency deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders through execution of this strategy  our long term financial goal is to achieve high single digit revenue growth mid teens earnings per share growth increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows  and consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses 
table of contents since the adoption of this long term strategy in  on an annual compounded basis  nike  inc s revenues and earnings per share have grown and  respectively 
during the same period  our return on invested capital increased from to 
in fiscal  deteriorating macroeconomic conditions caused significant volatility in global financial markets and put significant pressure on discretionary consumer spending worldwide 
nike s fiscal revenues grew to billion  net income decreased to billion  and we delivered diluted earnings per share of  a decrease versus fiscal our fiscal reported results also contain significant non comparable transactions  including after tax charges of million for our restructuring activities  which were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and million for the impairment of goodwill  intangible and other assets of umbro  which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal our fiscal reported results include combined gains from the sale of our starter brand and nike bauer hockey businesses of million  net of tax  and a one time tax benefit of million 
excluding these non comparable items  net income would have increased to billion and diluted earnings per share would have increased to compared to fiscal see reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share excluding non comparable items below 
the increase in our net income excluding non comparable items was higher than our rate of revenue growth in fiscal due primarily to an increase in other income expense  net  which included foreign currency conversion gains of million compared to foreign currency conversion losses of million in fiscal  and the recognition of licensing income of million related to our fiscal sale of the nike bauer hockey business 
excluding non comparable items  our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program in the first half of fiscal our cash flows from operations and return on invested capital both declined as compared to fiscal during fiscal  we took steps we believe prudent and necessary to identify and manage potential exposures and to position ourselves for sustainable  profitable long term growth 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we executed a plan of restructuring the organization to streamline our management structure  enhance consumer focus  drive innovation more quickly to market  and establish a more scalable cost structure 
as a result of these actions  we reduced our global workforce by approximately and incurred pre tax restructuring charges of million  primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance costs 
as part of this restructuring plan  we also initiated a reorganization of the nike brand business into a new operating model consisting of six geographies 
as a result of the reorganization  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  our new organizational structure will consist of the following geographies north america  western europe  central eastern europe  greater china  japan  and emerging markets 
other steps taken in fiscal included reductions in planned selling and administrative expenses  including the implementation of a hiring freeze  reductions in planned spending for travel  meetings and demand creation  as well as tighter inventory purchasing and working capital management 
we also placed increased focus on monitoring the financial health of suppliers and customers and continued to take proactive measures to consolidate production with our strongest  most efficient and innovative manufacturing contractors to ensure we maintain a healthy production base for the present and the future 
these capacity consolidation actions could result in additional costs associated with production and logistics as well as supply chain disruptions in the first half of fiscal year as we transition production between manufacturing contractors  however  we do not believe these potential additional costs will have a material impact on our operating results 
we continue to believe that the company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective  but we are not immune to the current challenging global economic conditions 
these conditions could continue to affect our business in a number of direct and indirect ways  including lower revenue from slowing consumer customer demand for our products  reduced profit margins and or increased costs  changes in interest and currency exchange rates  lack of credit availability and business disruptions due to difficulties experiences by suppliers and customers 
our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by the evolving macroeconomic conditions and our continued actions to respond to these conditions

table of contents in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took necessary steps to streamline our management structure  enhance consumer focus  drive innovation more quickly to market  and establish a more scalable  long term cost structure 
as a result  we incurred a million pre tax restructuring charge primarily consisting of severance costs related to the workforce reduction 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal to reduce the carrying value of umbro s goodwill  indefinite lived trademark and other assets 
the impairment charge is a result of both the deteriorating global consumer markets  particularly in umbro s primary market  the united kingdom  and management s decision to adjust planned investment in the brand 
in addition  the deterioration of the financial markets has reduced both the present value of future cash flows and the market value of comparable businesses 
the tax benefit realized during fiscal relates to steps taken to realize losses generated by several international entities for which we had not previously recognized the offsetting tax benefit because the realization of those benefits had been uncertain 
the necessary steps to realize those tax benefits were taken during fiscal resulting in a one time reduction of the effective tax rate

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased selling and administrative expense by percentage points in fiscal excluding changes in exchange rates  operating overhead increased during fiscal the increase in operating overhead in fiscal was primarily attributable to investments in growth drivers such as nike owned retail in the us  emea and asia pacific regions  infrastructure for emerging markets in the emea and asia pacific regions and non nike brand businesses  which more than offset the steps taken to reduce operating overhead spending including implementation of a hiring freeze and reductions in spending for travel and meetings 
on a constant currency basis  demand creation expense increased during fiscal demand creation spending decreased in the second half of fiscal as a result of actions taken to reduce spending across nearly all demand creation related activities  most notably traditional media and print advertising 
the increase in demand creation the first half of fiscal was primarily attributable to strategic investments in demand creation  including first quarter spending around the beijing summer olympics and the european football championships  and increased investments in athlete and team endorsements across all regions 
in fiscal  we intend to reduce selling and administrative spending while shifting resources to fund initiatives that are critical to the achievement of our long term growth goals 
we expect our selling and administrative expenses to decline in the first half of fiscal compared to the same period in the prior year  reflecting both lower operating overhead and demand creation spending  with the latter driven partially by the comparison to the significant prior year demand creation investment around the beijing summer olympics and european football championships 
future selling and administrative expense may vary from our current expectations due to changes in the rapidly evolving macroeconomic environment and our reaction to those changes 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by basis points  driven primarily by strategic investments in both demand creation and operating overhead 
changes in currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense growth by percentage points 
on a constant currency basis  demand creation expense increased versus the prior year 
the year over year increase was primarily attributable to investments in athlete and sport team endorsers of our products  spending around major sporting events including the european football championships and the beijing summer olympics  key product initiatives such as men s training in the us and retail presentation 
excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates  operating overhead increased versus the prior year 
the increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as nike owned retail  non nike brand businesses  emerging markets and normal wage inflation and performance based compensation 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we executed a plan to restructure the organization to streamline our management structure  enhance consumer focus  drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure 
as a result of these actions  we reduced our global workforce by approximately and incurred pre tax restructuring charges of million  primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance costs 
these charges are included in our corporate category for segment reporting purposes 
goodwill  intangible and other asset impairment in the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million pre tax non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of umbro s goodwill  intangible and other assets 
although umbro s financial 
table of contents performance for fiscal was slightly better than we had originally expected  projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition 
this erosion is a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets  particularly in the united kingdom  and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business 
we measured the fair value of umbro by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies 
we believe the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis  and this combination is indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation 
the fair value of umbro s indefinite lived trademark was estimated using the relief from royalty method  which assumes that the trademark has value to the extent that umbro is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the trademark 
our assessments have resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of million and million related to umbro s goodwill and trademark  respectively  in fiscal in addition to the impairment analysis  we determined an equity investment held by umbro was impaired  and recognized a charge of million related to the impairment of this investment

fiscal compared to fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was  basis points lower than the prior year 
over the last few years  several of our international entities generated losses for which we did not recognize the corresponding tax benefits  as the realization of those benefits was uncertain 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we took steps necessary to realize these benefits  resulting in a one time tax benefit of million 
also reflected in the year over year effective tax rate improvement was a reduction in our on going effective tax rate resulting from our profits earned outside the united states  our effective tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the us statutory rate 
futures orders worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november declined compared to orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal this futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period  which approximate current spot rates 
the net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately percentage points to this reported futures decline versus the same period in the prior year 
excluding this currency impact  lower apparel orders drove most of the decline in overall futures and advance orders 
the reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period 
this is because the mix of orders can shift between advance futures and at once orders and that the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the scheduled noted above 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders  and actual revenues 
moreover  a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders  including at once and close out sales of nike footwear and apparel  wholesale sales of equipment  cole haan  converse  hurley  umbro  nike golf and retail sales across all brands

in fiscal  foreign currency conversion gains losses reported in corporate expense totaled million compared to million in fiscal  which was primarily driven by a net gain from currency hedges in fiscal versus a net hedge loss in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in corporate expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by increased employee compensation expense due to the increase in centralized corporate functions  higher performance based compensation as well as increased investments in demand creation  including other spending around the beijing summer olympics 
in fiscal  foreign currency conversion loss reported in corporate expense totaled million compared to million in fiscal  which was primarily driven by a larger net loss from currency hedges in fiscal versus foreign currency exposures and hedging practices overview as a global company with significant operations outside the us  in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates 
foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions  such as sales  purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in non functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations  financial position and cash flows into us dollars for consolidated reporting 
our primary foreign currency exposures are related to us dollar transactions at wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in the euro  british pound  chinese renminbi and japanese yen 
our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
this also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements  dependent upon hedge horizons 
we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis  to manage those risks that are material to nike  inc on a consolidated basis 
we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio  and by hedging remaining material exposures  where practical  using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options 
the company s hedging policies are designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged 
we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as issued and amended fas 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
transactional exposures we transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary  which subjects us to foreign currency risk 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are inventory purchases most of our inventory purchases around the world are denominated in us dollars 
this generates foreign currency exposures for all subsidiaries with a functional currency other 
table of contents than the us dollar 
a weaker us dollar reduces the inventory cost in the purchasing subsidiary s functional currency whereas a stronger us dollar increases the inventory cost 
non functional currency revenues a portion of our emea region revenues are earned in currencies other than the euro eg british pound  but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the euro as its functional currency  generating foreign currency exposures 
other revenues and costs non functional currency revenues and costs  such as endorsement contracts  intercompany royalties and other payments  generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent 
non functional currency asset and liabilities our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities  primarily receivables and payables  that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency 
these balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  fas  which may create fluctuations in other income expense within our consolidated results of operations 
managing transactional exposures transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program 
we use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows  including non functional currency revenues and expenses 
these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with fas the fair value of these instruments at may  and was million and million in assets and million and million in liabilities  respectively 
the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income oci  a component of shareholders equity  and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings 
the ineffective portion  which was not material for any year presented  is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense  net 
certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of non functional currency assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not designated as hedges under fas in these cases  the change in value of the instruments is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related asset or liability 
the fair value of these instruments at may  and  was million and million in assets and million and million in liabilities  respectively 
the change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings 
the impact of such instruments is included in other income expense  net and aims to offset foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses of the exposures being hedged 
refer to note risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail 
translational exposures substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting 
the translation of foreign subsidiaries non us dollar balance sheets into non us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to oci within shareholders equity 
in preparing our consolidated statements of income  foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars 
in translation  a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings 
the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and pre tax income was a net translation benefit detriment of million and million  respectively  for the twelve months ended may  
table of contents managing translational exposures to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting  certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated available for sale investments 
the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at non us dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under fas we utilize forward contracts and options to partially  or entirely  hedge the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments 
this has the effect of partially offsetting the year over year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold 
hedges of available for sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of instruments used in this manner at may  and was million and million in assets and and million in liabilities  respectively 
the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in oci and reclassified into earnings in other income expense  net in the period during which the hedged available for sale investment is sold and affects earnings 
any ineffective portion  which was not material for any year presented  is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense  net 
for fiscal  we estimate that the combination of foreign currency conversion gains in other income expense  net and the modestly favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses resulted in a year over year increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately million 
refer to note risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail 
net investments in foreign subsidiaries we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings 
during fiscal  we began to hedge certain net investment positions in euro functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments  with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings 
in accordance with fas  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
any ineffective portion  which was not material for any year presented  is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense  net 
to minimize credit risk  we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration 
upon maturity  the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in oci  concurrent with settlement  we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate 
the impact of net investment hedges reflected in oci was a pre tax gain loss of million and million in and  respectively 
cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled million and million in and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow activity cash provided by operations was billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal this decrease was mainly due to an increase in cash used for our working capital as a result of lower accounts payable and a higher accounts receivable balance 
the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to lower purchases of inventory as well as a reduction in overall spending 
the higher accounts receivable balance is a result of a longer collection cycle  reflecting a more challenging retail environment experienced by our customers in the emea and us regions 

table of contents cash used by investing activities was billion during fiscal compared to billion in fiscal the year over year increase was primarily due to a net increase in short term investments purchased in fiscal the increase in net purchases of short term investments in fiscal was partially offset by proceeds from settlement of net investment hedges of million 
during the second half of fiscal  we began to use net investment hedges to mitigate the risk of variability in foreign currency denominated net investments in certain wholly owned international subsidiaries 
cash used in financing activities was billion during fiscal  compared to billion in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchases to preserve liquidity given the current financial market conditions 
in fiscal  we purchased approximately million shares of nike s class b common stock for million 
as of the end of fiscal  we have repurchased million shares for billion under the billion program approved by our board of directors in june in september  our board of directors approved a new billion share repurchase program 
the new program will commence upon completion of our current billion share repurchase program 
we expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow  excess cash  and or debt 
the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements  we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights  coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
currently  we have several such agreements in place 
however  based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss  we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations our significant long term contractual obligations as of may   and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows cash payments due during the year ending may  description of commitment thereafter total in millions operating leases long term debt endorsement contracts product purchase obligations other total the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products 
actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods 
actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods 
in addition to the cash payments  we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use 
it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product 
the amount of 
table of contents product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions  the number of sporting events in which they participate  and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives 
in addition  the costs to design  develop  source  and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 
we generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers 
the amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business  that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms 
in some cases  prices are subject to change throughout the production process 
the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of may  other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
the amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders for non product purchases 
the reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of may  the total liability for uncertain tax positions was million  excluding related interest and penalties  at may  we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur 
we also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of may  please refer to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements note short term borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below 
outstanding as of may  in millions notes payable  due at mutually agreed upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand payable to sojitz america for the purchase of inventories  generally due days after shipment of goods from a foreign port as of may   letters of credit of million were outstanding  generally for the purchase of inventory 
capital resources in december  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under which million in debt securities may be issued 
as of may   no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration 
we may issue debt securities under the shelf registration in fiscal depending on general corporate needs 
as of may   we had no amounts outstanding under our multi year  billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks 
the facility matures in december based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively  the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing london interbank offer rate libor plus 
the facility fee is of the total commitment 
if our long term debt rating were to decline  the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase 
conversely  if our long term debt rating were to improve  the facility fee and interest rate would decrease 
changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility 
under this committed credit facility  we have agreed to various covenants 
these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio 
in the 
table of contents event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility  failed to meet any covenant  and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks  any borrowings would become immediately due and payable 
as of may   we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
liquidity is also provided by our billion commercial paper program 
as of may   million was outstanding under this program at a weighted average interest rate of 
this borrowing was repaid subsequent to may  we may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal depending on general corporate needs 
we currently have short term debt ratings of a and p from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively 
despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets  to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs 
continuing volatility in the capital markets  however  may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets 
notwithstanding these adverse market conditions  we believe that current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations  together with access to external sources of funds as described above  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 
recently adopted accounting standards on december   we adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas  which provides revised guidance for enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for under fas  and how derivative instruments and the related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the adoption of fas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

on june   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas for financial assets and liabilities  which clarifies the meaning of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under fas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the assets or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income when they occur 
the effective date of the provisions of fas for non financial assets and liabilities  except for items recognized at fair value on a recurring basis  was deferred by fasb staff position fas fsp fas and is effective for the fiscal year beginning june  the adoption of fas for financial assets and liabilities did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the adoption of fas for non financial assets and liabilities is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see note fair value measurements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
also effective june   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas  which allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract by contract basis

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fas r  and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
the provisions of fsp fas are effective for the fiscal year beginning june  we do not expect the adoption of fsp fas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect 
table of contents working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  and contingent payments under endorsement contracts 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
revenue recognition we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
in certain countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location 
on the basis of our tests of actual transactions  we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims  and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to 
table of contents cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 
contingent payments under endorsement contracts a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts 
in general  endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract 
however  certain contract elements may be accounted for differently  based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 
some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg  winning a championship 
we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 
some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg  maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year 
these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period 
in these instances  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s athletic performance  increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 
some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products 
we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur 
in certain contracts  we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product  we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 
property  plant and equipment and definite lived assets property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  among others 
if such facts indicate a potential impairment  we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group 
if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable  we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows 
any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas  we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or when events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value 
events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate  operating results  planned investments in the reporting unit  or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  among other factors 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis 
in step two of the analysis  we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 
we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach 
the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future 
our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital  long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit s business  and working capital effects 
the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business 
significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size  growth  profitability  risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 
we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry  and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis 
indefinite lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks 
in measuring the fair value for these intangible assets  we utilize the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them 
this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands  the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 
hedge accounting for derivatives we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions  as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance 
when specific criteria required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted fas  have been met  changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
in most cases  this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their very nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions changes beyond the threshold allowed by fas  we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income expense  net during the quarter in which such changes 
table of contents occur 
once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels  we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 
we use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 
when appropriately designated as a hedge in accordance with fas  the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments 
as the value of our underlying net investments in wholly owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed  the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk 
accordingly  the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness 
in accordance with fas  we consider  on a quarterly basis  the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment 
should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels  any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred 
stock based compensation as of the first quarter of fiscal  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r share based payment fas r 
under the provisions of fas r  the fair value of stock based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility 
expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year  along with other factors 
our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 
in addition  we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore  and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation 
despite this approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  the 
table of contents actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations  or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
conversely  our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
in this case  our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items  to determine the year to date tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
on a quarterly basis  we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  settled audit issues and new audit activity 
changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other income expense  net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses  we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures  we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 
it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures  we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales  product sourcing and funding activities 
our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
this also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons 
we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain 
table of contents anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party and intercompany transactions 
we also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 
when we begin hedging exposures  the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions 
generally  all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve to eighteen months  although at may  we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as months 
the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by one of our european subsidiaries 
when intercompany loans are hedged  it is typically for their expected duration 
hedged transactions are principally denominated in euro  japanese yen and british pound 
see section foreign currency exposures and hedging practices under item for additional detail 
our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates 
our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a mix of commercial paper  bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swaps 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency option contracts  interest rate swaps  intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 
we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only  and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances  and accounts and loans receivable and payable  including those which are hedged by these instruments 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments  derived using the var model  was million and million at may  and may   respectively 
the var increased  despite a reduction in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative instruments  as a result of increased foreign currency volatilities at may  as compared to 
table of contents may  such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps 
intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation 
furthermore  our non functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts  which are included in the var calculation above 
we  therefore  consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position  results from operations and cash flows 
details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of may  expected maturity date year ended may  thereafter total fair value in millions  except interest rates foreign exchange risk japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate interest rate risk japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency long term us dollar debt fixed rate swapped to floating rate principal payments average interest rate long term us dollar debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries 
accordingly  the monthly re measurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary 
in fiscal  we entered into a receive floating  pay fixed interest rate swap related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries 
this interest rate swap was not designated as a hedge instrument under fas accordingly  changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded to consolidated net income each period 
the change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended may   and both the intercompany loan and the related interest rate swap matured during fiscal
