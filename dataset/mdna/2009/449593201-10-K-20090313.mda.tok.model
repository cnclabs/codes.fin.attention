our total global revenue consisted of the following regional results north american sales of million  or of our consolidated revenue  asia pacific sales of million  or of our consolidated revenue  and european sales of million  or of our consolidated revenue 
we have implemented a variety of marketing activities to market our family of products including participation in major trade shows  key distribution catalogs  distribution promotions  reseller and information technology manager advertising  on line advertising and banner ads  direct mail and bundle advertisements with retail and distribution channel partners and cooperative advertising with our retail partners 
in addition  we pursue a public relations program to educate the market regarding our products

targus  which is a private label reseller of accessories for mobile electronic devices  accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  radioshack  a retailer of consumer electronic devices  accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  the loss of any one or more of targus  radioshack or any of our remaining other major customers would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
no customer other than targus or radioshack accounted for greater than of sales for the year ended december  for our distribution and retail customers  we build product and maintain inventory at various third party warehouses that are under our control until these customers place  and we fulfill  purchase orders for this product 
for private label resellers  we build product to the private label resellers orders  who take possession of the inventory upon delivery to a freight forwarder 
for wireless carriers  we retain ownership of inventory until the product sells through to consumers 
as is generally the practice in our industry  a portion of our sales to distributors and retailers is generally under terms that provide for stock balancing return privileges and price protection 
accordingly  we make a provision for estimated sales returns and other allowances related to those sales 
returns  which are netted against our reported revenue  were approximately of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
also  as is generally the practice in our industry  our oem and private label reseller customers only have return rights in the event that our product is defective 
accordingly  we make a provision for estimated defective product warranty claims for these customers 
defective product warranty claims were less than of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
backlog our backlog at february  was approximately million  compared with backlog of approximately million at february  backlog includes orders confirmed with a purchase order for products scheduled to be shipped within days to customers with approved credit status 
because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty  we do not believe that our backlog  as of any particular date  is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period 
research and development our research and development efforts focus primarily on enhancing our current products and developing innovative new products to address a variety of mobile electronic device needs and requirements 
we work with customers  prospective customers and outsource partners to identify and implement new solutions intended to meet the current and future needs of the markets we serve 

table of contents as of december   our research and development group consisted of people who are responsible for hardware and software design and product testing 
mission technology group employed eight research and development personnel at december  electrical design services are provided to us by several of our outsource partners under the supervision of our in house research and development group 
amounts spent on research and development for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
manufacturing and logistics in order to manufacture our products cost effectively  we have implemented a strategy to outsource substantially all of the manufacturing services for our products 
our internal activities are focused on design  low volume manufacturing and quality testing and our outsourced manufacturing providers are focused on high volume manufacturing and logistics 
we currently have relationships for the manufacture of our family of universal power products with various manufacturing entities primarily located in china 
in addition to providing manufacturing services  a number of these companies also provide us with some level of design and development services 
we purchase the principal components of our products from outside vendors 
the terms of supply contracts are negotiated by us or our manufacturing partners with each vendor 
we believe that our present vendors have sufficient capacity to meet our supply requirements and that alternative production sources for most components are generally available without interruption  however  several vendors are sole sourced 
in order to ensure timely delivery of products to customers  from time to time  we issue letters of authorization to our suppliers that authorize them to secure long lead components in advance of purchase orders for products 
further information about commitments and contingencies relating to letters of authorization is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
the majority of our private label products are shipped by our outsource manufacturers to our private label reseller customers or their fulfillment hubs 
we employ the services of an outsource logistics company to efficiently manage the packaging and shipment of our igo branded products to our various retail and distribution channels 
competition the market for our products is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and sensitive to new product introductions or enhancements and marketing efforts by industry participants 
the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our product offerings include corporate and product reputation  innovation with frequent product enhancement  breadth of integrated product line  product design  functionality and features  product quality  performance  ease of use  support and price 
although we believe that our products compete favorably with respect to such factors  there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current or potential competitors  especially those with greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical or other competitive resources 
however  we believe that our innovative products  coupled with our strategic relationships with private label resellers  retailers  resellers  distributors  and wireless carriers provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
our power products primarily compete with products offered by low cost manufacturers of model specific adapters and specialized third party mobile computing accessory companies  including american power conversion  belkin  comarco  lind  and rrc power solutions 
in addition  we compete with the internal design efforts of some of our customers 
proprietary rights we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents  copyrights  trademarks  and trade secret laws 
we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents  copyrights  and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate 
we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements 
as of march   we held approximately 
table of contents patents and patents pending worldwide relating to our power technology 
there can be no assurance  however  that the rights we have obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction 
although we believe the protection afforded by our patents  copyrights  trademarks  and trade secrets has value  the rapidly changing technology in our industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills  technological expertise  and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws 
some of our products are also designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties 
while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products  we believe  based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
moreover  inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 
there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us  or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
employees as of december  we had full time employees  located in the united states  located in asia and located in europe  including employed in operations  in engineering  in sales and marketing and in administration 
we engage temporary employees from time to time to augment our full time employees  generally in operations 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe we have good relationships with our employees

item a 
risk factors this section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our business 
you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form k 
based on the information currently known to us  we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us 
however  the risks and uncertainties that we face are not limited to those described below 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur  these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
these events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities 

table of contents risks related to our business if our revenue is not sufficient to absorb our expenses  we will not be profitable in the future 
we have experienced significant operating losses since inception and  as of december   have an accumulated deficit of million 
we intend to make expenditures on an ongoing basis to support our operations  primarily from cash generated from operations and  if available  from lines of credit  as we develop and introduce new products and expand into new markets 
if we do not achieve revenue growth sufficient to absorb our planned expenses  we will experience additional losses in future periods 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
our future success is dependent on market acceptance of our power products  particularly in light of the divestiture of our connectivity business and our decision to discontinue the production and marketing of our foldable keyboard products 
if acceptance of our power products does not continue to grow  we will not be able to increase or sustain our revenue  and our business will be severely harmed 
if we do not achieve widespread market acceptance of our power products and technology  we may not maintain our existing revenue or achieve anticipated revenue 
for example  we currently derive a material portion of our revenue from the sale of our power adapter products 
these universal power adapters represent a relatively new product category in the mobile electronics industry 
we anticipate that a material portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future will be derived from our family of universal power products and similar power products in this relatively new market category that we are currently developing or plan to develop 
we can give no assurance that this market category will develop sufficiently to cover our expenses and costs or that we will be able to develop similar power products 
moreover  our power products may not achieve widespread market acceptance if we lose  or fail to replace  any significant retail or distribution partners  we fail to expand or protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property  we fail to complete development of these products in a timely manner  we fail to achieve the performance criteria required of these products by our customers  or competitors introduce similar or superior products 
in addition  the retail version of our universal power adapter products includes a feature that allows a single version of these products to be used with almost any mobile electronic device 
if mobile electronic device manufacturers choose to design and manufacture their products in such a way as to limit the use of universal devices with their devices  it could reduce the applicability of a universal power adapter product and limit market acceptance of our power products at the retail level 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations  and if our results are worse than expected  our stock price could fall 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this happens  the market price for our common stock may decline significantly 
the factors that may cause our operating results to fall short of expectations include the timing of our new product and technology introductions and product enhancements relative to our competitors or changes in our or our competitors pricing policies  market acceptance of our products  the size and timing of customer orders  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels  delay or failure to fulfill orders for our products on a timely basis  distribution of or changes in our revenue among private label resellers  distribution partners  and retailers  
table of contents our inability to accurately forecast our contract manufacturing needs  difficulties with new product production implementation or supply chain  our suppliers ability to perform under their contracts with us  product defects and other product quality problems which may result from the development of new products  the degree and rate of growth of the markets in which we compete and the accompanying demand for our products  our ability to expand our internal and external sales forces and build the required infrastructure to meet anticipated growth  and seasonality of sales 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons and short term fluctuations of our financial results to forecast our future long term performance 
we depend on large purchases from a small number of significant customers  and any loss  cancellation or delay in purchases by these customers could cause a shortfall in revenue  excess inventory and inventory holding or obsolescence charges 
we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers 
our two largest customers  targus and radioshack  comprised of our revenue for the year ended december  these customers typically do not have minimum purchase requirements and can stop purchasing our products at any time or with very short notice 
in addition  most customer agreements are short term and non exclusive and provide for purchases on a purchase order basis 
we expect that a small number of customers will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our sales 
if any of our other major customers reduce  delay or cancel orders with us  and we are not able to sell our products to new customers at comparable levels  our revenue could decline significantly and could result in excess inventory and inventory holding or obsolescence charges 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers would negatively impact our result of operations 
the average selling prices of our products may decrease over their sales cycles  especially upon the introduction of new products  which may negatively affect our gross margins 
our products may experience a reduction in the average selling prices over their respective sales cycles 
further  as we introduce new or next generation products  sales prices of previous generation products may decline substantially 
in order to sell products that have a falling average selling price and maintain margins at the same time  we need to continually reduce product and manufacturing costs 
to manage manufacturing costs  we must collaborate with our third party manufacturers to engineer the most cost effective design for our products 
there can be no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to reduce these costs 
in order to do so  we must carefully manage the price paid for components used in our products as well as manage our freight and inventory costs to reduce overall product costs 
if we are unable to reduce the cost of older products as newer products are introduced  our average gross margins may decline 
our success is dependent in part upon our relationships with a limited number of strategic resellers 
we have entered into relationships with a small number of strategic resellers 
our relationships with strategic resellers  particularly our private label partner targus  are critical to our success  and the failure of these resellers to purchase  and successfully market and distribute our products will limit our success and the market acceptance of our universal power adapters 
for example  one or more private label reseller partners could decide to distribute products manufactured by a competitor in addition to our family of power products and or subsequently discontinue its sales of our family of power products 
in the event other resellers discontinue the sale of our power products or are unsuccessful in marketing and distributing our products  our revenue will suffer  which is likely to have a negative impact on the price of our common stock 

table of contents in addition  under the terms of our agreement with targus  our direct access to certain us markets has been limited for the sale of some of the power products we offer for use with high power mobile electronic devices  and the agreement also provides that we may not enter into any more than two broad based  private label distribution agreements 
accordingly  our success will depend in part upon targus ability and willingness to effectively and widely distribute and market our products 
for example  because the targus distribution channel includes large retailers such as best buy  we are limited in our ability to distribute some of our high power products to similar retailers directly 
if targus does not purchase the volume of products that we anticipate  our results of operations will suffer 
the success of our relationship with strategic resellers  such as targus  will also depend in part upon their success in marketing and selling our products outside of the united states 
the international sales by our strategic resellers are subject to a number of risks that could limit sales of our products 
these risks include the impact of possible recessionary environments in foreign economies  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export restriction and availability of export licenses  and tariffs and other trade barriers 
we will need to expand sales through distributors and resellers in order to develop our business and increase revenue 
we rely to a large extent on distributors and resellers for the distribution and sale of our products 
our strategy contemplates the expansion of our distributor and reseller network both domestically and internationally  and an increase in the number of customers purchasing our products through these expanded channels 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract  train  and motivate new distributors and resellers and expand our relationships with current distributors and resellers 
we may not be successful in expanding our distributor and reseller relationships 
we will be required to invest significant additional resources in order to expand these relationships  and the cost of this investment may exceed the margins generated from this investment 
conducting business through indirect sales channels presents a number of risks  including difficulties in replacing any lost or terminated distributors or resellers  existing or new distributors and resellers may not be able to effectively sell our current or future products  potential distributors and resellers deciding not to enter into relationships with us because of our existing relationships with other distributors and resellers with which they compete  our ability to provide proper training and technical support to our distributors and resellers  distributors and resellers electing to place greater emphasis on products offered by our competitors  and the lack of direct control over the business practices  marketing  sales and services offered by distributors and resellers 
as we expand our distribution and reseller channels  we may also need to expand our sales organization and invest substantial resources toward this expansion 
we may experience difficulty recruiting  training  and retaining qualified sales personnel  and any failure to obtain  train  and keep qualified personnel could limit our ability to sell products 
in addition  distributors and resellers of our products often have rights of return  and in the future  these returns from our existing or any new distributors and resellers may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from us and frequently offer products from several different companies  including competitors products  and distributors and resellers may give higher priority to the sale of our competitors products 
a reduction in sales efforts or efficiency 
table of contents by our distributors or resellers could lead to a reduction in our sales and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
adverse us and international economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our revenues  margins and profitability 
the credit markets and economy in general continue to experience a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
these events  together with the current adverse economic conditions facing the broader economy and in particular  the electronics industry  have  and may continue to adversely affect our business as demand our products may decrease 
increased reliance upon distributors and resellers for the sale of our products will subject us to additional risks  and the failure to adequately manage these risks could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
the inability to accurately forecast the timing and volume of orders for sales of products to resellers and distributors during any given quarter could adversely affect operating results for such quarter and  potentially  for future periods 
for example  if we underestimate sales  we will not be able to fill orders on a timely basis  which could cause customer dissatisfaction and loss of future business 
conversely  if we overestimate sales  we will experience increased costs from inventory storage  waste  and obsolescence 
the loss of one or more large reseller and distributor customers would materially harm our business 
while we currently have a limited number of reseller and distributor agreements  none of these customers are obligated to purchase products from us 
consequently  any reseller or distributor could cease doing business with us at any time 
our dependence upon a few resellers and distributors could result in a significant concentration of credit risk  thus a substantial portion of our trade receivables outstanding from time to time may be concentrated among a limited number of customers 
in addition  many of these customers also have or distribute competing products 
if resellers and distributors elect to increase the marketing of competing products or reduce the marketing of our products  our ability to grow our business will be negatively impacted and will impair our revenue 
additional risks associated with our reseller and distributor business include the following the termination of reseller and distributor agreements or reduced or delayed orders  difficulty in predicting sales to reseller and distributors who do not have long term commitments to purchase from us  which requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated demand  lack of visibility of end user customers and revenue recognition and channel inventory issues related to sales by resellers and distributors  resellers and distributors electing to resell  or increase their marketing of  competing products or technologies or reduced marketing of our products  and changes in corporate ownership  financial condition  business direction  or sales compensation related to our products  or product mix by the resellers and distributors 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if we fail to continue to introduce new products and product enhancements that achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis  we will not be able to compete effectively  and we will be unable to increase or maintain our revenue 
the market for our products is highly competitive and in general is characterized by rapid technological advances  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 
if we fail to continue to introduce new products and product enhancements that achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis  we will not be able to 
table of contents compete effectively  and we will be unable to increase or maintain our revenue 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to develop  in a timely manner  new products and services that keep pace with developments in technology and customer requirements  meet potentially new manufacturing requirements and cover potentially higher manufacturing costs of new products  deliver new products and services through appropriate distribution channels  and respond effectively to new product announcements by our competitors by quickly introducing competing products 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  either enhancements to existing products or new products that respond to technological advances and satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer needs 
if we fail to introduce or sell innovative new products  our operating results may suffer 
in addition  if new industry standards emerge that we do not anticipate or adapt to  our products could be rendered obsolete and our business could be materially harmed 
alternatively  any delay in the development of technology upon which our products are based could result in our inability to introduce new products as planned 
the success and marketability of technology and products developed by others is beyond our control 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products in the past  which resulted in lower quarterly revenue than expected 
further  our efforts to develop new and similar products could be delayed due to unanticipated manufacturing requirements and costs 
delays in product development and introduction could result in loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share  negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand  decline in the average selling price of our products and decline in our overall gross margins  and adverse reactions in our sales and distribution channels 
we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs 
we currently rely on cash flow from operations and cash on hand to fund our operating and capital needs 
we may  in the future  expend significant capital to further develop our products  increase awareness of our brand names  expand our sales  operating and management infrastructure  and pursue opportunities to acquire businesses  products or technologies that complement or expand our current capabilities 
we may also use capital more rapidly than currently anticipated 
additionally  we may incur higher operating expenses and generate lower revenue than currently expected  and we may be required to depend on external financing to satisfy our operating and capital needs 
we may be unable to secure financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all  at the time when we need such funding 
if we raise funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced  and the securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock or may be issued at a discount to the market price of our common stock which would result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  we may be subject to debt covenants  such as the debt covenants under a secured credit facility  which could place limitations on our operations including our ability to declare and pay dividends 
our inability to raise additional funds on a timely basis would make it difficult for us to achieve our business objectives and would have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions could have negative consequences  which could harm our business 
we have acquired  and intend to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire businesses  products or technologies that complement or expand our current capabilities 
for example  in we acquired substantially all of the assets of think outside  inc  a developer and marketer of foldable keyboards and other accessories for mobile handheld devices and  in  made the determination to no longer develop and market these keyboard 
table of contents products 
additional acquisitions could require significant capital infusions and could involve many risks including  but not limited to  the following difficulty integrating the acquired company s personnel  products  product roadmaps  technologies  systems  processes  and operations  including product delivery  order management  and information systems  difficulty in conforming the acquired company s financial policies and practices to our policies and practices and in implementing and maintaining adequate internal systems and controls over the financial reporting and information systems of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention and disruption of ongoing business  difficulty in combining product and technology offerings and entering into new markets or geographical areas in which we have no or limited direct experience and where our competitors may have stronger market positions  loss of management  sales  technical  or other key personnel  revenue from the acquired companies not meeting our expectations  and the potential loss of the acquired companies customers  distributors  resellers  suppliers  or other partners  delays or difficulties and the attendant expense in evaluating  coordinating  and combining administrative  manufacturing  sales  research and development and other operations  facilities  and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards  controls and procedures  including financial controls and controls over information systems  difficulty in completing projects associated with acquired in process research and development  incurring amortization expense related to intangible assets and recording goodwill and non amortizable assets that will be subject to impairment testing and possible impairment charges  dilution of existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities  including the assumption of any stock options or other equity awards issued by the acquired company  overpayment for any acquisition or investment or unanticipated costs or liabilities  assumption of liabilities of the acquired company  including any potential intellectual property infringement claims or other litigation  and incurring substantial write offs  restructuring charges  and transactional expenses 
our failure to manage these risks and challenges could materially harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
further  if we do not successfully address these challenges in a timely manner  we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies on which the value of a transaction was based 
future transactions could cause our financial results to differ from expectations of market analysts or investors for any given quarter  which could  in turn  cause a decline in our stock price 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our business and ability to compete could suffer 
our success and ability to compete are dependent upon our internally developed technology and know how 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent protection  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
while we have certain patents and patents pending  there can be no assurance that patents pending or future patent applications will be issued or that  if issued  those patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted thereunder will provide meaningful protection or other commercial advantage to us 
moreover  there can be no assurance that any patent rights will be upheld in the future or that we will be able to preserve any of our other intellectual property rights 
we typically enter into confidentiality  non compete or invention assignment agreements with our key employees  distributors  customers and potential customers  and limit access to  and distribution of  our product design documentation and other proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that our confidentiality agreements  confidentiality procedures  noncompetition agreements or other factors will be adequate to deter 
table of contents misappropriation or independent third party development of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from obtaining or using information that we regard as proprietary 
we have aggressively pursued the protection of our intellectual property rights  including our recently settled patent infringement lawsuit against american power conversion corporation and our ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against comarco  inc and comarco wireless technologies  inc 
in the eastern district of texas 
litigation efforts such as these have been  and will in the future be  necessary to defend our intellectual property rights  both for our power and expansion technology  and will likely result in substantial cost to  and division of efforts by  us 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect or enforce proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition  under current law  certain patent applications filed with the united states patent and trademark office before november  may be maintained in secrecy until a patent is issued 
patent applications filed with the united states patent and trademark office on or after november   as well as patent applications filed in foreign countries  may be published some time after filing but prior to issuance 
the right to a patent in the united states is attributable to the first to invent  not the first to file a patent application 
we cannot be sure that our products or technologies do not infringe patents that may be granted in the future pursuant to pending patent applications or that our products do not infringe any patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
in the event that any relevant claims of third party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable  we could be prevented from selling our products or could be required to obtain licenses from the owners of such patents or be required to redesign our products to avoid infringement 
there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or  if available  would be on terms acceptable to us or that we would be successful in any attempts to redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement 
our failure to obtain these licenses or to redesign our products would have a material adverse effect on our business 
there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technology similar to our existing proprietary rights 
we expect that our products will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future or  if infringement claims are asserted  that such claims will be resolved in our favor 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to protect our trade secrets or other intellectual property rights  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
for example at the beginning of we settled a patent infringement lawsuit with american power conversion corporation 
we incurred significant costs in this lawsuit and many of our executive officers and employees devoted substantial time and effort to this lawsuit 
if we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary or if we lose key personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify  attract and retain highly skilled executive  managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and operations personnel 
competition for personnel in the technology industry is intense  and we compete for personnel against numerous companies  including larger  more established companies with significantly greater financial resources 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in identifying  attracting and retaining personnel 
our success also depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key executives  management  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to identify  attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as timely product introductions 

table of contents we outsource the manufacturing and fulfillment of our products  which limits our control of the manufacturing process and may cause a delay in our ability to fill orders 
most of our products are produced under contract manufacturing arrangements with several manufacturers in china  taiwan and the united states 
our reliance on third party manufacturers exposes us to risks that are not in our control  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
any termination of or significant disruption in our relationship with our manufacturers may prevent us from filling customer orders in a timely manner  as we generally do not maintain large inventories of our products  and will negatively impact our revenue 
our use of contract manufacturers reduces control over product quality and manufacturing yields and costs 
we depend upon our contract manufacturers to deliver products that are free from defects  competitive in cost and in compliance with our specifications and delivery schedules 
moreover  although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty obligations on the part of contract manufacturers  we remain primarily responsible to our customers for warranty obligations 
disruption in supply  a significant increase in the cost of the assembly of our products  failure of a contract manufacturer to remain competitive in price  the failure of a contract manufacturer to comply with any of our procurement needs or the financial failure or bankruptcy of a contract manufacturer could delay or interrupt our ability to manufacture or deliver our products to customers on a timely basis 
in addition  regulatory agencies and legislatures in various countries  including the united states  have undertaken reviews of product safety  and various proposals for additional  more stringent laws and regulations are under consideration 
current or future laws or regulations may become effective in various jurisdictions in which we currently operate and may increase our costs and disrupt our business operations 
we have committed  for example  to manufacture various high power adapter products with sps  subject to our cost  delivery  quality and other requirements 
in addition  sps manufactures our products on a purchase order basis and does not dedicate manufacturing capacity to us 
any disruption in our relationship with sps and or the inability of sps to meet our manufacturing needs for our high power adapter products could harm our business 
in order to replace sps  we would have to identify and qualify an alternative supplier 
this process could take an extended period of time to complete and could significantly impair our ability to fulfill customer orders 
similarly  we may encounter these same issues with respect to other products manufactured for us by tandy radioshack  phihong and others 
we generally provide our third party contract manufacturers with a rolling forecast of demand which they use to determine our material and component requirements 
lead times for ordering materials and components vary significantly and depend on various factors  such as the specific supplier  contract terms and supply and demand for a component at a given time 
some of our components have long lead times 
for example  certain electronic components used in our high power adapter products have lead times that range from six to ten weeks 
if our forecasts are less than our actual requirements  our contract manufacturers may be unable to manufacture products in a timely manner 
if our forecasts are too high  our contract manufacturers will be unable to use the components they have purchased on our behalf  which may require us to purchase the components from them before they are used in the manufacture of our products 
we rely on contract fulfillment providers to warehouse our igo branded finished goods inventory and to ship our igo branded products to our customers 
we do not have long term contracts with our fulfillment providers 
any termination of or significant disruption in our relationship with our fulfillment providers may prevent customer orders from being fulfilled in a timely manner  as it would require that we relocate our finished goods inventory to another warehouse facility and arrange for shipment of products to our customers 
our reliance on sole sources for key components may inhibit our ability to meet customer demand 
the principal components of our products are purchased from outside vendors 
several of these vendors are our sole source of supply 
we do not have long term supply agreements with the manufacturers of these components 
we depend upon our suppliers to deliver components that are free from defects  competitive in functionality and cost and in compliance with our specifications and delivery schedules 
disruption in supply  a significant increase in the cost of one or more components  failure of a supplier to remain competitive in functionality or price  
table of contents the failure of a supplier to comply with any of our procurement needs or the financial failure or bankruptcy of a supplier could delay or interrupt our ability to manufacture or deliver our products to customers on a timely basis 
any termination of or significant disruption in our relationship with our suppliers may prevent us from filling customer orders in a timely manner as we generally do not maintain large inventories of components or products 
in the event that a termination or disruption were to occur  we would have to find and qualify an alternative source 
the time it would take to complete this process would vary based upon the size of the supplier base and the complexity of the component or product 
delays could range from as little as a few days to several months  and  in some cases  a suitable alternative may not be available at all 
we may not be able to adequately manage our anticipated growth  which could impair our efficiency and negatively impact operations 
our success depends on our ability to manage growth effectively 
if we do not effectively manage this growth  we may not be able to operate efficiently or maintain the quality of our products 
either outcome could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
as we continue to develop new products and bring them to market  we will be required to manage multiple projects  including the design and development of products and their transition to high volume manufacturing 
this will place a significant strain on our operational  financial and managerial resources and personnel  our management information systems  and our operational and financial controls 
to effectively manage our growth we must effectively utilize our research and development resources  install and implement adequate controls and management information systems in an effective  efficient and timely manner  increase the managerial skills of our supervisors  maintain and strengthen our relationships with our contract manufacturers and fulfillment providers  and more effectively manage our supply chain 
our inventory management is complex and failure to properly manage inventory growth may result in excess or obsolete inventory  the write down of which may negatively affect our operating results 
our inventory management is complex as we are required to balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory overstock and obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
in addition  the need to carefully manage our inventory is likely to increase as we expect to acquire additional customers who will likely require us to maintain certain minimum levels of inventory on their behalf  as well as provide them with inventory return privileges 
our customers may also increase orders during periods of product shortages  cancel orders if their inventory is too high  or delay orders in anticipation of new products 
they may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end user demand 
if we ultimately determine that we have excess or obsolete inventory  we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory  which in turn could result in reduced operating results 
we have experienced returns of our products  which could in the future harm our reputation and negatively impact our operating results 
in the past  some of our customers have returned products to us because the product did not meet their expectations  specifications or requirements 
these returns were of revenue for each of the years ended december  and it is likely that we will experience some level of returns in the future and  as our business grows  this level may be more difficult to estimate 
a portion of our sales to distributors is generally under terms that provide for certain stock balancing privileges 
under the stock balancing programs  some distributors are permitted to return up to of their prior quarter s purchases  provided that they place a new order for equal or greater dollar value of the amount returned 
we have not historically experienced significant stock balance returns 

table of contents also  returns may adversely affect our relationship with those customers and may harm our reputation 
this could cause us to lose potential customers and business in the future 
we record a reserve for future returns at the time revenue is recognized 
we believe the reserve is adequate given our historical level of returns 
if returns increase  however  our reserve may not be sufficient and operating results could be negatively affected 
we may have design quality and performance issues with our products that may adversely affect our reputation and our operating results 
a number of our products are based on new technology and the designs are complex 
as such  they may contain undetected errors or performance problems  particularly during new or enhanced product launches 
despite product testing prior to introduction  our products have in the past  on occasion  contained errors that were discovered after commercial introduction 
any future defects discovered after shipment of our products could result in loss of sales  delays in market acceptance or product returns and warranty costs 
we attempt to make adequate allowance in our new product release schedule for testing of product performance 
because of the complexity of our products  however  our release of new products may be postponed should test results indicate the need for redesign and retesting  or should we elect to add product enhancements in response to customer feedback 
in addition  third party products  upon which our products are dependent  may contain defects which could reduce or undermine the performance of our products and adversely affect our operating results 
we may incur product liability claims which could be costly and could harm our reputation 
the sale of our products involves risk of product liability claims against us 
we currently maintain product liability insurance  but our product liability insurance coverage is subject to various coverage exclusions and limits and may not be obtainable in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we do not know whether claims against us with respect to our products  if any  would be successfully defended or whether our insurance would be sufficient to cover liabilities resulting from such claims 
any claims successfully brought against us could harm our business 
risks related to our industry economic conditions  political events  war  terrorism  public health issues  natural disasters and other circumstances could have a material adverse affect on our operations and performance 
our operations and performance  including collection of our accounts receivable  depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending  which have recently deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions  including the united states  and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
some of the factors that could influence the levels of consumer spending include volatility in fuel and other energy costs  conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets  labor and healthcare costs  increased unemployment particularly with office workers  access to credit  consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior 
these and other economic factors have had  and could continue to have  a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  war  terrorism  geopolitical uncertainties  public health issues  and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy  and thus could have a strong negative effect on us and our suppliers  logistics providers  manufacturing vendors and customers 
our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters  fire  power shortages  terrorist attacks  and other hostile acts  labor disputes  public health issues  and other events beyond our control 
such events could decrease demand for our products  make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers  and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain 
should major public health issues  including pandemics  arise  we could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions  additional limitations in freight services  governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions  delays in production ramps of new products  and disruptions in the operations of our manufacturing vendors and component suppliers 

table of contents intense competition in the market for mobile electronic devices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
the market for mobile electronic devices in general is intensely competitive  subject to rapid changes and sensitive to new product introductions or enhancements and marketing efforts by industry participants 
we expect to experience significant and increasing levels of competition in the future 
there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current or potential competitors  especially those with greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical or other competitive resources 
in  we settled a patent infringement suit with comarco  one of our competitors in power products  that resulted in a cross license  which does not include the right to sub license  relating to our respective power product technology 
as a result  comarco may be positioned to develop and market power products that are substantially similar to our products 
we currently compete with the internal design efforts of various oems 
these oems have larger technical staffs  more established and larger marketing and sales organizations and significantly greater financial resources than we do 
such competitors may respond more quickly than we do to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  may devote greater resources to the development  sale and promotion of their products better than we do or may develop products that are superior to our products or that achieve greater market acceptance 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to increase sales in our targeted markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to increase our share of our target market and to sell additional products and product enhancements to existing customers 
future competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins or decreased sales 
should the market demand for mobile electronic devices decrease  we may not achieve anticipated revenue 
the demand for the majority of our products and technology is primarily driven by the underlying market demand for mobile electronic devices 
should the growth in demand for mobile electronic devices be inhibited  we may not be able to increase or sustain revenue 
industry growth depends in part on the following factors general micro and macro economic conditions and decreases in demand for mobile electronic devices resulting from recessionary conditions  increased demand by consumers and businesses for mobile electronic devices  and the number and quality of mobile electronic devices in the market 
the market for our products and services depends on economic conditions affecting the broader information technology market 
prolonged weakness in this market is causing customers to reduce their overall information technology budgets or reduce or cancel orders for our products 
in this environment  our customers may experience financial difficulty  cease operations and fail to budget or reduce budgets for the purchase of our products and services 
this  in turn  may lead to longer sales cycles  delays in purchase decisions  payment and collection  and may also result in downward price pressures  causing us to realize lower revenue and operating margins 
in addition  general economic uncertainty and the recent general decline in capital spending in the information technology sector make it difficult to predict changes in the purchasing requirements of our customers and the markets we serve 
we believe that  in light of these events  some businesses have and may continue to curtail or suspend capital spending on information technology 
these factors may cause our revenue and operating margins to decline 
if our products fail to comply with domestic and international government regulations  or if these regulations result in a barrier to our business  our revenue could be negatively impacted 
our products must comply with various domestic and international laws  regulations and standards 
for example  the shipment of our products from the countries in which they are manufactured to other international or domestic locations requires us to obtain export licenses and to comply with possible import restrictions of the countries in which we sell our products 
in the event that we are unable or unwilling to comply with any such laws  
table of contents regulations or standards  we may decide not to conduct business in certain markets 
particularly in international markets  we may experience difficulty in securing required licenses or permits on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  we are generally required to obtain both domestic and foreign regulatory and safety approvals and certifications for our products 
failure to comply with existing or evolving laws or regulations  including export and import restrictions and barriers  or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates could negatively impact our revenue 
risks related to our common stock our common stock price has been volatile  which could result in substantial losses for stockholders 
our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global market 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  limited daily trading volume 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the market for technology companies  in particular  has at various times experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may significantly affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
the trading price of our common stock could be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  changes in expectations of our future performance  changes in estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet such estimates  quarterly fluctuations in our sales and financial results and a variety of risk factors  including the ones described elsewhere in this report 
periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities sometimes result in securities class action litigation  which regardless of the merit of the claims  can be time consuming  costly and divert management s attention 
in addition  if we needed to raise equity funds under adverse conditions  it would be difficult to sell a significant amount of our stock without causing a significant decline in the trading price of our stock 
our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq global market if the closing bid price for our common stock continues to trade below per share 
nasdaq imposes certain standards that a company must satisfy in order to maintain the listing of its securities on the nasdaq global market 
among other things  these standards require that a company s shares have a minimum closing bid price at or above 
however  nasdaq has suspended its enforcement of this requirement and has announced that it will not take any action to delist any security traded on the nasdaq global market that fails to comply with the minimum closing bid price requirement between october  and april  accordingly  for as long as nasdaq s rule suspension remains in effect  nasdaq will not delist our common stock if its closing bid price remains below per share during the rule suspension period 
if the closing bid price of our common stock continues to fail to meet nasdaq s minimum closing bid price requirement at any time on or after april   or such later date to which nasdaq may extend its suspension of this requirement  or if we otherwise fail to meet all other applicable requirements of the nasdaq global market  nasdaq may make a determination to delist our common stock 
any such delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease and could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and or result in the loss of confidence by investors  customers  suppliers and employees 
our stock price may decline if additional shares are sold in the market 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
all of our outstanding shares are currently available for sale in the public market  some of which are subject to volume and other limitations under the securities laws 
future sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we may be required to issue additional shares upon exercise of previously granted options and warrants that are currently outstanding 
as of march   we had i  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options under our long term incentive plans  of which  options were exercisable as of january   ii  shares of common stock issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units under our long term 
table of contents incentive plan and other outstanding awards  and iii  shares were available for future issuance under our existing plans 
we also had warrants outstanding to purchase  shares of common stock 
increased sales of our common stock in the market after exercise of currently outstanding options could exert significant downward pressure on our stock price 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price we deem appropriate 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders have substantial influence over us 
as of january   our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders owning greater than of our outstanding common stock together beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  may be able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
the concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control that may be viewed as beneficial by the other stockholders 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors 
consequently  our present directors  executive officers  principal stockholders and our respective affiliates may be able to control the election of the members of the board of directors 
such a concentration of ownership could have an adverse effect on the price of the common stock  and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a proposed acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors more difficult 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of preferred stock  with rights senior to those of the common stockholders  without common stockholder approval  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  a staggered board of directors  so that no more than two of our four directors are elected each year  and limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders 
our stockholder rights plan may make it more difficult for others to obtain control over us  even if it would be beneficial to our stockholders 
in june  our board of directors adopted a stockholders rights plan 
pursuant to its terms  we have distributed a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock 
these rights cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts 
these provisions could discourage a future takeover attempt which individual stockholders might deem to be in their best interests or in which shareholders would receive a premium for their shares over current prices 
delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions prohibit large stockholders  in particular a stockholder owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination with a corporation  unless this stockholder receives board approval for the transaction  or of the shares of voting stock not owned by the stockholder approve the merger or transaction 
these provisions could discourage a future takeover attempt which individual stockholders might deem to be in their best interests or in which shareholders would receive a premium for their shares over current prices

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in these forward looking statements 
please see the disclosure concerning forward looking statements and risk factors above for a discussion of factors that may affect our future results 
overview increased functionality and the ability to access and manage information remotely are driving the proliferation of mobile electronic devices and applications 
the popularity of these devices is benefiting from reductions in size  weight and cost and improvements in functionality  storage capacity and reliability 
each of these devices needs to be powered and connected when in the home  the office  or on the road  and can be accessorized  representing opportunities for one or more of our products 
we use our proprietary technology to design and develop products that make computers and mobile electronic devices more efficient and cost effective  thus enabling professionals and consumers higher utilization of their mobile devices and the ability to access information more readily 
our products include power products for high power mobile electronic devices  such as portable computers  power products for low power mobile electronic devices  such as mobile phones  pdas  and mp players  and accessory products 
we are organized in three business segments  which consist of the high power group  the low power group and the connectivity group 
in february  we sold substantially all of the assets  which consisted primarily of inventory  of our handheld hardware product line 
the operating results of the handheld hardware product line were historically included in the results of the connectivity group 
in april  we sold substantially all of the remaining assets of our connectivity group 
the operating results of mission technology group  which purchased substantially all of the assets of our expansion and docking product line  are consolidated with our operating results pursuant to fin r and are included in the connectivity group 
sales to private label resellers and oems accounted for approximately of revenue for the year ended december  and approximately of revenue for the year ended december  sales through retailers and distributors accounted for approximately of revenue for the year ended december  and approximately of revenue for the year ended december  the balance of our revenue during these periods was derived from direct sales to end users 
in the future  we expect that we will be dependent upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue  including most notably radioshack and targus 
our strategy is to develop relationships with a broader set of retailers and wireless carriers to expand the market availability of our igo branded products 
we expect that these relationships will allow us to diversify our customer base  add stability and decrease our traditional reliance upon a limited number of private label resellers 
we also expect that these relationships will significantly increase the availability and recognition of our products  particularly among large national and international retailers and wireless carriers 
our continued focus is on proliferating power products that incorporate our tip technology for both high and low power mobile electronic devices and on developing complementary products 
our long term goal is to establish an industry standard for all mobile electronic device power products based on our patented tip technology 
our ability to execute successfully on our near and long term objectives depends largely upon the general market acceptance of our tip technology which allows users to charge multiple devices with a single power product  our ability to protect our proprietary rights to this technology and on general economic conditions 
additionally  we must execute on the customer relationships that we have developed and continue to design  develop  manufacture and market new and innovative technology and products that are embraced by these customers and the overall market in general 
high power group 
our high power group is focused on the development  marketing and sale of power products and accessories for mobile electronic devices with high power requirements  which consist primarily of portable computers 
these devices also allow users to simultaneously charge one or more low power mobile 
table of contents electronic devices with our optional igo dualpower and power splitter accessories 
we sell these products to private label resellers  distributors  resellers and retailers 
we supplied oem specific  high power adapter products to dell through the first quarter of and we supplied lenovo through the first quarter of we have entered into a strategic reseller agreement with targus to market and distribute high power adapter products on a private label basis 
we also sell our igo branded products directly to retailers such as radioshack and through distributors such as ingram micro 
high power group revenue accounted for approximately of revenue for the year ended december  and approximately of revenue for the year ended december  low power group 
in april  we formed the low power group  which is focused on the development  marketing and sales of power products for low power mobile electronic devices  such as mobile phones  smartphones  pdas  mp players and portable gaming consoles 
these products include cigarette lighter adapters  mobile ac adapters  low power universal ac dc adapters  and low power universal battery products 
each of these power devices is designed to incorporate our patented tip technology 
the combination ac dc adapter also allows users to simultaneously charge a second device with our optional igo dualpower or igo power splitter accessories 
we sell these products to distributors  resellers and retailers 
low power product revenue accounted for approximately of revenue for the year ended december  and of revenue for the year ended december  during  the market for foldable keyboards decreased significantly and we made the decision to discontinue the production and marketing of foldable keyboard products and we intend to sell the remaining inventory of these products in the ordinary course of business 
accordingly  revenue from this product line has decreased significantly in we account for our foldable keyboard business as part of our low power group 
sales of these foldable keyboard products represented approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  and of our total revenue for the year ended december  connectivity group 
our connectivity group consists primarily of the operating results of mission technology group 
the connectivity group was historically focused on the development  marketing and sales of connectivity and expansion and docking products 
our early focus was on the development of remote peripheral component interface  or pci  bus technology and products based on proprietary split bridge technology 
we invested heavily in split bridge technology and while we had some success with split bridge in the corporate portable computer market with sales of universal docking stations  it became clear in early that this would not be the substantial opportunity we originally envisioned 
in may  we sold substantially all of our intellectual property relating to split bridge technology which resulted in a gain on the sale of these assets of million 
recent developments in february  we reduced our total headcount by approximately 
as part of the workforce reduction  joan brubacher departed the company and darryl baker  formerly our vice president  controller and chief accounting officer was appointed to vice president  chief financial officer  and treasurer 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold a portfolio of patents and patents pending related to our foldable keyboard product line 
in late  we discontinued the production and marketing of these products and we expect revenue from this product line to continue to decrease in critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debt expense  warranty obligations  sales returns  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the 
table of contents basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipments and transfers of ownership from us or our contract manufacturers to the customers 
allowances for sales returns and credits are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded 
should the actual return or sales credit rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated allowance for sales returns and credits may be required 
our recognition of revenue from product sales to distributors  resellers and retailers  or the retail and distribution channel  is affected by agreements giving certain customers rights to return up to of their prior quarter s purchases  provided that they place a new order for an equal or greater dollar value of the amount returned 
we also have agreements with certain customers that allow them to receive credit for subsequent price reductions  or price protection 
at the time we recognize revenue related to these agreements  we reduce revenue for the gross sales value of estimated future returns  as well as our estimate of future price protection 
we also reduce cost of revenue for the gross product cost of estimated future returns 
we record an allowance for sales returns in the amount of the difference between the gross sales value and the cost of revenue as a reduction of accounts receivable 
we also have agreements with certain customers that provide them with full right of return prior to the ultimate sale to an end user of the product 
accordingly  we have recorded deferred revenue of  and  as of december  and  respectively  which we will recognize as revenue when the product is sold to the end user 
gross sales to the retail and distribution channel accounted for approximately of revenue for the year ended december  and of revenue for the year ended december  for our products  a historical correlation exists between the amount of retail and distribution channel inventory and the amount of returns that actually occur 
the greater the inventory held by our distributors  the more product returns we expect 
for each of our products  we monitor levels of product sales and inventory at our distributors warehouses and at retailers as part of our effort to reach an appropriate accounting estimate for returns 
in estimating returns  we analyze historical returns  current inventory in the retail and distribution channel  current economic trends  changes in consumer demand  introduction of new competing products and acceptance of our products 
in recent years  as a result of a combination of the factors described above  we have reduced our gross sales to reflect our estimated amounts of returns and price protection 
it is also possible that returns could increase rapidly and significantly in the future 
accordingly  estimating product returns requires significant management judgment 
in addition  different return estimates that we reasonably could have used could have had a material impact on our reported sales and thus could have had a material impact on the presentation of the results of operations 
for those reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to product returns and price protection is a critical accounting estimate 
inventory valuation 
inventories consist of finished goods and component parts purchased both partially and fully assembled 
we have all normal risks and rewards of our inventory held by contract manufacturers 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
inventories include material  labor and overhead costs 
labor and overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on a percentage of material costs 
we monitor usage reports to determine if the carrying value of any items should be adjusted due to lack of demand for the items 
we make a downward adjustment to the value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we recorded a downward adjustment of million during the year ended december  during  we recorded additional profit due to better than planned sales of excess inventory that had previously been adjusted to zero value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
historically  we have recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance in an amount equal to our net 
table of contents deferred tax assets 
if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
long lived asset valuation 
under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we test our recorded long lived assets whenever events indicate the recorded intangible assets may be impaired 
our long lived asset impairment approach is based on an undiscounted cash flows approach using assumptions noted above 
we determined that intangible assets related to our foldable keyboard product line  which is included in the low power group segment  with a net value of  were impaired as of december  we also determined that property and equipment related to our foldable keyboard product line  with a net value of  was impaired as of december  we determined no long lived assets were impaired as of december  if we fail to achieve our assumed growth rates or assumed gross margin  we may incur additional charges for impairment in the future 
for these reasons  we believe that the accounting estimates related to long lived assets are critical accounting estimates 
variable interest entities 
financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie to include the vie s assets  liabilities and operating results in its consolidated financial statements 
in general  a vie is a corporation  partnership  limited liability corporation  trust or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either i has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support  ii has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities  or iii has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations 
in april  we completed a sale of the assets of our expansion and docking business to mission technology group  an entity that was formed by a former officer of the company  in exchange for million of notes receivable and a common equity interest 
there was no cash equity contributed to mission technology group at its formation and mission technology group s equity consists solely of its operating profit 
accordingly  we have determined that mission technology group does not have sufficient equity to carry out its principal operating activities without subordinated financial support  and that mission technology group qualifies as a vie under fin r 
we have also determined that our equity interest and our million notes receivable qualify as variable interests under fin r 
furthermore  as mission technology group is obligated to repay the promissory notes it issued to us  we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie  and accordingly  must include the assets  liabilities and operating results of mission technology group in our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the consolidation of variable interest entities to be a critical accounting policy

revenue generally consists of sales of products  net of returns and allowances 
to date  our revenues have come predominantly from power adapters  handheld products  expansion and docking products  and accessories 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of our consolidated revenue for the periods indicated in thousands decrease percentage change year annual amount from prior year from prior year following is a discussion of revenue by business segment 
high power group 
high power group revenue is derived from sales of power products and accessories for mobile electronic devices with high power requirements  which consist primarily of portable computers 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of our high power group revenue for the periods indicated in thousands decrease percentage change year annual amount from prior year from prior year 
table of contents the decrease in high power group revenue was primarily due to the decrease in the sale of high power products to oem accounts 
sales to oems decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due to the loss of business from dell and lenovo 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from sales to targus by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  likewise  revenue from sales to radioshack increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we believe consumer demand for mobile electronic accessories will decrease in the near term as a result of the current economic environment  and thus we expect high power group revenue to slightly decline in compared to the decrease in high power revenue was primarily due to the loss of revenue from sales to dell 
revenue from sales to dell decreased by million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in revenue from sales to lenovo of million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  likewise  the company recorded an increase in revenue from sales to targus of million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  low power group 
low power group revenue is derived from the sales of low power adapter products and foldable keyboard products 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of our low power group revenue for the periods indicated in thousands increase percentage change year annual amount from prior year from prior year the increase in low power group revenue was primarily due to revenue from sales of low power product sales to radioshack  which increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  revenue from sales of low power products to wireless carrier distribution increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  revenue from sales of low power products in the airport channel increased by  or to million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  these increases were offset by a decrease in revenue from the sales of foldable keyboards of million  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  due to the company discontinuing this line of products during we expect low power group revenue from sales into existing sales channels to be negatively impacted in by a reduction in consumer demand for mobile electronic accessories resulting from the current economic environment 
nevertheless  we expect low power group revenue to slightly increase in as a result of anticipated further gains in market penetration into mobile wireless carriers  distributors and retailers largely through our own sales efforts 
the increase in low power group revenue was primarily due to continued sales growth of our family of low power products as a result of what we believe to be increased consumer awareness and further market penetration of our products and technology 
the increase was primarily attributable to revenue from sales of low power product sales to radioshack  which increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  revenue from sales of low power products to other customers increased by approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue from sales of foldable keyboard products  a product line that was acquired in may  increased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  connectivity group 
connectivity group revenue was derived from sales of expansion and docking products and handheld products 
in the first quarter of  we divested the handheld hardware product line 
in the second 
table of contents quarter of  we sold the assets of the expansion and docking product line to mission technology group 
we consolidate the operating results of mission technology group in accordance with fin r and those results are included in the connectivity group 
see acquisitions and dispositions for more information 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of our connectivity group revenue for the periods indicated in thousands increase decrease percentage change year annual amount from prior year from prior year connectivity revenue for the year ended december  was consistent with revenue for the year ended december  we expect to continue to consolidate the operating results of mission technology group into the connectivity group until such time as we are no longer considered the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity 
furthermore  we anticipate connectivity group revenue will be consistent with revenue 
the decrease in connectivity group revenue was due primarily to the divestiture of handheld hardware product line in the first quarter of as a result of this divestiture  revenue from sales of handheld hardware products declined by million  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decline was partially offset by revenue from sales of expansion and docking products  which increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenue  gross profit and gross margin 
cost of revenue generally consists of costs associated with components  outsourced manufacturing and in house labor associated with assembly  testing  packaging  shipping and quality assurance  depreciation of equipment and indirect manufacturing costs 
gross profit is the difference between revenue and cost of revenue

table of contents the decrease in cost of revenue was due primarily to the volume decrease in revenue as compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded an adjustment to cost of revenue in the amount of million  compared to an adjustment of million during the year ended december   as a result of reduced marketability of certain of our inventory 
as a result of these factors  cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   resulting in a corresponding decrease to gross margin 
sales and marketing

specifically  during the year ended december   we reduced our engineering staff from employees at december  to employees at december  as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  
table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses of our finance  human resources  information systems  corporate development and other administrative personnel  as well as facilities  legal and other professional fees  depreciation and amortization and related expenses 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated in thousands increase decrease percentage change year annual amount from prior year from prior year the decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from decreases to personnel related expenses  outside professional fees and non cash equity compensation expense 
specifically  personnel related expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  included in this decrease is  in separation expense incurred in connection with the retirement of our former chief executive officer in outside professional fees  including legal and accounting  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  non cash equity compensation decreased by  to million  or  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due primarily to the organizational restructuring that occurred in july and the resignation of a board member that occurred in may general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from million in separation and non cash equity compensation charges in connection with the retirement of our former chief executive officer  and a  charge related to a reduction in workforce 
these increases were offset  in part  by decreases in outside legal expenses of approximately  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  asset impairment 
asset impairment expense consists of expenses associated with impairment write downs of goodwill  amortizable intangible assets  and property and equipment 
at december   we determined that million of goodwill associated with the high power group and  of goodwill associated with the low power group was fully impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during the year ended december  also  during the fourth quarter of  as a result of our decision to discontinue production and marketing of foldable keyboard products  we determined a triggering event had occurred resulting in an asset impairment charge of million related to amortizable intangible assets and property and equipment associated with our low power group 
as a result of these factors  we recorded total asset impairment charges of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   as a result of a significant downturn in handheld hardware product sales  we determined a triggering event had occurred  specifically as a result of a significant downturn in business with symbol for sales of handheld cradle products during the third quarter of  that resulted in an asset impairment charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill  amortizable intangible assets and property and equipment associated with our connectivity group business segment 
interest income  net

the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of gain on disposal of assets for the periods indicated in thousands increase decrease percentage change year annual amount from prior year from prior year the gain on disposal of assets was primarily due to our sale of a portfolio of patents and patents pending relating to our foldable keyboard intellectually property  with a net book value of  for net proceeds of approximately million which resulted in a gain of approximately  the gain on disposal of assets was primarily due to our sale of a portfolio of patents and patents pending relating to our split bridge and serialized pci intellectual property  with a net book value of  for net proceeds of approximately million  which resulted in a gain of approximately million 
litigation settlement 
litigation settlement consists of income expenses incurred in connection with the settlement of litigation 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of litigation settlement income expense for the periods indicated increase decrease year annual amount from prior year thousands certain former officers of igo corporation had sought potential indemnification claims against our wholly owned subsidiary  igo direct corporation  relating to an sec matter involving such individuals but not involving us that related to matters that arose prior to our acquisition of igo corporation in september we initiated litigation against the carrier of igo corporation s directors and officers liability insurance for coverage of these claims under its insurance policy 
during  we reached settlement agreements with two of the three former officers of igo corporation that were seeking indemnification from us  and during the quarter ended march   we settled our litigation with igo corporation s former insurance carrier  obtaining reimbursement from the insurance carrier in the amount of  further  in connection with our settlement with the insurance carrier  we reached a settlement agreement with the last of the three former officers of igo corporation and reimbursed him  in final settlement of all his indemnification claims 
we recorded net litigation settlement income of  during the year ended december  on july   the sec announced it had settled its case against each of the three former officers of igo corporation 
the litigation settlement expense consisted of a  expense incurred as a result of our settlement of litigation with tom de jong  who was a former officer of igo corporation 
mr 
de jong had sought indemnification from us for his legal expenses incurred in connection with an sec investigation 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement  we agreed to pay mr 
de jong  as full satisfaction of any indemnification claims against our wholly owned subsidiary  igo direct corporation 
income taxes 
we have incurred net operating losses from inception through the end of  therefore  no provision for income taxes was required for the years ended december   or based on historical operating losses and projections for future taxable income  it is more likely than not that we will not fully realize the 
table of contents benefits of the net operating loss carry forwards 
thus  we have not recorded a tax benefit from our net operating loss carry forwards for the years ended december   and operating outlook due to a recent world economic downturn  we have recently experienced a decline in consumer demand for our products 
it is difficult for us to predict the depth and length of this economic downturn and the corresponding impact on our business in the long term 
we expect revenue to decrease slightly from levels  primarily due to a reduction in consumer demand for mobile electronic accessories resulting from the ongoing worldwide recession  partially offset by anticipated further gains in market penetration into mobile wireless carriers  distributors and retailers largely through our sales efforts 
we expect gross margin in will be relatively consistent with gross margin 
we expect operating expenses related to our power businesses to decrease in compared to  as we expect reduced general and administrative expenses  partially offset by increased spending in sales and marketing and research and development 
we expect the operating results of mission technology group  which are included in our connectivity business segment  in will approximate the operating results 
as a result of our planned research and development efforts  we expect to further expand our intellectual property position by aggressively filing for additional patents on an ongoing basis 
a portion of these costs are recorded as research and development expense as incurred  and a portion are amortized as general and administrative expense 
we may also incur additional legal and related expenses associated with the defense and enforcement of our intellectual property portfolio  which could increase our general and administrative expenses beyond those currently planned 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow 
our available cash and cash equivalents are held in bank deposits and money market funds in the united states and the united kingdom 
our intent is that the cash balances in the united kingdom will remain there for future growth and investments  and we will meet any liquidity requirements in the united states through ongoing cash flows  external financing  or both 
we actively monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal while secondarily maximizing yield on those funds 
we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 
to date  we have experienced no material loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are with third party financial institutions 
these balances in the us may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
our primary use of cash has been to fund our operating losses  working capital requirements  acquisitions and capital expenditures necessitated by our growth 
the growth of our business has required  and will continue to require  investments in accounts receivable and inventories 
in addition to our cash flow from operations  our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by issuances of equity securities and proceeds from the sale of intellectual property assets 
we cannot assure you that these sources will be available to us in the future 
capital markets in the united states and throughout the world remain disrupted and under stress 
this disruption and stress is evidenced by a lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets  the re pricing of credit risk in the syndicated credit market and the failure of certain major financial institutions 
this stress is compounded by the ongoing severe worldwide rescission 
despite actions of the us federal government  these events have contributed to worsening general economic conditions that are materially and adversely impacting the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt capital for the market as a whole 
reflecting this concern  many lenders and capital providers have reduced  and in some cases ceased to provide  debt funding to borrowers 
the 
table of contents resulting lack of available credit  lack of confidence in the financial sector  increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely impact our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 
the following table sets forth for the period presented certain consolidated cash flow information in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities foreign currency exchange impact on cash flow increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year net cash provided by used in operating activities 
cash was provided by operating activities for the year ended december  as operating losses were more than offset by non cash expenses and decreases to accounts receivable and inventories as a result of our reduced revenue base in in  we expect to continue to generate cash from operating activities as we expect operating losses to decline and non cash items to more than offset any operating losses that may be incurred 
our consolidated cash flow operating metrics are as follows year ended december  days outstanding in ending accounts receivable dsos inventory turns the decrease in dsos at december  compared to december  was primarily due to the reductions in accounts receivable from lenovo due to the loss of that account  combined with the faster timing of payments received from targus 
we expect dsos will increase in as a result of anticipated timing of cash receipts from our customers 
the increase in inventory turns was primarily due to excess and obsolete inventory charges recorded during relating to our connectivity  low power and keyboard inventories 
we expect to manage inventory growth during and we expect inventory turns to remain consistent with net cash provided by investing activities 
for the year ended december   net cash was provided by investing activities as we generated net proceeds from the sale of investments of million and proceeds from the sale of intellectual property assets of million  partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment 
we anticipate future investment in capital equipment  primarily for tooling equipment to be used in the production of new products 
net cash provided by used in financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily from net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
although we expect to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to support our operations  we may issue additional shares of stock in the future to generate cash for growth opportunities 
investments 
at december   our investments in marketable securities included six corporate bonds and three commercial paper instruments issued by various companies with a total fair value of approximately million 
five of these securities were in an unrealized loss position  which represents less than of the book value of all marketable securities in the portfolio 

table of contents we believe we have the ability to hold all marketable securities to maturity 
however  we may dispose of securities prior to their scheduled maturity due to changes in interest rates  prepayments  tax and credit considerations  liquidity or regulatory capital requirements  or other similar factors 
as a result  we classify all marketable securities as available for sale 
these securities are reported at fair value based on third party broker statements  which represents level in the fas fair value hierarchy  with unrealized gains and losses  reported in stockholders equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
financing facilities 
in july  the line of credit we had entered into in july expired and we elected to not renew this credit facility due to our current cash and investment position 
in the future  debt financing may not be available to us in amounts or on terms that are acceptable to us 
contractual obligations 
in our day to day business activities  we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as operating leases and purchase orders 
maturities under these contracts are set forth in the following table as of december  amounts in thousands payment due by period more than years operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations totals the preceding table does not include mission technology group s contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
acquisitions and dispositions 
in the past we have made acquisitions of other companies to complement our product offerings and expand our revenue base 
in may  we acquired the assets of the foldable keyboard business from think outside  inc for million  which consideration was paid entirely by the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
in the first quarter of  we entered into three separate transactions to sell the assets of our connectivity group 
in the first transaction  we sold to cradlepoint  inc the assets of the handheld hardware product line for  in cash   in a short term receivable  million in notes receivable  of the acquirer s revenues for five years  with a minimum payment of  due within three years  and of the first  and thereafter  of any sales beyond the first million of inventory purchased by the acquirer at the closing 
as of february   cradlepoint was not in compliance with the terms of the promissory note 
the net remaining recorded balance of the million promissory note is  at march  to date  we have not recorded any receivables related to the future royalty streams due to us under the terms of the cradlepoint sale 
the second and third transactions involved the sale of substantially all of the assets of our expansion and docking business 
the agreements for these transactions were executed in february and the transactions were completed in april in one transaction  we sold a portfolio of patents and patents pending relating to our pci expansion and docking technology to ah cresant group llc 
in the other transaction  we sold substantially all of the assets related to our expansion and docking business to mission technology group  an entity that is owned by randy jones  our former senior vice president and general manager  connectivity 
as a result of these two transactions  the company received total net proceeds of approximately million consisting of  in cash and two promissory notes totaling approximately million 
at the closing  we also received a fully diluted equity interest in mission technology group 
given the related party nature of this transaction  we retained an independent  third party financial advisor to assist us 
in determining the sales price for these assets and liabilities  we evaluated past performance and expected future performance  and received an opinion from our financial advisor that the consideration to be received was fair from a financial point of view 
our board of directors approved these transactions following a separate review and recommended approval of the mission technology group transaction by our audit committee 
we include the assets  liabilities and operating results of mission technology group in our consolidated financial statements pursuant to fin r 
connectivity group revenue 
table of contents accounted for approximately of revenue for the year ended december  the operating results of mission technology group are included in the results of the connectivity group and constituted all of the operating income of this group for the year ended december  our future strategy includes the possible acquisition of other businesses to continue to expand or complement our operations 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
financing of future acquisitions would result in the utilization of cash  incurrence of additional debt  issuance of additional equity securities or a combination of all of these 
our future strategy may also include the possible disposition of assets that are not considered integral to our business  which would likely result in the generation of cash 
net operating loss carry forwards 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal  foreign and state net operating loss carry forwards which expire at various dates 
we anticipate that the sale of common stock in our initial public offering and in subsequent private offerings  as well as the issuance of our common stock for acquisitions  coupled with prior sales of common stock will cause an annual limitation on the use of our net operating loss carry forwards pursuant to the change in ownership provisions of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
this limitation is expected to have a material effect on the timing of our ability to use the net operating loss carry forwards in the future 
additionally  our ability to use the net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon our level of future profitability  which cannot be determined 
liquidity outlook 
based on our projections  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  investments and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to obtain debt financing or sell additional equity securities 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in more dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  additional capital resources may not be available to us in amounts or on terms that are acceptable to us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
to date we have not utilized derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we do not expect to employ these or other strategies to hedge market risk in the foreseeable future 
we invest our cash in money market funds  which are subject to minimal credit and market risk 
we believe that the market risks associated with these financial instruments are immaterial 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our financing facilities and capital structure 
market risk  calculated as the potential change in fair value of our cash equivalents and line of credit resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates  was not material at december
