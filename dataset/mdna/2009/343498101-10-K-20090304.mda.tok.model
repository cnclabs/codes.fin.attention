the company produces breads  buns  rolls  snack cakes and pastries that are distributed fresh to us customers in the southeast  mid atlantic  and southwest as well as select markets in california and nevada and frozen to customers nationwide 
our businesses are organized into two reportable segments dsd formerly referred to as flowers foods bakeries group  and warehouse delivery  formerly referred to as flowers foods specialty group 
the dsd segment focuses on the production and marketing of bakery products to us customers in the southeast  mid atlantic  and southwest as well as select markets in california and nevada primarily through its direct store delivery system 
the warehouse delivery segment produces snack cakes for sale to co pack  retail and vending customers nationwide as well as frozen bread  rolls and buns for sale to retail and foodservice customers nationwide primarily through warehouse distribution 
we aim to achieve consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by focusing on improvement in the operating results of our existing businesses and  after detailed analysis  acquiring businesses and properties that add 
table of contents value to the company 
we believe this consistent and sustainable growth will build value for our shareholders 
in august  the company acquired butterkrust in lakeland  florida  adding additional production capacity in the florida market 
also in august  the company acquired holsum which operates two bakeries in the phoenix  arizona area and expands the company into new geographic markets 
in november  the company purchased property in bardstown  kentucky 
in january  the company began construction of a bakery facility on this property that will produce fresh breads and buns for markets in tennessee  kentucky  ohio  and indiana 
the company expects that the facility will begin production in the spring of in february  the company acquired derst in savannah  georgia  adding markets in south carolina  eastern georgia and north florida 
in october  the company purchased land and a building in newton  north carolina and converted the building into a bakery facility 
this facility began producing buns in may and began producing bread in march of sales are principally affected by pricing  quality  brand recognition  new product introductions and product line extensions  marketing and service 
the company manages these factors to achieve a sales mix favoring its higher margin branded products  while using private label products to absorb overhead costs and maximize use of production capacity 
sales for fiscal increased from fiscal this increase was primarily due to favorable pricing and mix shifts  acquisitions and the rd week of the fiscal year 
while the company expects sales to continue to grow  it cannot guarantee that the level of growth achieved in fiscal will continue 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  periodically experience price fluctuations  and  for that reason  we continually monitor the market for these commodities 
the commodities market continues to be extremely volatile 
agricultural commodity prices reached all time high levels during and the first half of and then moderated in the second half of fiscal the cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation  weather conditions  domestic and international demand or other unforeseen circumstances 
we enter into forward purchase agreements and derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices 
any decrease in the availability of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings 
critical accounting estimates note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  raw materials  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and disclosure of the company s critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
the following is a review of the critical assumptions and estimates  and the accounting policies and methods listed below which are used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  derivative instruments  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles  self insurance reserves  income tax expense and accruals  and 
table of contents pension obligations 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the incentive 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue 
independent distributors receive a discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product sold to retailers and other customers 
the company records such amounts as selling  marketing and administrative expenses 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase distributor discounts  possibly resulting in an incremental increase in selling  marketing and administrative expenses at the time the discount is offered 
the consumer packaged goods industry has used scan based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer 
an extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer 
consequently  revenue is not recognized until the product is purchased by the consumer 
this technology is referred to as pay by scan pbs 
during  there was a sharp increase in the use of scan based trading 
the company began a pilot program in fiscal  working with certain retailers to develop the technology to execute pbs 
the company believes it is a baked foods industry leader in pbs and utilizes this technology with a majority of its larger retail customers such as wal mart  winn dixie  kroger and food lion 
in fiscal the company recorded million in sales through pbs 
the company estimates that by the end of fiscal  it will have approximately million in pbs sales 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information on the significant accounting policies 
derivative instruments 
the company s cost of primary raw materials is highly correlated to the commodities markets 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  experience price fluctuations 
if actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated  raw material prices could increase significantly  adversely affecting our results of operations 
we enter into forward purchase agreements and derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of volatility in raw material prices 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles 
the company records an impairment charge to property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards when  based on certain indicators of impairment  it believes such assets have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to long lived assets were necessary for fiscal years or there was an impairment charge of million recorded in fiscal  as discussed below in results of operations 
the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired using a two step process 
the first step of this evaluation is performed by calculating the fair value of the business segment  or reporting unit  with which the goodwill is associated 
this fair value is calculated as the average of projected ebitda defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization using a reasonable multiplier  projected revenue using a reasonable multiplier and a discounted cash flow model using a reasonable discount rate 
this fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit  and if less than the carrying value  the goodwill is measured for potential impairment under step two 
under step two of this calculation  goodwill is measured for potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  determined in the same manner as a business combination  with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to goodwill were necessary for the fiscal years ended january   december   or december  in connection with acquisitions  the company has acquired trademarks  customer lists and non compete agreements  which are intangible assets subject to amortization 
the company evaluates these assets whenever 
table of contents events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the undiscounted future cash flows of each intangible asset is compared to the carrying amount  and if less than the carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to intangible assets were necessary for the fiscal years ended january   december   or december  the company also owns trademarks acquired in acquisitions that are intangible assets not subject to amortization 
the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of these intangible assets on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in addition  the useful life is evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life 
the fair value is compared to the carrying value of the intangible asset  and if less than the carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to fair value 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to intangible assets were necessary for the fiscal years ended january   december   or december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further information relating to the company s goodwill and other intangible assets 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for various levels of general liability  auto liability  workers compensation and employee medical and dental coverage 
insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends 
projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims  historical trends and data 
though the company does not expect them to do so  actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated 
material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
income tax expense and accruals 
the annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
changes in statutory rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material effect on the annual tax rate 
the effect of these changes  if any  would be recognized when the change takes place 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of future taxes to be paid in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these assessments relate to both permanent and temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  as well as estimates of our current tax exposures 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance  which could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
periodically we face audits from federal and state tax authorities  which can result in challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it more likely than not that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  that may impact our ultimate payment of such exposures 
while the ultimate outcome of audits cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not currently believe that future audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for more information on income taxes 
pension obligations 
the company records pension costs and benefit obligations related to its defined benefit plans based on actuarial valuations 
these valuations reflect key assumptions determined by management  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plan portfolio  past performance of these assets  the anticipated future economic environment and long term performance of individual asset classes  and other factors 
material changes in pension costs and in benefit obligations may occur in the future due to experience different than assumed and changes in these assumptions 
future benefit obligations and annual pension costs could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions 
table of contents to the plan and other factors 
effective january   the company curtailed its largest defined benefit plan that covered the majority of its workforce 
benefits under this plan were frozen  and no future benefits will accrue under this plan 
the company continues to maintain a plan that covers a small number of certain union employees 
effective august   the company assumed sponsorship of two defined benefit plans as part of the butterkrust acquisition 
benefits under these plans are frozen  and no future benefits will accrue under these plans 
the company recorded pension income of million for fiscal a quarter percentage point change in the discount rate would impact the company s fiscal pension income by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point change in the long term expected rate of return would impact the company s fiscal pension income by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the company s fiscal year end pension obligations by approximately million 
a quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company s fiscal year end pension obligations by approximately million 
the company expects pension costs of approximately million for fiscal the discount rate used by the company reflects rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
as permitted under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the company looks to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments to determine its discount rate 
the company uses a cash flow matching technique to select the discount rate 
the expected cash flows of each pension plan are matched to a yield curve based on aa graded bonds available in the marketplace at the measurement date 
a present value is developed  which is then used to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date  the company considers the plan assets historical actual returns  targeted asset allocations  and the anticipated future economic environment and long term performance of individual asset classes  based on the company s investment strategy 
while appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance  the assumption represents management s best estimate of the long term prospective return 
based on these factors the long term rate of return assumption for the plans was set at for fiscal  as compared with the average annual return on the plan assets over the past years of approximately net of investment expenses 
the expected long term rate of return assumption is based on a target asset allocation of equity securities  debt securities  other diversifying strategies including  but not limited to  absolute return funds  real estate and cash 
the company regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the plan assets to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
pension costs do not include an explicit investment management expense assumption and the return on assets rate reflects the long term expected return  net of investment expenses 
the company determines the fair value of substantially all its plan assets utilizing market quotes rather than developing smoothed values  market related values or other modeling techniques 
plan asset gains or losses in a given year are included with other actuarial gains and losses due to remeasurement of the plans projected benefit obligations pbo 
if the total unrecognized gain or loss exceeds of the larger of i the pbo or ii the market value of plan assets  the excess of the total unrecognized gain or loss is amortized over the estimated average future lifetime of participants in the frozen pension plans 
the total unrecognized gain as of the fiscal measurement date of december  for the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
the total unrecognized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of december  for the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
amortization of this unrecognized loss during fiscal is expected to be approximately million 
to the extent that this unrecognized loss is subsequently recognized  then this loss will increase the company s pension costs in the future 
on september   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
sfas was effective for public companies for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of sfas at december   the end of its fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for information regarding the company s postretirement plans 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company contributed million  million  and million  respectively  to the defined benefit plans 
because of lower than expected asset returns during  
table of contents contributions in future years are expected to increase 
during  the company expects to contribute approximately million to its pension plans 
this amount represents estimated minimum pension contributions required under erisa and the pension protection act of ppa as well as discretionary contributions to avoid benefit restrictions 
this amount represents estimates that are based on assumptions that are subject to change 
the amounts may also change due to additional regulatory guidance under the act which is forthcoming 
the worker  retiree  and employer recovery act of wrera was signed into law on december  wrera grants plan sponsors relief from certain funding requirements and benefit restrictions  and also provides some technical corrections to the ppa 
one of the technical corrections allows the use of asset smoothing  with limitations  for up to a month period in determining funding requirements 
the company has not yet determined whether it will elect this option 
if the company were to elect this option  contributions may be deferred to later years or reduced through market recovery 
the company continues to review various contribution scenarios based on current market conditions and options available to plan sponsors under the ppa 
in assessing different scenarios  the company believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without affecting the business strategy of the company 
matters affecting analysis reporting periods

information regarding non gaap financial measures the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
however  from time to time  the company may present in its public statements  press releases and sec filings  ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  to measure the performance of the company and its operating divisions 
ebitda is used as the primary performance measure in the company s annual executive bonus plan 
the company defines ebitda as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and minority interest 
the company believes that ebitda is a useful tool for managing the operations of its business and is an indicator of the company s ability to incur and service indebtedness and generate free cash flow 
furthermore  pursuant to the terms of our credit facility  ebitda is used to determine the company s compliance with certain financial covenants 
the company also believes that ebitda measures are commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as measures of a company s operating performance and debt servicing ability because they assist in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation or amortization  which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods and non operating factors such as historical cost 
ebitda is also a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service indebtedness 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to a income from operations or net income loss as a measure of operating performance  b cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s ability to meet its cash needs  or c any other indicator of performance or liquidity that has been determined in accordance with gaap
