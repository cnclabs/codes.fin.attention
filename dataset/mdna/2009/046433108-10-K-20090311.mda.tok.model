risk factors the current capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to capital  cost of capital and business operations 
recently  the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly and have adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital 
if these conditions continue or become worse  our future cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital markets could be adversely affected 
any inability to obtain adequate financing from debt and equity sources could force us to self fund strategic initiatives or even forgo some opportunities  potentially harming our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
the amount of debt we have outstanding  as well as any debt we may incur in the future  could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding  of which million is long term debt 
our revolving credit facility as of december   totaled million and is made available through a group of banks 
on january   the company amended this credit facility by entering into an million amended and restated credit agreement dated as of january  with a group of banks 
the new credit agreement provides for a five year  million senior secured term loan with interest at libor plus between and based on the company s leverage ratio  payable in quarterly installments of million 
the credit agreement also provides for a revolving credit line of million  of which approximately million is currently available for working capital requirements with interest at libor plus between and 
the credit facility allocates up to million of the million revolving credit line for the issuance of letters of credit  including certain existing letters of credit totaling approximately million at december  the company s obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by a first priority lien on virtually all the assets of the company 
in addition  on january   the company issued to the former shareholders of dme a subordinated promissory note due in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the company also issued a subordinated contingent promissory note due in the aggregate principal amount of million  which is due only upon satisfaction of certain revenue performance criteria for changes to our level of debt subsequent to december  could have significant consequences to our business  including the following depending on interest rates and debt maturities  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy  capital expenditures or other purposes  a significant amount of debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates  our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired  the increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding increases the risk of non compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios  and we may be more leveraged than some of our competitors  which may result in a competitive disadvantage 
the markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events  which may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors  including capital investment  product innovations  economic growth  and technology upgrades 
in addition  the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to fuel price increases  labor disputes and global economic conditions 
a change in any of these factors could result in a reduction in the amount of air travel 
a reduction in air travel would reduce orders for new aircraft and reductions in cabin upgrades by airlines for which we supply products and for the sales of spare parts  
table of contents thus reducing our sales and profits 
a reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all 
we are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the near future 
as with any new program there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market 
as is customary for our business we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer 
if a program or aircraft is not successful we may have to write off all or a part of the inventory  accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program 
a write off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements 
this could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bond debt 
our products are sold in highly competitive markets 
some of our competitors are larger  more diversified corporations and have greater financial  marketing  production and research and development resources 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors develop products that are superior to our products  develop products that are more competitively priced than our products  develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
we believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality  price  design and engineering capabilities  product development  conformity to customer specifications  quality of support after the sale  timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization 
maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing  engineering  quality standards  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
if we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments  or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position  our operations and financial performance will suffer 
the loss of panasonic avionics corporation as a major customer or a significant reduction in sales to panasonic would reduce our sales and earnings 
in we had a concentration of sales to panasonic representing of our sales 
the loss of this customer or a significant reduction in sales to this customer would significantly reduce our sales and earnings 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel 
the loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business 
in addition  competition for qualified technical personnel in our industries is intense  and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract  train and retain such personnel 
future terror attacks  war  or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business 
continued terror attacks  war or other disturbances could lead to further economic instability and decreases in demand for our products  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist attacks world wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry 
the long term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown 
these attacks and the us government s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability 
if we are unable to adapt to technological change  demand for our products may be reduced 
the technologies related to our products have undergone  and in the future may undergo  significant changes 
to succeed in the future  we will need to continue to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
our competitors may develop 
table of contents technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive 
furthermore  our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge 
we may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive  and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers 
our new product development efforts may not be successful  which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements  and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers 
in addition  the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates  and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs 
if any of these events occur  our sales and profits could be adversely affected 
if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations  our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted 
many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers 
there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors  including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor 
failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer 
subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
in addition  a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability 
our results of operations are affected by our fixed price contracts  which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns 
for the year ended december   fixed price contracts represented of our sales 
on fixed price contracts  we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price 
depending on the fixed price negotiated  these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract s fixed price 
however  we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit 
some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties 
failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems  development schedule slides  manufacturing difficulties  or similar schedule related events could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the failure of our products may damage our reputation  necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage  thereby requiring us to pay significant damages 
defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall 
we include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products 
if any of our products are defective  we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims 
such an event could result in significant expenses  disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products 
we are also exposed to product liability claims 
we carry aircraft and non aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms 
however  this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim 
a product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our facilities could be damaged by catastrophes which could reduce our production capacity and result in a loss of customers 
we conduct our operations in facilities located in the united states and canada 
any of these facilities could be damaged by fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunication and information systems failure or similar events 
although we carry property insurance  including business interruption insurance  our inability to meet customers schedules as a result of catastrophe may result in a loss of customers or significant additional costs such as penalty claims under customer contracts 

table of contents contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation  including rules related to bidding  billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims  and any non compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment 
like all government contractors  we are subject to risks associated with this contracting 
these risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties 
these fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules  employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards  receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims 
we have been  and expect to continue to be  subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies 
the failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation 
it could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts 
changes in discount rates and other factors could affect our future earnings and equity 
pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions 
the most critical assumption is the discount rate 
other assumptions include salary increases and retirement age 
the discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control 
changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity 
we are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business  liquidity and operating results 
changes in the availability  terms and cost of capital  increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage 
at december   of our debt was at fixed interest rates with the remaining subject to variable interest rates 
on january   in conjunction with an acquisition of dme  the company entered into a new credit facility  causing of our debt to be variable and of our debt to be fixed 
in addition  our new debt financing contains various financial covenants 
if our financial performance differs from our expectation we may violate one or more of those covenants 
a covenant violation would require a waiver by the lenders or an alternative financing arrangement be achieved 
historically both choices have been available to us however in the current credit market environment it is difficult to predict the availability of these options in the future 
we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from our customers defaulting on their obligations to us 
the inability of our customers to pay us due to adverse economic conditions or their inability to access available credit could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
our international operations pose currency and other risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings 
we have manufacturing and sales operations in foreign countries 
in addition  our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers 
our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into us dollars 
the translation of our sales in foreign currencies  which are primarily the canadian dollar to the us dollar had an insignificant impact on both sales for using average exchange rates for compared to average exchange rates for and on sales for using average exchange rates for compared to average exchange rates for we depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and sub contractors that may not be fully funded  may be terminated  or may be awarded to our competitors 
the failure to be awarded these contracts or failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales 
sales to the us government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business 
the funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations  and congressional priorities are subject to change 
in addition  government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated 
a decline in governmental expenditures may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us 
government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the united states and otherwise adversely affect our business 
our failure to obtain the requisite licenses  meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products outside the united states 
compliance with these government regulations may 
table of contents also subject us to additional fees and operating costs 
the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position 
in order to sell our products in european union countries  we must satisfy certain technical requirements 
if we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products  our sales in europe would be restricted 
doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations  including  without limitation  regulations relating to import export control  technology transfer restrictions  foreign corrupt practices and anti boycott provisions 
failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative  civil or criminal liabilities and could  in the extreme case  result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
if we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our revenue or operating results  our stock price could decline significantly 
our revenue and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including delays or cancellations of programs 
it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the trading price of our stock could decline significantly 
our sales and earnings may be reduced if we cannot successfully integrate dme s business 
if we are unable to successfully integrate dme s businesses subsequent to the acquisition on january   into our existing operations or if dme s business is unsuccessful in winning new government programs  our sales and earnings could be impacted

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview astronics corporation  through its subsidiaries astronics advanced electronic systems corp  luminescent systems inc and luminescent systems canada inc designs and manufactures electrical power generation  control and distribution systems and lighting systems and components  for the aerospace industry 
we operate four principal facilities located in new york state  new hampshire  washington state and quebec  canada 
we serve the three primary aircraft markets which are the military  commercial transport and the business jet markets 
in  the breakdown of sales to the commercial transport market  the military market and the business jet market were  and  respectively  miscellaneous sales to non aerospace markets accounted for of sales 
astronics strategy is to develop and maintain positions of technical leadership in its chosen aerospace and defense markets  to leverage those positions to grow the amount of content and volume of product it sells to those markets and to selectively acquire businesses with similar technical capabilities that could benefit from our leadership position and strategic direction 

table of contents in january astronics acquired dme corporation dme  a designer and manufacturer of military test  training and simulation equipment and aviation safety products 
astronics purchased percent of the outstanding stock of dme for approximately million 
the acquisition was financed with a million  five year term note with quarterly principal payments of million beginning in the second quarter of   shares of unregistered astronics common stock and seller financing for million to million depending on achieving a revenue target of million in the seller notes are due in key factors affecting astronics growth  revenue and profitability are the rate at which new aircraft are produced  government funding of military programs  our ability to have our products designed into the plans for new aircraft and the rates at which aircraft owners  including commercial airlines  refurbish or install upgrades to their aircraft 
once designed into a new aircraft  the spare parts business is frequently retained by the company 
sales to the commercial transport market totaled approximately of our total revenue in our cabin electronics products which provide in seat power for passengers and power to in flight entertainment systems ife found on commercial airlines around the world accounted for the majority of our sales to this market 
since we have seen our sales to the commercial transport markets increase from million to over million in most of this growth has been driven by increased installations of our cabin electronics products used to power in flight entertainment systems and in seat power systems by airlines around the world 
maintaining and growing our sales to the commercial transport market will depend on airlines capital spending budgets for cabin up grades as well as for new aircraft such as the boeing and airbus a we expect these new aircraft  once in production will be equipped with more ife and in seat power than previous generation aircraft 
additionally  our ability to maintain and grow sales to this market depends on our ability to maintain our technological advantages over our competitors and maintain our relationships with major in flight entertainment suppliers and global airlines 
our military market sales are typically comprised of several significant programs such as providing a power conversion unit for the tactical tomahawk and taurus missiles and lighting and fire suppression units for v osprey programs complemented by many spare parts orders covering many aircraft platforms 
products sold to the military market include our cockpit  exterior and cabin lighting and airframe power products 
the military market is dependent on governmental funding which can change from year to year 
risks are that overall spending may be reduced in the future  specific programs may be eliminated or that we fail to win new business through the competitive bid process 
astronics does not have significant reliance on any one program such that cancellation of a particular program will cause material financial loss 
we believe that we will continue to have opportunities similar to past years regarding this market 
another market we serve is the business jet market 
sales to the business jet market are driven by our increasing content on new aircraft and build rates of new aircraft 
in we saw volume and average ship set value increase in the business jet market as the production rates for new business jets increased during the year 
products sold to the business jet market include our cockpit lighting  airframe power and exterior lighting products 
our sales to the business jet market will be particularly challenged in the upcoming years as aircraft production rates are expected to be reduced significantly from levels as the global economy struggles 
additionally  there is a large supply of used aircraft in the market and financing of new aircraft has become more challenging for prospective buyers 
our largest business jet customer during  eclipse aviation corporation filed for bankruptcy protection in november of in astronics had revenue totaling approximately million from eclipse 
relating to this  in the fourth quarter astronics took a pre tax charge to income for million for outstanding accounts receivable  inventory  tooling and fixed assets relating to the eclipse aircraft 
despite the current market conditions  we continue to see a wide range of opportunities to employ our technology in the business jet markets  however there is risk involved in the development of any new aircraft 
each of the markets that we serve is presenting opportunities for our product lines that we expect will provide continued growth for the company over the long term 
we continue to look for opportunities in all three markets to capitalize on our core competencies to expand our existing business and to grow through strategic acquisitions 

table of contents in we expect our revenue to increase as a result of the january  acquisition of dme corporation 
we are projecting revenues to be in the range of million to million 
impacted by current economic conditions  the aerospace market is extremely difficult to predict at this time as new aircraft production rates are modified frequently by the airframe manufacturers creating a very fluid and difficult to predict revenue stream over the next twelve months 
excluding dme revenue we expect organic astronics revenue to be in the range of million to million based on information available at this time 
we expect fairly flat sales to the commercial transport market and military markets and a decrease in the business jet market 
we expect dme revenue to be in the range of million to million for the eleven month period after closing of the acquisition as we await the results on several significant contract awards that could impact revenue 
revenue for can be affected by not only the ultimate award of the contract  but the timing of when the contract is awarded and when delivery begins 
despite expected lower organic revenue as compared with  we still see many opportunities for long term growth and expect to continue to invest in developmental programs to expand our products and technologies 
in addition  we expect that the next generation of commercial transports such as the boeing and airbus a will be equipped with more in seat power and in flight entertainment than the aircraft they will be replacing 
we expect this will provide a significant opportunity for us as these aircraft enter and ramp up production over the next several years 
challenges which continue to face us include improving shareholder value through increasing profitability 
increasing profitability is dependent on many things  primarily revenue growth and  the company s ability to control operating expenses and to identify means of creating improved productivity 
revenue is driven by increased build rates for existing aircraft  market acceptance and economic success of new aircraft  continued government funding of defense programs  the company s ability to obtain production contracts for parts we currently supply or have been selected to design and develop for new aircraft platforms 
demand for our products is driven by the discretionary spending of aircraft owners and airlines and new aircraft build rates 
reduced aircraft build rates driven by a weak economy  tight credit markets  reduced air passenger travel and an increasing supply of used aircraft on the market will likely result in reduced demand for our products which will result in lower profits 
many of our newer development programs are based on new and unproven technology and at the same time we are challenged to develop the technology on a schedule that is consistent with specific aircraft development programs 
we will continue to address these challenges by working to improve operating efficiencies and focusing on executing on the growth opportunities currently in front of us 
acquisition on january   the company acquired of the common stock of dme 
the purchase price was approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash   shares of the company s common stock previously held as treasury shares  valued at million  or per share  a million subordinated note payable to the former shareholders plus an additional million subject to meeting revenue performance criteria in dme corporation is a provider of weapons and communications test equipment  training and simulation devices and aviation safety solutions 
audited financial statements for dme and pro forma combined financial information for astronics and dme will be available and included in a form k filing expected to be filed in april in connection with the funding of this acquisition  the company amended its existing million credit facility by entering into an million amended and restated credit agreement dated january   with hsbc bank usa  national association  bank of america  na and keybank national association 
the credit agreement provides for a five year  million senior secured term loan with interest at libor plus between and based on the company s leverage ratio 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to finance the acquisition

in addition  the company is required to pay a commitment fee of between and on the unused portion of the total credit commitment for the preceding quarter  based on the company s leverage ratio under the credit 
table of contents agreement 
the credit facility allocates up to million of the million revolving credit line for the issuance of letters of credit  including certain existing letters of credit 
a portion of the purchase price was funded by the issuance to the former shareholders of dme a subordinated promissory note due in the aggregate principal amount of million 
to evidence its obligations related to the contingent payment  the company also issued a subordinated contingent promissory note due in the aggregate principal amount of million 
payment under the contingent promissory note is due depending on achieving a revenue target for dme of million in the company s obligations under the credit agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by astronics advanced electronic systems corp  luminescent systems  inc and dme  each a wholly owned domestic subsidiary of the company 
the obligations are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the company s and the guarantors assets 
in the event of voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of the company  all unpaid principal and any other amounts due under the credit agreement automatically become due and payable without presentation  demand or notice of any kind to the company 
other events of default  including failure to make payments as they become due  give the agent the option to declare all unpaid principal and any other amounts then due  immediately due and payable 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are affected by management s application of accounting policies  which are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  note of
