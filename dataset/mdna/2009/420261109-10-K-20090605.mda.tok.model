item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for our fiscal years ended march   march   and april  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of bulk and specialty chemicals to our customers in a wide variety of industries 
we began our operations primarily as a distributor of bulk chemicals with a strong customer focus 
over the years we have maintained the strong customer focus and have expanded our business by increasing our sales of value added specialty chemical products  including repackaging  blending and manufacturing certain products 
in recent years  we significantly expanded the sales of our higher margin blended and manufactured products  including our food grade products 
we expect this specialty chemical portion of our business to continue to grow 
we have continued to invest in growing our business 
in fiscal  we acquired the assets of trumark  inc  a producer of antimicrobial products for the food industry  for approximately  these operations have been consolidated into our industrial group 
in fiscal  we also opened two new warehouses for our water treatment group to expand its geographic coverage 
in fiscal  we invested in two new facilities  which we expect will expand our ability to service our customers and facilitate growth within our industrial group 
our new facility in centralia  illinois  will primarily serve our food grade products business and is expected to become operational in june we also opened a facility in minneapolis  minnesota  to handle bulk chemicals sold to pharmaceutical manufacturers 
the total capital expenditures in fiscal on these two facilities were approximately  with approximately  of additional capital spending on these facilities expected in fiscal we opened one warehouse for our water treatment group in the first quarter of fiscal and expect to continue to invest in new branches to expand our geographic coverage 
the cost of these new branches is not expected to be material 
in february  we entered into two agreements whereby we agreed to sell our inventory and enter into a marketing relationship regarding the business of our pharmaceutical segment  which provided pharmaceutical chemicals to retail pharmacies and small scale pharmaceutical manufacturers 
the transaction closed in may and we have no significant obligations to fulfill under the agreements 
the results of the pharmaceutical segment have been reported as discontinued operations in our financial statements and notes to financial statements for all periods presented in this annual report on form k 
our financial performance in fiscal was highlighted by sales from continuing operations of  a increase over fiscal  gross profit from continuing operations of  or of sales  an increase of  over our gross profit in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities of  an increase of over that of fiscal  and cash and cash equivalents of  as of the end of fiscal the prices of the majority of our primary raw materials increased substantially and rapidly during the first three quarters of fiscal due to high demand and  in some cases constrained supply 
due to this rapid escalation in pricing  we benefited from selling at the higher market prices the lower cost inventory that we had on hand  in part as a result of our strategic investments made in storage capacity over the last several years 
in addition  our ability to continue to obtain supplies of key raw material ingredients at favorable prices while many of our competitors were facing raw material shortages and a resultant inability to supply their customers  allowed us to significantly expand our market share to new and existing customers 
we expect to retain a portion of this new business  but expect a portion of it to return to our competition 
these market and supply factors significantly increased our sales and gross profit in fiscal compared to prior periods 
the raw material supply constraints experienced by our industry in fiscal have eased and commodity prices have leveled off or  in many cases  begun to decline with the slowing economy 
with the changes in commodity pricing and decreases in demand resulting from the national economic downturn  we expect our fiscal business and the gross profit realized to return to levels more in line with our historic results prior to fiscal while market forces in fiscal generated higher gross profit dollars and gross profit margins as a percentage of sales than we had experienced in the past  we seek to maintain relatively constant gross profit dollars on each of our products as the cost of our commodity chemical raw materials increase or decrease 
our product costs are subject to fluctuations  which are expected to continue in future periods 
with this volatility in cost and the resulting fluctuations in selling prices  we believe that gross profit dollars is the best measure of our profitability from the sale of our products 
if we maintain relatively stable profit dollars on each of our products  our reported gross margin percentage will decrease when the cost of the product increases and will increase when the cost of the product decreases 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of valuing inventory  which causes the most recent product costs to be recognized in our income statement 
the lifo inventory valuation method and the resulting cost of sales are consistent with our business practices of pricing to current commodity chemical raw material prices 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statement of income as a percentage of sales from period to period 
fiscal fiscal fiscal sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income investment income income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income fiscal compared to fiscal sales sales increased  or  to  for fiscal  as compared to sales of  for fiscal sales of bulk chemicals  including caustic soda  were approximately of sales compared to approximately in the previous year 
caustic soda volumes sold were comparable to the prior year 
industrial segment 
industrial segment sales increased  or  to  for fiscal the sales increase was primarily attributable to increases in selling prices related to rising material costs along existing product lines and supply constraints for certain products as well as higher volumes in higher value manufactured and specialty chemical products driven by increased demand 
water treatment segment 
water treatment segment sales increased  or  to  for fiscal the sales increase was primarily attributable to price increases related to increased material costs and expansion of sales of existing product lines  including specialty chemical products  to new and existing customers 
gross profit gross profit was  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to  or of sales  for fiscal lifo charges reduced gross profit by  in fiscal and  in fiscal to more accurately reflect their underlying nature  certain expenses that were classified as selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal are now classified as cost of sales in fiscal these expenses totaled  in fiscal industrial segment 
gross profit for the industrial segment was  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to  or of sales  for fiscal the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin as a percent of sales were primarily driven by the sale of lower cost inventory on hand in a period of rapidly escalating market prices and  to a lesser degree  an increase in profits and volumes on certain products where we had the inventory to meet escalating demand from current and new customers during a period of constrained supply 
this was partially offset by a decrease in demand for lower margin products sold into the agricultural markets during the second half of fiscal as compared to the second half of fiscal additionally  charges related to the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit in this segment by  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal water treatment segment 
gross profit for the water treatment segment was  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to  or of sales  for fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the sale of lower cost inventory on hand and increased demand for specialty chemical products 
the decrease in gross profit margin as a percent of sales was due to increased raw material costs 
additionally  charges related to the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit in this segment by  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to  or of sales  for fiscal the decrease in expense in fiscal was primarily due to the reclassification of certain expenses as cost of sales in fiscal  which were classified as sg a in fiscal these expenses totaled  in fiscal additionally  sg a expenses were reduced by the reduction of contractor and consulting fees related to our implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system and approximately  of non recurring acquisition related expenses associated with the trumark acquisition recorded in the first quarter of fiscal these reductions were partially offset by increased variable pay expenses that we paid as a result of the higher profitability levels achieved in fiscal operating income operating income was  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to  or of sales  for fiscal of the fiscal increase of   was attributable to the industrial segment  and  was attributable to the water treatment segment 
the increases were driven primarily by higher than usual profits on certain products due to the sale of lower cost inventory during a period of rapidly escalating commodity chemical prices and higher margins caused by supply constraints for certain products as well as higher volumes of sales of higher value manufactured and specialty chemical products which were driven by increased demand 
shortages of certain raw materials in our industrial segment restricted the ability of certain competitors to meet their customers product requirements  while our inventory position allowed us to meet the requirements of our current customer base and to expand our business and to add additional customers 
investment income investment income was  for fiscal  as compared to  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower average investment balances during the year due to higher working capital requirements and capacity expansion projects initiated during fiscal the decrease was also attributable to lower yields on investment balances in the current year as compared to the prior year 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the higher effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in pre tax income subject to higher marginal income tax rates and the reversal of a valuation allowance and tax contingency reserve in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal sales sales increased  or  to  for fiscal  as compared to sales of  for fiscal sales of bulk chemicals  including caustic soda  were approximately of sales compared to approximately in the previous year 
caustic soda volumes sold were comparable to the prior year 
industrial segment 
industrial segment sales increased  or  to  for fiscal sales were impacted by the acquisition of trumark  inc completed in may  which accounted for approximately of the increase in sales in fiscal the remaining portion of the increase in sales was primarily attributable to price increases related to increased material costs as well as higher volumes of sales of certain products 
water treatment segment 
water treatment segment sales increased  or  to  for fiscal the sales increase was primarily attributable to price increases related to increased material costs  successful expansion of sales of existing product lines  including specialty chemical products  to new and existing customers  and volume increases during the first quarter of fiscal related to favorable weather conditions 
gross profit gross profit was  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to  or of sales  for fiscal lifo charges reduced gross profit by  in fiscal and increased gross profit by  in fiscal industrial segment 
gross profit for the industrial segment was  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to  or of sales  for fiscal changes in product mix toward higher volume  lower margin products and higher material costs negatively impacted gross profit margin as a percent of sales 
additionally  charges related to the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted fiscal gross profit by  and positively impacted fiscal by  water treatment segment 
gross profit for the water treatment segment was  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to  or of sales  for fiscal the fiscal increase related primarily to an increase in seasonal volumes sold and favorable changes in product mix 
the increase was partially offset by charges related to the lifo method of valuing inventory that negatively impacted fiscal gross profit by  compared to  for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales  for fiscal compared to  or of sales  for fiscal the acquisition of trumark accounted for approximately  of the  increase in fiscal this included the amortization of intangible assets and approximately  of non recurring acquisition related expenses 
the increase in expense was also driven by higher employee compensation  including the issuance of restricted stock  sales incentive compensation expense  and a full year of depreciation expense related to the erp system 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional and consulting expenses related to the erp implementation 
operating income operating income was  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to  or of sales  for fiscal the increase of  in fiscal was driven by higher gross profits in both the water treatment and industrial segments  partially offset by higher sg a expenses 
investment income investment income was  for fiscal  as compared to  for fiscal the decrease was primarily related to an approximately  gain realized on the repayment of three notes receivable that were paid in full during the fourth quarter of fiscal  lower average investment balances due to the trumark acquisition and lower yields on investments 
this was partially offset by a  gain on the sale of a mutual fund in fiscal provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the lower effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance and tax contingency reserve in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to the increase in net income and was partially offset by higher working capital balances caused by the higher commodity chemical costs in inventory and the resulting increase in selling prices which resulted in higher accounts receivable balances 
due to the nature of our operations  which includes purchases of large quantities of bulk chemicals  the timing of purchases can result in significant changes in working capital investment and the resulting operating cash flow 
historically  our cash requirements for working capital increase during the period from april through november as caustic soda inventory levels increase as the majority of barges are received during this period 
additionally  due to the seasonality of the water treatment business  our trade receivable balance generally increases during this period 
cash and investments available for sale of  at march  increased by  as compared with the  available as of march   primarily due to the increase in cash generated from operations that was partially offset by capital expenditures and dividend payments 
in february  we sold our remaining investments classified as available for sale 
the  balance at march  consisted entirely of cash and cash equivalents 
cash equivalents consist of a money market account and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the total capital expenditures in fiscal for our new facilities projects were approximately  additional significant capital expenditures during fiscal consisted of approximately  for facilities improvements and increased storage capacity   for returnable containers  and  for new route sales trucks 
we expect that recurring capital expenditures for storage  facilities improvements  returnable containers  and new route sales trucks in fiscal will be comparable with the fiscal spend rate 
we also plan to spend approximately  to complete the new facilities projects that we started in fiscal we expect our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures in fiscal dividends our board of directors increased our semi annual cash dividend by during the second quarter of fiscal to per share from per share 
we first started paying cash dividends in and have continued to do so since 
future dividend levels will be dependent upon our results of operations  financial position  cash flows and other factors  and will be evaluated by our board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period contractual obligation more than years total operating lease obligations critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements  we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we re evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we consider the following policies to involve the most judgment in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is evidence that the customer has agreed to purchase the product  the price and terms of the sale are fixed  the product has shipped and title passes to our customer  performance has occurred  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
on a quarterly basis  management assesses the inventory quantities on hand to estimated future usage and sales and  if necessary  writes down to net realizable the value of inventory deemed obsolete or excess 
though management considers these reserves adequate and proper  changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could materially affect the adequacy of this reserve 
lifo reserve inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
we may incur significant fluctuations in our gross margins due primarily to changes in the cost of a single  large volume component of inventory 
the price of this inventory component may fluctuate depending on the balance between supply and demand 
management reviews the lifo reserve on a quarterly basis 
impairment of long lived assets we review the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used  such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable  such as prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group  an impairment is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets 
the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long lived assets 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets subject to amortization 
there were no material assets that were determined to be impaired during fiscal self insurance we purchase insurance for employee medical benefits with high deductibles 
we carry third party insurance for what we believe to be the major portion of potential exposures that would exceed our self insured retentions 
we have established a liability for potential uninsured claims 
we consider factors such as known outstanding claims  historical experience  and other relevant factors in estimating the liability 
these reserves are monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
though management believes these reserves are adequate  a substantial change in the number and or severity of claims could result in materially different amounts for this item 
income taxes in the preparation of our financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating the current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely 
reserves are also established for potential and ongoing audits of federal and state tax issues 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of such situations and believe that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to amounts owed and tax rates could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates  our future taxable income levels and the results of tax audits
