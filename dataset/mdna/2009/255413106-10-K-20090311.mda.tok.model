item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussions and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we create products and services designed to improve the experience of media 
our long term goal is to allow creators to have the ability to capture their content in the divx format using any device or software of their choosing and to allow consumers of such content to playback and interact with it on any device or platform 
the first step towards our goal was to build and release a high quality video compression decompression software library  or codec  to enable distribution of content across the internet and through recordable media 
as a result  we created the divx codec  which has been actively sought out and downloaded by consumers hundreds of millions of times 
these downloads include those for which we receive revenue as well as free downloads  such as limited time trial versions  and downloads provided as upgrades to existing end users of our products 
after the significant grass roots adoption of our codec  the next step towards our goal was to license similar technology to consumer hardware device manufacturers and certify their products to ensure the interoperable support of divx encoded content 
in january  we took another step forward by releasing to consumers and licensing to hardware device manufacturers a version of our technology built around a new codec  the divx plus 
table of contents codec 
divx plus technology offers enhancements over prior versions of our codecs for certain implementations  including for high definition and mobile content 
divx certified hardware devices have been shipped worldwide by our customers who include major consumer video hardware original equipment manufacturers 
we are entitled to receive a royalty and or license fee for divx certified devices that our customers ship 
in addition to technology licensing to consumer hardware device manufacturers  we currently generate revenue from software licensing and related support  advertising and content distribution 
complementing our organic growth  in november  we acquired mainconcept gmbh  or mainconcept  a leading provider of h 
and a wide range of other high quality video codecs and technologies for the broadcast  film  consumer electronics and computer software markets 
mainconcept solutions are optimized for various platforms including pcs  set top boxes  portable media players and mobile phones 
through integration  we expect to realize additional opportunities both in our core markets and in related emerging markets that will continue to help advance our long term goals 
our next steps  which we have begun working toward  are to bring together the millions of divx consumers with content creators both large and small to build communities around media  including through the development and licensing of media distribution platforms and services for the internet and consumer electronics devices 
sources of revenues we have four revenue streams 
three of these revenue streams are derived from our technologies  including technology licensing to manufacturers of consumer hardware devices  licensing to independent software vendors and consumers  and providing services related to content distribution over the internet 
additionally  we derive revenues from advertising and distributing third party products on our website 
our technology licensing revenues from consumer hardware device manufacturers comprise the majority of our total revenues and are derived primarily from royalties and or license fees received from original equipment manufacturers  although related revenues are derived from other members of the consumer hardware device supply chain 
we license our technologies to original equipment manufacturers  allowing them to build support of divx technologies into their consumer hardware devices 
in the majority of cases  original equipment manufacturers pay us a per unit fee for each divx certified device they sell 
our license agreements with original equipment manufacturers typically range from one to two years  and may include the payment of initial fees  volume based royalties and minimum guaranteed volume levels 
to ensure high quality support of the divx media format in finished consumer products  we also license our technologies to companies who create the major components in consumer hardware devices 
these companies include integrated circuit manufacturers who supply integrated circuits  and original design manufacturers who create reference designs  for dvd players  digital televisions  mobile phones  and the other consumer hardware devices distributed by our licensee original equipment manufacturers 
because royalties are generated by the shipment volumes of our consumer hardware device customers  and because sales by consumer hardware device manufacturers are highly seasonal  we expect revenues relating to consumer hardware devices to be highly seasonal  with our second quarter revenues in any given calendar year being generally lower than any other quarter in that calendar year 
we license our technologies to independent software vendors that incorporate our technologies into software applications for computers and other consumer hardware devices 
an independent software vendor typically pays us an initial license fee  in addition to per unit royalties based on the number of products sold that include our technology 
we also license our technologies directly to consumers through several software bundles 
we make certain software bundles available free of charge from our website 
these bundles incorporate a version of our codec technology and allow consumers to play and create content in the divx format 
we also make available from our website an enhanced version of our free software bundles  including additional features that increase the quality and control of divx media playback and creation 
these enhanced versions are available free of charge for a limited trial period  which is generally days 
at the end of the trial period  our users are invited to purchase a license to one or more components of the enhanced bundle by making a one time payment to us 
if they choose not to do so  they still enjoy playback and creation functionality equivalent to our free software 
table of contents bundle 
we believe that downloads of this software benefit our business both directly and indirectly 
our business benefits directly from increased revenues when the user downloads a for pay version 
our business benefits indirectly when free or trial versions are downloaded  as we believe such downloads increase our installed base and therefore the demand for consumer hardware devices that contain our technologies 
we derive revenue from advertisements or third party software applications that we embed in or include with the software bundles we offer to consumers 
for example  from november through november we included and distributed the yahoo toolbar software product with our software products 
yahoo paid us fees based on the number of downloads or activations of the included software by consumers 
in november  yahoo notified us that they intended to breach the two year advertising services agreement and would discontinue making payments required under the agreement 
as a result  we have filed a lawsuit in california superior court seeking damages from yahoo and specific performance under the agreement 
revenue earned under this agreement accounted for approximately of our total net revenues in  during and through november  we had agreed with google to include and distribute the mozilla firefox browser and certain google software products with our software products 
google paid us fees based on the number of downloads or activations of the included software by consumers 
this agreement expired on november  payments earned under the google agreement accounted for approximately and of our total net revenues in the years and  respectively 
in addition  in march  we signed a multi year agreement with google inc to offer google products to consumers who download divx video software tools 
the offering  starting with the google chrome browser  is expected to launch in the first or second quarter of and replaces third party software previously distributed by divx 
we derive revenue by acting as an application service provider for third party owners of digital video content 
we provide encoding  content storage and distribution services to these third parties in exchange for a percentage of the revenue they receive from sales of digital content to consumers 
we also derive revenues by encoding third party content into the divx format to allow such content to be delivered more efficiently via the internet 
revenues for content distribution and other services have declined slightly for each of the last three years 
we record revenue related to content distribution arrangements with consumer hardware oems who pay us a fee for each copy of divx encoded content that is encoded on physical media and bundled with their consumer hardware products 
if our content licensing arrangements with consumer hardware oems or our online video community services are successful  our content distribution revenues may increase in future periods 
a small number of customers account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
in  yahoo and lg accounted for and  respectively  of our total net revenues 
in  google and lg accounted for and  respectively  of our total net revenues 
in  google and lg accounted for and  respectively  of our total net revenues 
we are a global company with a broad  geographically diverse market presence 
we have offices in eight foreign countries as well as sales staff in several others  and our hardware and software products are distributed in over countries and territories 
we have historically generated a substantial amount of our revenues from international sales  which have grown to represent an increasingly large percentage of our overall revenues 
for the years ended december   and  our revenues outside north america comprised  and  respectively  of our total net revenues 
a large portion of our total revenues come from licensing our technologies to consumer hardware device manufacturers  most of whom are located outside of north america 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of license fees payable to providers of intellectual property that is included in our technologies 
generally  royalties are due to our third party intellectual property providers based on when certain of our products are sold  subject to contractually agreed upon limits 
to a much lesser extent  cost of revenues also includes depreciation on certain computing equipment and related software  the compensation of related employees  internet connectivity costs  third party payment processing fees and 
table of contents allocable overhead 
although this may not be the case in the future  and although we have experienced some variability to our cost of revenue structure in the past  in general our costs of revenues have not been highly variable with revenue volumes 
as a result  we generally expect our overall gross margins to fluctuate with revenues 
selling  general and administrative the majority of selling  general and administrative expenses consists of employee compensation costs 
selling  general and administrative expense also includes marketing expenses  business travel costs  trade show costs  outside consulting fees and allocable overhead 
our headcount for selling  general  and administrative related personnel  including employees and outside contractors decreased by from as of december  to as of december   in part as a result of our shutdown of our online video community service  stage during the first quarter of if the need arises  we may hire additional employees or outside contractors for our selling  general and administrative staff as needed and may increase our selling  general and administrative budget to meet future needs 
product development the majority of product development expenses consist of employee compensation for personnel responsible for the development of new technologies and products 
our headcount for product development related personnel  including employees and outside contractors decreased by from as of december  to as of december   in part as a result of our shutdown of our online video community service  stage during the first quarter of product development expense also includes bandwidth expenses  depreciation of computer and related equipment  software license fees and allocable overhead 
we expect our product development expenses to remain relatively consistent with while we may hire additional employees to meet our business needs  if permanent employees are not available for hire  we may use outside contractors to fulfill our labor needs when and as required to accomplish our operating goals 
impairment of acquired intangibles during  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the patented technology license intangible asset acquired in connection with our acquisition of veatros  llc  a limited liability company  in july  and an impairment charge of approximately  related to the mainconcept tradename  which was acquired in connection with our acquisition of mainconcept in november as more fully discussed in note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  management performed an impairment analysis of the patented technology intangible asset in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and of the mainconcept tradename in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and recorded impairment charges of million and  respectively as management concluded that the assets were not fully recoverable 
asset impairment and restructuring on february   we shut down stage  our online video community service 
we evaluated the long lived assets associated with stage for impairment and concluded that the carrying amount of certain computers and computer equipment  prepaid assets and an intangible asset were not recoverable and an impairment loss equal to the assets remaining carrying values of approximately  was recorded 
in addition  we identified several contractual obligations associated with stage that were determined to have no future economic value 
as a result  we recorded a loss of  on those contractual obligations during opportunities  challenges and risks our technology licensing revenues from consumer hardware device manufacturers have been primarily dependent upon our licensees sales of dvd players that incorporate our technologies 
revenue from technology 
table of contents licensing to consumer hardware device manufacturers increased by from to  and by from to we do not expect our revenue growth rates attributable to dvd player sales to remain as high as they have been in recent years as the markets for dvd players mature 
because our technologies are embedded in dvd players  our licensing revenue is subject to fluctuations based on consumer demand for these products 
we actively promote the incorporation of our video compression technologies for use in other consumer products such as digital televisions  mobile phone  portable media players and dvd recorders  but there is no assurance we will receive material royalties on sales of these products in the future 
if sales of dvd players that incorporate our technologies do not continue to grow  or if our technologies are displaced from these devices by competing technologies  our revenue would be adversely affected 
historically  the increases in our technology licensing revenues have been driven by increases in the volume of sales of products incorporating our technologies 
however  this increase in revenues has been partially offset by declines in the per unit royalty we derive  which has resulted from a combination of volume based price discounts and overall pricing pressure on established technology royalties in the market 
we believe that if our technology achieves market acceptance as a de facto standard  volumes will continue to increase unless and until our technology fully penetrates the market 
to the extent such market acceptance and volume increases occur  we believe that average selling prices of our existing technologies will decline 
we may not be able to successfully introduce newer technologies with higher average selling prices into the market to offset any such decline 
one or a small number of our licensees generally represents a significant percentage of our technology licensing revenues 
for example  in the years and  lg accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total net revenues 
a reduction in these sales or a loss of one or more of our key licensees would adversely affect our licensing revenues 
as technologies for dvd players and other consumer hardware devices with video compression capabilities evolve  we must continue to design and deliver innovative technologies that are sought by manufacturers and consumers alike 
part of our strategy is to have our digital media technologies adopted as de facto industry standards for use in consumer hardware devices 
generally  for a technology to become an industry standard  the royalty rates must not be prohibitively costly as compared to other potential alternatives 
as a result  the royalty rates we charge for our technologies will likely be lower than the royalty rates received for technologies not adopted as industry standards  and our long term ability to raise royalty rates for our technologies could be limited by this trend 
during and  a significant portion of our revenues was generated from our agreement with google 
in november of  our agreement with google expired 
revenues under the google software distribution and promotion agreement represented approximately and of our total net revenues in the years and  respectively 
in september  we entered into a two year global agreement with yahoo to offer consumers who download divx video software tools a co branded version of the yahoo toolbar and internet explorer optimized for yahoo 
through mid november  yahoo paid us fees based on the number of certain distributions or installations of the yahoo software by consumers under an agreement that expires on december  in november  yahoo notified us that they intended to breach this two year advertising services agreement and would discontinue making payments required under the agreement 
as a result  we have filed a lawsuit in california superior court seeking damages from yahoo and specific performance under the agreement 
revenues earned under the yahoo agreement accounted for of our total net revenue in the year of in march  we signed a multi year agreement with google inc to offer google products to consumers who download divx video software tools 
the offering  starting with the google chrome browser  is expected to launch in the first or second quarter of and replaces third party software previously distributed by divx 
however  this deal may not generate the same amount of revenue as we received pursuant to our prior agreement with yahoo 

table of contents acquisitions in may  we made an equity investment in deviantart  inc  or deviantart  a private corporation that aggregates and distributes art via its web community and facilitates an open forum where artists can exhibit their artwork and build community around that art in an effort to drive commerce 
our investment consisted of million cash for which we received certain shares of deviantart s series a preferred stock 
as further consideration for our investment  we entered into an advertising and marketing agreement with deviantart 
we have allocated approximately  of the investment to the advertising and marketing agreement  based on its estimated fair value  and the remaining million is being carried as an investment 
the value allocated to the advertising and marketing agreement is being amortized ratably over the period in which the services are being rendered october through march as our ownership is less than of deviantart and we have no influence over its performance  the investment has been accounted for using the cost basis  and is periodically reviewed for impairment 
no such impairment has occurred to date 
the investment and the long term portion of the advertising and marketing agreement are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
the current portion of the advertising and marketing agreement is included in prepaid expenses on the consolidated balance sheets 
in july  we acquired all of the assets of veatros  llc  or veatros  a limited liability company engaged in real time digital video processing for the purposes of producing enhanced video search and discovery services 
at the time of acquisition  the operations of veatros had been wound down and no development projects were in process 
the acquisition was accounted for as an acquisition of assets in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
the total purchase price for the acquisition is up to million comprised of an initial upfront cash payment of million  which we made in july  and subsequent cash payments up to million upon the achievement of certain technology related milestones 
we did not acquire any tangible assets or assume any liabilities as a result of the acquisition 
we allocated cash payments of million to the one identifiable intangible asset  a patented technology license 
the asset is being amortized over the remaining life of the patented technology license  or approximately years 
in july  subsequent to the asset purchase  our board of directors approved a plan to separate our stage operations into a separate private entity  and during the three months ended march   stage was shut down 
as a significant portion of the benefit from the acquired patented technology license was originally ascribed to stage future activities  we evaluated the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with statement of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets based on the projected benefits solely attributable to our core consumer electronics business 
based on our revised forecasts excluding the stage future activities and discounting the cash flows attributable to our core consumer electronics business  we concluded that the carrying amount of the asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment charge of approximately million was recorded in in the consolidated statements of income for the initial up front cash payment and for the technology milestone 
during  technology milestones equal to million in the aggregate were achieved 
as these technology milestones were attributable to stage  the milestones were not considered to be recoverable and as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the consolidated statements of income during all milestones had been achieved and the remaining milestone payment of  was paid during as of december   the company has no remaining liability related to the acquisition of veatros 
in november  we acquired all outstanding shares of mainconcept s capital stock for approximately million 
the total purchase price  including acquisition costs of  was million in cash   shares of our common stock  which were valued at approximately million as of the date of the transaction  and outstanding loans extended to mainconcept by one of its shareholders that we also purchased for an aggregate of approximately million 
in addition  the purchase agreement provides for additional payments of up to approximately million upon the achievement by mainconcept of certain product development goals and certain financial milestones 
during  million in milestones were recorded as additional purchase price and allocated to goodwill  which is deductible for us tax purposes 
the acquired goodwill will not be amortized for financial reporting purposes  but will be assessed periodically for impairment 

table of contents critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to use accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from the judgments and estimates we have employed reporting our financial positions and results  our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected 
revenue recognition we evaluate revenue recognition for transactions to sell products and services and to license technology using the criteria set forth by the securities exchange commission in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab no 
sab no 
states that revenue is recognized when each of the following criteria is met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among separate elements based on their relative fair values  provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
our licensing revenue is primarily derived from royalties and or license fees paid to us by licensees of our intellectual property rights 
revenue in such transactions is recognized during the period in which such customers report to us the number of royalty eligible units that they have shipped 
revenue from guaranteed minimum royalty licenses is recognizable upon delivery of the technology license when no further obligations of the company exist 
certain of our license agreements provide for royalties based on our estimations of the volumes of certain units consumer hardware device manufacturers are estimated to ship during a given term for which we recognize revenue over the term of the contractual agreement 
in certain guaranteed minimum royalty licenses and license agreements based on volume estimates  we enter into extended payment programs with customers 
revenue related to such extended payment programs is recognized at the earlier of when cash is received or when periodic payments become due to us 
if we receive non refundable advance payments from licensees that are allocable to future contract period or could be creditable against other obligations of the licensee to us  the recognition of the related revenue is deferred until such future period or creditable obligation lapses 
royalties and other license fees are recorded net of reserves for estimated losses  and are recognized when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we make judgments as to whether collectibility can be reasonably assured based on the licensee s recent payment history unless significant and persuasive evidence exists that the customer is creditworthy 
in the absence of a favorable collection history or significant and persuasive evidence that the customer is creditworthy  we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

table of contents we have entered into a contractual relationship to license technology to a customer and we also obtained format approval for which we provided consideration to a related customer 
in situations where we do not receive an identifiable benefit that is sufficiently separable from our customers purchase of our products or where we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the products or services we are purchasing  we record the consideration provided to our customers as an offset to revenues in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
we have contracts with original equipment manufacturers  original design manufacturers  integrated circuit manufacturers  independent software vendors  advertisers and content providers 
our revenue recognition policies for each of these arrangements are summarized below 
technology licensing to original equipment manufacturers 
we license our technologies to original equipment manufacturers of consumer hardware devices  and in return each original equipment manufacturer typically pays us a royalty for each divx certified unit the customer ships 
royalty revenue is recognized in the period in which we receive competent evidential matter that revenue has been earned in the form of a shipment report from the customer 
if we receive pre certification license fees from a customer  recognition of this revenue is deferred in its entirety until we certify the original equipment manufacturer s product in accordance with our certification guidelines 
if we receive nonrefundable minimum commitments from a customer that are also not allocable to a future contract period  we will recognize the full amount upon billing if collectibility is assured based on recent payment history  but only if we have no further obligation to provide post contract support 
if we have future support obligations pertaining to minimum commitment agreements  we recognize licensing fees ratably over the length of the agreement because vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for the unlimited upgrades and support included in the contract 
technology licensing to integrated circuit manufacturers 
we license our technologies to integrated circuit manufacturers and provide support and unlimited upgrades during the contract term so they can incorporate our technologies into the chips they manufacture for consumer hardware devices 
the initial license fee is deferred in total until we certify the integrated circuit manufacturer s product in accordance with our certification guidelines 
because vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for the service elements  after certification  we recognize the license fee ratably over the remaining length of the associated contract  which is typically two to three years 
technology licensing to original design manufacturers 
we license our technology to original design manufacturer customers and partners who manufacture devices such as dvd players  digital televisions  mobile phones  and other consumer hardware devices 
recognition of the related licensing fees is deferred in total until we certify the original design manufacturer s product in accordance with our certification guidelines  after which we have no further performance obligation 
technology licensing for software to independent software vendors 
we license our technologies for resale to independent software vendors and in return the software vendor pays us a royalty for each unit shipped that incorporates our technologies 
revenue is recognized in the period in which we receive competent evidential matter that revenue has been earned in the form of a shipment report from the customer 
in addition  in some cases we receive an initial license fee for our software and agree to provide post contract upgrades and support 
in these cases  we recognize revenues ratably over the length of the contract  as vendor specific objective evidence typically does not exist for the upgrades and support period implied by the contract 
technology licensing for software to consumers 
we license our technologies to consumers via our website for a fixed fee per download 
the license includes upgrades and support until such time as a new pay version becomes available  which is generally referred to as a left of decimal upgrade 
payment is made online with a credit card via a third party payment service provider  who in turn remits aggregate payments to us on a monthly basis 
we recognize these revenues ratably over the period ending at the next expected left of decimal upgrade  which is typically months from the time of the last upgrade  as vendor specific objective evidence typically does not exist for the upgrades and support under such licensing agreements 

table of contents advertising and third party product distribution 
we are paid by third party software companies for distributing their software when such software is downloaded or installed via our website  typically within our own software download products 
the related distribution fees are recognized based on the number of downloads and activations 
we recognize these fees upon receiving competent evidential documentation from our reporting systems 
content distribution services 
we make available our online video delivery system to content customers in return for a revenue share of the download for rental revenue generated by the content provider customer using our delivery system 
the content partner delivers a video on demand movie through its website using our open video system 
the end customer purchasing such content must pay by credit card before being allowed to download the movie 
we earn a certain percentage of each sale based on a pre negotiated revenue share with the content provider customer 
revenue is recognized monthly based on sales reports  net of any returns or charge backs as reconciled by us and the content provider customer 
encoding services 
we encode the content of certain customers into the divx format and charge these customers for this service 
in some cases revenue is recognized in full after the encoding service is performed if the customer agrees to provide a deposit in full 
in other cases revenue is recognized and invoiced based on a calculation of value per unit of divx encoded content that is downloaded from a content provider s site 
we record revenue net of allowances for uncollectible sales 
revenue is recorded net of allowances for uncollectible sales 
we continually monitor customer payment performance and maintain a reserve for estimated amounts that may be uncollectible 
in determining our reserve  we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a variety of factors 
generally  in cases where the customer is new and has an undemonstrated ability to pay  we delay recognition of the revenue until such time as the new customer has paid unless significant and persuasive evidence exists that the customer is creditworthy 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  despite the customer s payment history  we record a specific allowance against amounts due and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably believed to be collectible 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for uncollectible sales based on our actual historical write off experience in conjunction with the length of time the receivables are past due  customer creditworthiness  geographic risk and the current business environment 
actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and may materially affect our consolidated statements of income and our financial condition 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our financial statements we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect our accounting for income taxes 
this process includes estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences  including differences in the timing of recognition of share based compensation expense  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe recovery is not more likely than not  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially impacted if actual results significantly differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  and related guidance  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or 
table of contents litigation processes  if any 
if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit  then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effective settlement of audit issues  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted sfas  no 
 fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb  issued a staff position that delays the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for those recognized or disclosed at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 or fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
fsp clarifies the application of sfas no 
in a market that is not active and addresses application issues such as the use of internal assumptions when relevant observable data does not exist  the use of observable market information when the market is not active and the use of market quotes when assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data 
fsp is effective for all periods presented in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas no 
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measure date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
all of the securities classified as level instruments are municipal bonds with an auction reset feature  or ars  whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
as of december   we held million par value ars  all of which experienced failed auctions during the year 
the underlying assets of the securities consisted of student loans and municipal bonds  of which million were guaranteed by the us government and the remaining million were privately insured 
all of these ars had credit ratings of aaa  the highest rating  except for one which is a  by a rating agency  and contractual maturity dates ranging from to and were classified as long term investments as of december  the significant inputs and assumptions we used in the discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of its ars  as of december   were as follows the discount rate was determined based on the average three month libor during the fourth quarter of  adjusted by basis points bps to reflect the current market conditions for 
table of contents instruments with similar credit quality at the date of valuation 
in addition  the discount rate was adjusted for a liquidity discount of bps to reflect the market risk for these investments that has arisen due to the lack of an active market 
we assigned an additional credit risk discount of bps to the discount rate for all ars that are not fully backed by the federal government 
the total carrying value as of december  of investments not fully backed by the federal government was approximately million 
we applied the discount rate over the expected life of years of the estimated cash flows of the ars 
the projected interest income is based on the future contractual rates set forth in the individual prospectus for each of the ars 
in november  we entered into an agreement with ubs ag  or ubs  which provides us certain rights to sell to ubs the ars which were purchased through them 
as of december   we held million par value ars purchased from ubs 
we have the option to sell these securities to ubs at par value from june  through july  ubs  at its discretion  may purchase or sell these securities on our behalf at any time provided we receive par value for the securities sold 
the issuers of the ars continue to have the right to redeem the securities at their discretion 
the agreement allows for the continuation of the accrual and payment of interest due on the securities 
the agreement also provides us with access to loans of up to of the par value of the unredeemed securities until june  these loans would carry interest rates which would be consistent with the interest income on the related auction rate securities 
as of december   we have no loans outstanding under this agreement 
our right to sell the ars to ubs commencing june  represents a put option for a payment equal to the par value of the ars 
as the put option is non transferable and cannot be attached to the ars if they are sold to another entity other than ubs  it represents a freestanding instrument 
we elected the fair value option under fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities  and recorded the put option in long term investments in the consolidated balance sheets 
during  we recorded a gain of million representing i the initial fair value of the put option  and ii the changes in the fair value of the put option from november  the election date  to the end of the year 
we recorded a loss of million representing i the transfer of the ubs ars from available for sale to trading securities and  accordingly  recognizing the unrealized losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in earnings at the election date  and ii the subsequent changes in fair value from the election date to the end of the year 
the transfer from available for sale to trading securities was a one time election as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
both the gain from recording the put option at fair value and the loss due to the transfer from available for sale to trading securities  as well as subsequent fair value adjustments  were recorded in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
we believe that subsequent changes in the value of the put option will largely offset the subsequent fair value movements of the ars  subject to the continued expected performance by the financial institution of its obligations under the agreement 
our significant inputs and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the put option  as of december   are as follows the discount rate was determined based on the month libor  adjusted by basis points bps to reflect the credit and performance risk associated with the ubs put option 
we applied the discount rate over the expected life of months of the estimated cash flows of the put option 
the projected interest income is based on the future contractual rates set forth in the individual prospectus for each of the ars that is included in the put option 
the remaining million par value ars is held by another investment advisor  who has not made an offer similar to ubs and we continue to classify those ars as available for sale securities 
accordingly  the change in associated market value has been recorded against accumulated other comprehensive loss income as of 
table of contents december  if the market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss income or record an other than temporary impairment charge in the consolidated statements of income 
we may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security  a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the security matures 
share based compensation we account for share based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to all share based payments including stock options 
pursuant to sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under employee share based compensation plans 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of sfas r but the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to estimate a variety of factors  including the expected term of the option  the volatility of our common stock  the applicable risk free rate  dividend yield and the forfeiture rate 
the expected term used represents the weighted average period that the stock options are expected to be outstanding 
we use the historical volatility of our common stock as well as the historical volatility of a comparable peer group to derive the expected volatility of our common stock 
the peer group historical volatility is used due to the limited trading history of our common stock 
we use a risk free interest rate that is based on the implied yield available on us treasury issued with an equivalent remaining term at the time of grant 
we have not paid dividends in the past and currently do not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future and as such  dividend yield is assumed to be zero for the purposes of valuing the stock options granted 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  share based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
when there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees  our share based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants 
sfas no 
r also requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits due to tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
for non employees  we account for share based compensation in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting recognition for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods for services 
equity instruments awarded to non employees are periodically remeasured as the underlying awards vest unless the instruments are fully vested  immediately exercisable and nonforfeitable on date of grant 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are recorded at the estimated fair value of the assets acquired 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised of purchased customer relationships  trademarks and trade names  developed technologies and other intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from two to eight years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but tested annually for impairment or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
if we determine that the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite  that asset will be tested for impairment in the same manner as other indefinite lived intangible assets 
the intangible asset  after recognition of any impairment  would then be amortized over its estimated useful life and accounted for prospectively in the same manner as other intangible assets with finite lives 
the performance of the impairment test of goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step involves measuring the impairment by comparing the implied fair values of the affected reporting unit s goodwill and intangible assets with the respective carrying values 
the performance of the impairment test of intangible assets with indefinite lives involves assessing the fair value of such intangible assets as of the assessment date  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of these assets 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of these assets  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and fair value 
we performed annual impairment assessment of the carrying value of goodwill as required under sfas no 
as of october  at october   we had one reporting unit as determined and identified in accordance with sfas no 
we compared the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value in accordance with sfas no 
we estimated the fair value of our reporting unit using both the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method  and the market approach which utilizes market multiples and other company specific data to estimate the fair value 
the discounted cash flows for the reporting unit were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for the identified reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates 
future cash flows were discounted to present value by incorporating the present value techniques discussed in fasb concepts statement  using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements  or concepts statement specifically  the income approach valuations included reporting unit cash flow discount rates ranging from to  and terminal value growth rates ranging from to 
publicly available information regarding our market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair value of our reporting unit estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology 
to validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair value  we reconciled the aggregated fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one of the goodwill impairment test to the market capitalization of our stock to derive the implied control premium 
in performing this reconciliation  we used an average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date  generally days 
we assess the implied control premium to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit estimated in step one of the goodwill impairment test is reasonable 
upon completion of the october annual impairment assessment  we determined no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
however  a decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting unit at october  would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
purchased intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of mainconcept in november  we identified the mainconcept tradename as an intangible asset with an indefinite life  and valued the tradename at million 
due to the change in the foreign exchange rates  at december   the tradename had a carrying value of million 
we also performed an annual impairment assessment of the carrying value of the mainconcept tradename as 
table of contents required under sfas no 
as of october  in accordance with sfas no 
 we assessed the fair value of the tradename and compared the fair value to its carrying value 
we estimated the fair value of the tradename using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method  based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes and incorporates a terminal value calculation for years beyond the internal forecasts 
future cash flows were also discounted to present value by incorporating the present value techniques discussed in concepts statement specifically  the income approach valuation used a cash flow discount rate of and a terminal value growth rate of 
upon completion of our annual impairment assessment  we determined that the carrying value of the mainconcept tradename exceeded its fair value  and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  in the consolidated statements of income of in addition  as of december   the company determined that the life of the tradename was no longer indefinite and will amortize the tradename prospectively over its estimated useful life of years 
long lived assets  including as intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assesses the value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate  and recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the assets  plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the assets if any  are less than the carrying value of the assets 
when an impairment is identified  we reduce the carrying amount of the assets to estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or  when available and appropriate  comparable market values

table of contents revenue received from google in as compared to for use of our technology 
the balance of the increase is due to an increase in revenues from software products sold directly to consumers 
advertising and third party product distribution the  or  increase in advertising and third party product distribution revenue from the year ended december  to the year ended december  resulted primarily from an increase in revenues associated with our software redistribution license agreement with yahoo compared to our agreement with google in in november  we switched from distribution of the google software  to instead including and distributing a co branded yahoo toolbar and internet explorer browser with our software products under agreement with yahoo 
pursuant to the agreement  yahoo paid us fees based on the number of certain distributions or installations of the yahoo software by consumers 
in november  yahoo notified us that they intended to breach this two year advertising services agreement and would discontinue making payments required under the agreement 
as a result  we have filed a lawsuit in california superior court seeking damages from yahoo and specific performance under the agreement 
the million  or  increase in advertising and third party product distribution revenue from the year ended december  to the year ended december  resulted primarily from an increase in revenues associated with our distribution of google s software under our software distribution and promotion agreement with google

table of contents technology licensing the increase in overall gross profit  in terms of absolute dollars  across all periods presented was due primarily to increased royalties from technology licensing to consumer hardware device manufacturers without a corresponding increase in royalty expenses due to our licensors 
advertising and third party product distribution our cost of advertising and product distribution revenue has remained relatively fixed as a percentage of such revenue because the cost of bandwidth associated with product downloads is directly proportional to the volume of downloads 
content distribution and related services the increase in gross profit from our content distribution and related services from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was primarily due to certain costs related to the stage service which were incurred during  but no longer incurred after we shut down stage on february  the decrease in gross profit  in terms of absolute dollars  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was primarily due to decreased revenues over a relatively fixed cost base

the million  or  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was principally due to a million increase in costs resulting from increased average headcount  predominantly in the sales and marketing functions 
costs associated with these headcount increases were comprised of salaries and benefits  performance based compensation  share based compensation  travel costs and recruiting fees 
in addition  we experienced a million increase in internet connectivity related costs primarily associated with stage  a million increase in professional services  particularly legal and accounting services associated with being a publicly traded company and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  an increase in depreciation expense of million  an increase in facility overhead costs of approximately million and a million increase in marketing costs  particularly tradeshow  advertising and content and branding expenses  and approximately  of patent royalty expense

 and concluded that the assets were not fully recoverable 
interest income expense  net we recorded interest income expense  net of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average cash and equivalents  and investment balances during the lower average cash balances primarily resulted from cash used to acquire mainconcept in november and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in  compared to the same period in the prior year 
we recorded interest income expense  net of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is reflective of higher average cash balances  which principally resulted from proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in our initial public offering in september  as well as an increase in the average yields realized on our cash and equivalents  and investment balances 
other income expense  net we recorded other expenses totaling approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to other income of  for the year ended december  the fluctuations in other income expenses  net were primarily due to foreign exchange losses on our euro based intercompany receivable balance which resulted from our acquisition of mainconcept

the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable was determined based on i taxable income in prior carry back years  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  iii tax planning strategies  and iv future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  the income tax benefit recorded during was primarily due to the removal of a reserve on our us deferred tax assets related to our nol carryforwards and certain research and development credits of approximately million  a reduction in our fin liability of approximately million related to the removal of our reserve for research and development credits established as a result of the implementation of fin  and a reduction in the valuation allowance related to our foreign tax credits of approximately million

in addition  based on the weight of available evidence  including cumulative profitability in recent years  we determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of our us deferred tax assets would be realized and  as of december   eliminated million of our valuation allowance associated with our us deferred tax assets 
the elimination of our valuation allowance resulted in a million benefit recognized as a non cash increase in earnings for the year ended december  after we completed our research and development credit documentation process  we determined that it was more likely than not that approximately million of the fin liability should be reversed and we recorded a reduction to our fin accrual of million and a corresponding decrease in current income tax provision 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately  excluding the tax benefits described above 
the difference between the federal and state statutory combined rate of and our effective tax rate for is due to the impact of accounting for share based compensation related to certain share based awards  and mainconcept acquisition costs  which are treated as permanent differences 
in addition  the company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset generated by mainconcept due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to utilize this asset 
liquidity and capital resources our financial position included cash  cash equivalents and investments of million and million at december  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the current turbulence in the us and global financial markets has caused a decline in stock values across all industries 
we are exposed to market risk primarily in the area of changes in united states interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
we have not used derivative financial or commodity instruments or engaged in hedging activities 

table of contents interest rate risk all of our fixed income investments are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at market value 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and investments are subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our investment portfolio to changes in interest rates 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
we have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities that attempt to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of interest rate trends 
we generally do not utilize derivatives to hedge against increases in interest rates which decrease market values 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  all of which are stated at fair value 
changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of million of our cash and cash equivalents at december   as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months 
the weighted average maturity of our investments excluding auction rate securities as of december  was approximately four months 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates over a four month period for those in effect at december  would  however  decrease or increase  respectively  the remaining million of our investments by approximately  while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our consolidated statements of income until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
at december   we held approximately million of municipal bond investments  classified as long term assets  with an auction reset feature  or auction rate securities  or ars  whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and the company will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the investments mature  which may be over years 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
all ars are currently aaa rated  the highest rating  except for one which is a rated  by a rating agency 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
at december   we utilized a discounted cash flow approach to arrive at a valuation of million based on level inputs for ars investments  which represents a decline in value of million from par 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of  based on data available as of december   interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  thereby could result in significant changes to the fair value of ars 
in november  we accepted an offer  or the right  from ubs ag  or ubs  entitling us to sell at par value ars originally purchased from ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  in accepting the right  we granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ars at par at any time up until the expiration date of the offer and released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of ars 
although we expect to sell our ars under the right  if the right is not exercised before july  it will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
in lieu of our acceptance of the right  ars will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the ars if the auction process fails 
the value of the right may largely offset the decline in fair value of the ars 
ubs s obligations under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continues to fail  then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk mainconcept generates revenues and incurs costs which are denominated in local currencies 
as exchange rates vary  these results when translated into us dollars may vary from expectations and may adversely impact overall expected results 
additionally  at december   we had a receivable balance denominated in euros due from mainconcept 
our outstanding receivable balance is translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of other income expense  net 
a basis point increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates over a three month period from those in effect at december  would not materially impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
during the year ended december   we recorded  of foreign currency losses related to our foreign currency receivable denominated in euros in other income expense  net on our consolidated statements of income
