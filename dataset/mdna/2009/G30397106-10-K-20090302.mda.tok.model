item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note reinsurance in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
catastrophe risk management to achieve our catastrophe risk management objectives  we utilize a variety of proprietary and commercially available tools to quantify and monitor the various risks we accept as a company 
we have licensed catastrophe modeling software from the principal modeling firms  including eqe  rms and air 
these software tools use exposure data provided by our insureds and ceding company clients to simulate catastrophic losses 
we take an active role in the evaluation of these commercial catastrophe models  providing feedback to the modeling companies to improve the efficiencies of these models 
we also supplement the model output in certain territories with the results of our proprietary models 
we use modeling not just for the underwriting of individual transactions but also to optimize the total return and risk of our underwriting portfolio 
we have high standards for the quality and level of detailed exposure data provided by our clients and have an expressed preference for data at the zip code or postal code level or finer 
data provided at more summary levels  such as counties or cresta zones  is conservatively modeled and surcharged for increased uncertainty 
we require significant amounts of data from our clients and decline business in which we feel the data provided is insufficient to make an appropriate analysis 
our commitment to detailed exposure data precludes significant involvement as a retrocessionaire in the current market 
data output from the software described above is incorporated in our proprietary models 
our proprietary systems include those for modeling risks associated with property catastrophe  healthcare liability  aviation  agriculture  property and workers compensation business  various casualty and specialty pricing models as well as our proprietary portfolio risk management and capital allocation models 
these systems allow us to monitor our pricing and risk on a contract by contract basis in each of our segments and business lines 
data output from both our licensed and proprietary software models is used to estimate the amount of premium that is required to pay the long term expected losses under the proposed contracts 
the data output is also used to estimate correlation among both new business and our existing portfolio 
the degree of correlation is used to estimate the incremental capital required to support our participation on each proposed risk  allowing us to calculate a return on consumed capital 
finally  the data output is used to monitor and control our cumulative exposure to individual perils across all of our businesses 
our pricing of catastrophe reinsurance contracts is based on a combination of modeled loss estimates  actual ceding company loss history  surcharges for potential unmodeled exposures  fixed and variable expense estimates and profit requirements 
the profit requirements are based on incremental capital usage estimates described above and on our required return on consumed capital 
loss reserving risk management establishing reserves for losses and loss expenses  in particular reserves for the company s long tail lines of business  constitutes a significant risk for the company 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead are estimates of what the company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
to the extent the company determines that actual losses and loss expenses exceed the loss reserves recorded in our financial statements  the company will be required to immediately increase its reserve for losses and loss expenses which in turn could cause a material reduction in the company s profitability and capital 
the company manages the risk inherent in estimating the company s reserves for losses and loss expenses in a variety of ways 
first  the company underwrites a balanced and diversified portfolio of business  which reduces the company s susceptibility to reserving errors that may be associated with any one line or type of business 
in  the company s largest single line of business represented of the gross premiums written by the company 
second  where loss development uncertainty exists  the company makes select use of the purchase of reinsurance to reduce the company s exposure to such loss development uncertainty  in particular in our insurance lines of business 
third  the company incorporates uncertainty in loss trends into its underwriting pricing process 
fourth  in its reinsurance business  the company conducts active  regular audits of its ceding company clients with the intent of identifying quickly and thoroughly exposures assumed by the company 
the company s reserving process also serves to mitigate the risk associated with the company s loss and loss reserve estimates 
the company seeks to base its loss reserve estimates upon actuarial and statistical projections derived from the most recently available data  as well as current information on future trends in claims severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
the company refines continually both its loss reserve estimates and the means by which its loss reserve estimates are derived  incorporating an ongoing process of developing loss experience  reported claims and claims settlements 
investment risk management investment risk encompasses the risk of loss in our investment portfolio as a result of market risks  as well as risks inherent in individual securities 
market risks represent the adverse impact on our invested assets from fluctuations in interest rates  equity prices  credit spreads  foreign currency rates and other market prices 
the company manages its investment risks through both structural and procedural strategies 
to ensure diversification of the company s investment portfolio and avoid aggregation of risks  limits on asset types  economic sector exposure  industry exposure and individual security exposure are placed on our investment portfolio  and monitored on an ongoing basis 
the company manages its interest rate risk through an asset liability strategy that involves the selection of investments with appropriate characteristics  such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that are tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our liabilities 
the company manages foreign currency risk by seeking to match the company s liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with assets including cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies 
in order to limit the company s exposure to credit risk  the company s investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
the company has limited its exposure to any single corporate issuer to or less of its fixed income portfolio  which includes fixed maturity investment  short term investments and preferred equity securities  as of december  the company uses a number of capital at risk models  which include volatility scenario based measures and value at risk var calculations to evaluate its investment portfolio risk 
volatility scenario based measures are used in order to stress test the portfolio for expected changes in specific market scenarios 
var is a probabilistic method of measuring the potential loss in portfolio value over a given time period and for a given distribution of historical returns 
portfolio risk  as measured by var  is affected by four primary risk factors asset concentration  asset volatility  asset correlation and systematic risk 
for a one year period over of the time  assuming the risks taken into account in the var model perform per their historical tendencies  the investment portfolio loss for this year period is expected to be less than or equal to at december  the company adjusts its scenarios for a variety of extremes as well as expected outcomes 
management continuously evaluates the applicability and relevance of the models used and makes adjustments as necessary to reflect actual market conditions and performance over time 
operational risk management operational risk represents the risk of loss as a result of inadequate or failed internal processes  system failures  human error or external events 
operational risks include  for example  employee or third party fraud  business interruptions  inaccurate processing of transactions  information technology failures  the loss of key employees without appropriate successors  and non compliance with reporting obligations 
the company seeks to mitigate operational risks through the application of strong process controls throughout our business 
key process controls include underwriting authority letters  underwriting referral protocols  claims procedures guidelines  sarbanes oxley procedures  information technology procedures  the disaster recovery plan and the business continuity plan 
the company s internal audit personnel  sarbanes oxley personnel and operational audit personnel rigorously test the company s various process controls on a regular basis 
the use by the company of the services of unaffiliated third parties exposes the company to heightened operational risks  including the risk of information technology and physical security breaches  fraud  non compliance with laws and regulations or internal guidelines and inadequate service 
the company mitigates against the operational risk posed by the use of third party vendors by verifying a potential third party vendor s financial stability  ability to provide ongoing service  business continuity planning and its business reputation 
the company also allocates appropriate resources to monitor any significant third party relationships 
investments we follow an investment strategy designed to preserve book value growth and generate appropriate risk adjusted returns while providing sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the company 
the portfolio is designed to diversify risks  including interest rate  credit and structure risks 
our investment portfolio is managed by our chief investment officer and a team of investment professionals 
our investment team is experienced in direct portfolio management  asset allocation  managing external investment manager relationships  risk management and auditing and accounting 
our investment team uses risk measurement tools in executing effective risk management to facilitate an opportunity focused and risk integrated approach to investing consistent with the requirements of the company s investment policy 
we utilize external portfolio managers to oversee most of the day to day activities of our investment portfolio  and our investment professionals actively monitor our investment managers performance within the established investment policy of the company 
our investment policy establishes authority for our investment activities and specifies risk tolerances and minimum criteria on the overall credit quality and liquidity characteristics of the portfolio 
this includes limitations on the size of certain holdings as well as restrictions on purchasing certain types of securities or investing in certain industries 
our investment managers may be instructed to invest some of the investment portfolio in currencies other than us dollars based upon the business we have written  the currency in which our loss reserves are denominated or regulatory requirements 
our investment policy incorporates a traditional policy limit approach to each type of risk  thus setting a maximum amount of capital that may be exposed at any one time to particular types of securities and investment vehicles 
we develop and maintain an investment risk budget  which estimates the maximum and expected levels of risk relative to the company s shareholders equity that will be taken over a specified period 
in determining our investment decisions  we consider the impact of various catastrophic events on our invested assets  particularly those to which our insurance and reinsurance portfolio may also be exposed  in order to protect our financial position 
the investment risk budget is approved by the investment committee of the company s board of directors and is revised quarterly based on market conditions and developing needs of the company 
in addition  as part of our risk management processes  we maintain a watch list of securities that management considers to be at risk due to industry and or company specific issues and or securities potentially subject to future impairments 
these securities are subjected to further internal analysis to evaluate their underlying structures  credit characteristics and overall industry and security specific fundamentals until they are sold  mature or it is deemed that further review is no longer necessary 
we utilize a number of capital at risk models  which include volatility scenario based measures and value at risk calculations  to manage our aggregate investment risk exposures 
our capital at risk models also include the assessment of risk capital undertaken by standard poor s s p and am best and company 
volatility scenario based measures are used in order to stress test the portfolio for expected changes in specific market scenarios 
we adjust our scenarios for a variety of extreme as well as expected outcomes 
management continuously evaluates the applicability and relevance of the models used and makes adjustments as necessary to reflect actual market conditions and performance over time 
in addition  management and the board of directors regularly reviews investment strategy allocations  risk and capital allocations  expected returns and expected return on capital

as of december   our million of other investments consisted of million of alternative investment funds and million of high yield loan funds 
our investment in such funds is recorded on our balance sheet as other investments and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
adjustments to the carrying value of these investments are made based upon the net valuation criteria established by the managers of the funds  which in turn are established based upon the valuation criteria in the governing documents of the funds 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had liquid markets existed for the shares or partnership interests of the funds 
due to a delay in the valuations reported by certain of the fund managers  our investments in certain alternative funds are estimated based on the most recently available information including period end valuation statements  period end estimates  or  in some cases  prior month or quarter valuation statements 
prior to  all of our investments in alternative funds were generally reported on a one month lag 
investments in high yield loan funds are reported as of the current date 
many of the funds are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sale which are determined by the governing documents and thereby limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term

the investments purchased with the cash collateral had an average credit quality rating of aa by moody s and aa by standard poor s 
all securities on loan are issued on a term or overnight basis and are subject to daily recall at the company s discretion 
ratings ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
during  s p undertook a review of our ratings and reaffirmed the financial strength rating of a strong  with a stable outlook 
endurance holdings and its operating subsidiaries  excluding armtech  maintain an a 
m best rating of a excellent with a stable outlook 
during  am best undertook a review of armtech and upgraded its rating to a excellent from b good  with a stable outlook 
endurance holdings and its operating subsidiaries  excluding armtech  maintain a moody s rating of a  with a stable outlook 
the objective of am best s  moody s and s p s rating systems is to provide an opinion of an insurer s or reinsurer s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders 
these ratings reflect am best s  moody s and s p s opinions of our capitalization  performance and management  and are not applicable to our securities and are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold such securities 
am best maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from a superior to f in liquidation  and includes separate ratings categories 
within these categories  a superior and a superior are the highest  followed by a excellent and a excellent 
publications of am best indicate that the a and a ratings are assigned to those companies that  in am best s opinion  have demonstrated an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders 
these ratings are subject to periodic review by  and may be revised at the sole discretion of  am best 
the rating a excellent by am best is the third highest of rating levels 
s p maintains a letter rating system ranging from aaa extremely strong to r under regulatory supervision 
within these categories  aaa extremely strong is the highest  followed by aa  aa and aa very strong and a  a and a strong 
publications of s p indicate that the a  a and a ratings are assigned to those companies that  in s p s opinion  have demonstrated strong financial security characteristics  but are somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings 
these ratings may be changed  suspended  or withdrawn at the discretion of s p 
the rating a strong by s p is the sixth highest of twenty one rating levels 
moody s maintains a letter rating system ranging from aaa to c 
within these categories  aaa is the highest  followed by aa and a 
within each of these categories  ratings are further broken down into aa  aa and aa ratings may be changed  suspended  or withdrawn at the discretion of moody s 
the rating a by moody s is the sixth highest of twenty one rating levels 
competition the insurance and reinsurance industries are mature and highly competitive 
insurance and reinsurance companies compete on the basis of many factors  including premium charges  general reputation and perceived financial strength  the terms and conditions of the products offered  ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payments  reputation and experience in the particular risk to be underwritten  the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized  capacity and coverages offered and various other factors 
these factors operate at the individual market participant level and in the aggregate across the insurance and reinsurance industry more generally 
in addition  background economic conditions and variations in the insurance and reinsurance buying practices of insureds and ceding companies  by participant and in the aggregate  contribute to cyclical movements in rates  terms and conditions and may impact industry aggregate financial results 
we compete in the bermuda  us  london and international insurance and reinsurance markets directly with numerous other parties  including established global insurance and reinsurance companies  other start up insurance and reinsurance entities  as well as potential capital markets and securitization structures aimed at managing catastrophe and other risks 
many of these entities have significantly larger amounts of capital and more employees than endurance holdings and its subsidiaries and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in our insurance segment  where competition tends to be focused more on availability  service and considerations other than price  we compete with insurers that provide property and casualty based lines of insurance in each of our markets as follows north america ace ltd

in general  at the end of  we believe operating conditions continue to be competitive 
in certain catastrophe exposed classes of property business  we experienced a pricing environment that was flat to slightly upward  however  for the remaining insurance and reinsurance lines of property and casualty business  we experienced downward pricing driven largely by relatively high levels of underwriting capacity and competition driven by distressed insurers 
we continue to maintain our adherence to underwriting standards by declining business when pricing  terms and conditions did not meet our underwriting criteria 
in  we believe the following two primary influences may affect the market for our insurance and reinsurance products continuing unsettled and deteriorating global economic conditions and the financial condition of certain of our competitors 
the united states and other markets around the world have been experiencing worsening economic conditions  including substantial and continuing disruptions to financial markets and asset valuations 
these dislocations in the investment markets have in turn eroded capital and surplus positions of many of our competitors  in places limiting their ability to compete effectively for business 
we believe these two factors have and will continue to contribute to changes in market conditions within both the reinsurance and insurance market places 
employees as of february   we had full time employees 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
item a 
risk factors before investing in any of our securities  you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this annual report on form k 
these risks could materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition and cause the trading price of our securities to decline 
you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to our business the current financial crisis has resulted in unprecedented levels of market volatility  which may significantly affect our business  results of operations  ability to meet liquidity needs  access to capital and cost of capital 
global capital markets and the economy generally  in both the united states and elsewhere  have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption since the second half of  due in part to financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system and the financial markets generally 
in recent months  this volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels 
concerns over the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  a declining real estate market in the us  energy costs and geopolitical issues  among other factors  have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the capital markets generally going forward 
these circumstances have also exerted downward pressure on stock prices and reduced access to the equity and debt markets for many issuers  including the company 
this unprecedented market volatility and general decline in the markets has directly and materially affected the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio  results of operations  access to capital and cost of capital 
we need liquidity to pay our operating expenses  interest on our debt and dividends on our ordinary shares and preferred shares  maintain our securities lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities 
without sufficient liquidity  we may be forced to curtail our operations  which would have the potential to materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
the principal sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums and cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets 
sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short and long term instruments  including indebtedness  preferred securities and ordinary shares 
in the event current resources do not satisfy our liquidity needs  we may need to seek additional financing 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the volume of trading activities  the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a downturn in the insurance and reinsurance markets 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business 
such market conditions may limit our ability to replace  in a timely manner  maturing liabilities  satisfy statutory capital requirements  generate market related revenue to meet liquidity needs  and access the capital necessary to grow our business 
as such  we may be forced to delay raising capital  issue shorter tenor securities than we prefer  or bear an unattractive cost of capital  which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility 
we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk  including changes in interest rates  credit spreads  and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk  including changes in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  real estate markets  foreign currency exchange rates  market volatility  the performance of the economy in general  the performance of the specific obligors included in our portfolio and other factors outside our control 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates  in the absence of other countervailing changes  will increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio 
our mitigation efforts with respect to interest rate risk are primarily focused towards maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile 
however  our estimate of the liability cash flow profile may be inaccurate  and we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to cover the liability 
although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads 
with the recent widening of credit spreads  the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio has increased  as have other than temporary impairments 
if issuer credit spreads continue to widen or increase significantly over an extended period of time  it would likely exacerbate these effects  resulting in greater and additional other than temporary impairments 
if credit spreads tighten significantly  it will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities 
in addition  a reduction in market liquidity has made it difficult to value certain of our securities as trading has become less frequent 
as such  valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period to period changes  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
our primary foreign currency exchange risks are related to net income from foreign operations  non us dollar denominated investments  and investments in foreign subsidiaries 
in general  the weakening of foreign currencies versus the us dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations  the value of non us dollar denominated investments  and investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our primary foreign currency exchange risks are described more fully under we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
a portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to alternative investments  which we expect to have different risk characteristics than our investments in traditional fixed maturity securities and short term investments  which in turn could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 
a portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to alternative investments which we expect to have different risk characteristics than our investments in traditional fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
our alternative investments include investments in funds which invest in senior secured bank debt and high yield securities  distressed debt  derivatives and equity long short strategies 
the amount and timing of net investment income from such alternative funds tends to be uneven as a result of the performance of the underlying investments 
the timing of distributions from the funds  which depends on particular events relating to the underlying investments  as well as the funds schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash  can be difficult to predict 
as a result  the amount of net investment income that we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
recent equity  real estate and credit market volatility have further reduced net investment income and related yields for these types of investments and we may continue to experience reduced net investment income due to continued volatility in the equity  real estate and credit markets in the future 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
these investments expose us to market risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk and credit risk 
in addition  we typically do not hold the underlying securities of these investments in our custody accounts 
as a result  we generally do not have the ability to quantify the risks associated with these investments in the same manner for which we have for our fixed maturity securities 
the performance of these investments is also dependent on the individual investment managers and the investment strategies 
it is possible that the investment managers will leave and or the investment strategies will become ineffective or that such managers will fail to follow our investment guidelines 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 
the effect that governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will have on such markets generally or on us is difficult to determine at this time 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and continued concerns about financial institutions ongoing viability  numerous regulatory and governmental actions have been taken or proposed 
within the united states  the federal reserve has taken action through reduced federal funds rates and the expansion of acceptable collateral for its loans to provide additional liquidity 
numerous financial institutions have received capital both in the form of emergency loans and direct equity investments by the us department of treasury 
in early  the american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra was enacted to provide further stimulus to institutions that have received or will receive financial assistance under the troubled asset relief program 
within the united kingdom and the european union  similar actions including interest rate cuts and capital injections into financial institutions have been undertaken  including certain institutions that are obligors of the perpetual preferred equity securities in our investment portfolio 
an additional regulatory concern involving residential mortgage backed securities is cram down legislation currently under consideration in the us congress 
if passed  this legislation would reallocate losses from defaults of the underlying residential mortgages across all tranches of the security  effectively negating the contractual terms of the security 
approximately of our fixed income portfolio  which includes fixed maturity investments  short term investments and preferred equity securities  is in agency and non agency mortgage backed securities and as a result  any such action could have a material affect on the value and performance of our investment portfolio 
there can be no assurance as to the effect that any such governmental actions or future regulatory initiatives may have on certain investments in our investment portfolio  or on our competitive position  results of operations  business and financial condition in particular 
governmental initiatives intended to alleviate the current financial crisis may not be effective and  may be accompanied by other initiatives  including new capital requirements or other regulations  that could materially affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity in ways that we cannot predict 
on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
the eesa includes a provision to grant the us treasury department the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions 
the eesa was enacted in response to the financial crisis affecting the us banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions 
the eesa or similar proposals  including the arra  as well as companion actions such as monetary or fiscal actions of the us federal reserve board or comparable authorities in other countries  may fail to stabilize the financial markets 
these new forms of legislation and other proposals or actions may also have other consequences  including material effects on interest rates  foreign exchange rates and the markets for the financial instruments purchased and sold by the us department of treasury pursuant to the eesa or the arra  which could materially affect our investments  results of operations and liquidity in ways that we cannot predict 
the failure to effectively implement this legislation and related proposals or actions could also result in material adverse effects  notably increased constraints on the liquidity available in the banking system and financial markets and increased pressure on stock prices  any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and the trading price of our ordinary or preferred shares 
in the event of future material deterioration in business conditions  we may need to raise additional capital or consider other transactions to manage our capital position or our liquidity 
it is possible that competitors of the company  such as companies that engage in both life and property casualty insurance lines of business  may be permitted to access funds through the eesa or arra programs which could have a negative impact on the company s competitive position 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic approved the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp on november  the program was designed to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts  and certain holding companies  and by providing full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
because we may purchase securities from the types of companies that are subject to the tlgp  the failure to effectively implement the program could result in an adverse effect on the carrying value of such securities in our investment portfolio if the existence of the fdic guarantee does not strengthen confidence or encourage liquidity in the marketplace 
in addition  we are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities and non governmental self regulatory agencies 
in light of the current financial crisis  some of these authorities are or may in the future consider enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or otherwise assure the stability of institutions under their supervision 
these authorities may also seek to exercise their supervisory or enforcement authority in new or more robust ways 
all of these possibilities  if they occurred  could affect the way we conduct our business and manage our capital  and may require us to satisfy increased capital requirements  any of which in turn could materially affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
losses due to defaults by others  including issuers of investment securities which include structured securities such as commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities or other high yielding bonds or reinsurance counterparties  could adversely affect the value of our investments  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold  customers  reinsurers  clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on the principal and interest they owe to us due to bankruptcy  insolvency  lack of liquidity  adverse economic conditions  operational failure  fraud or other reasons 
we are also subject to the risk that the underlying collateral within loan backed securities  including mortgage backed and asset backed securities  may default on principal and interest payments causing an adverse change in cash flows paid to us 
at december   the fixed income securities of billion in our investment portfolio represented of our total cash and invested assets 
the occurrence of a major economic downturn such as the current downturn in the economy  acts of corporate malfeasance  widening risk spreads  or other events that adversely impact the issuers  guarantors or underlying collateral of these securities could cause the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and our net income to decline and the default rate of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio to increase 
a ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular securities  or similar trends that could worsen the credit quality of issuers  such as the corporate issuers of securities in our investment portfolio  could also have a similar effect 
with economic uncertainty  credit quality of issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected 
similarly  a ratings downgrade affecting a loan backed security we hold could indicate the credit quality of that security has deteriorated 
any event reducing the value of these securities other than on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
levels of write down or impairment are impacted by our assessment of the intent and ability to hold securities which have declined in value until recovery 
we could incur substantial losses and reduced liquidity if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations  including those institutions that participate in our credit facility and the counterparty to our million variable delivery equity forward  fails 
we have exposure to counterparties in many different industries and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  hedge funds and other investment funds and other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty 
in addition  with respect to secured transactions  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the obligation 
due to the uncertainty associated with casualty business  current reinsurance recoverables are subject to the credit risk of the reinsurers 
we maintain cash balances  including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts  significantly in excess of the us federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits at various depository institutions 
we also maintain cash balances in foreign banks and institutions and rely upon funding commitments from several banks and financial institutions that participate in our credit facility 
in addition  a financial institution is the counterparty in our variable delivery equity forward sale agreement that provides us with up to million of additional liquidity 
as the worldwide fallout from the credit crisis persists  the financial strength of some depository institutions and investment banks has diminished  and this trend may continue 
if one or more of these financial institutions were to fail  our ability to access cash balances  draw down on our credit facility or receive funds from our variable delivery equity forward sale might be temporarily or permanently limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our participation in a securities lending program subjects us to potential liquidity and other risks 
we participate in a securities lending program whereby securities  including fixed maturity and short term investments  are loaned by us to third parties 
we retain all economic interest in the securities we lend  retain the earnings and cash flows associated with the loaned securities and receive a fee from the borrower for the temporary use of the securities 
we require collateral in the form of cash  government securities and letters of credit at a rate of of the market value of the loaned securities 
we invest such collateral in other securities  primarily overnight repurchase agreements  and prior to the first quarter of  in us treasuries  us government agency securities  mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities and corporate fixed income securities 
returns of loaned securities by the third parties would require us to return the collateral associated with such loaned securities 
in addition  in some cases  the maturity of the securities held as invested collateral ie  securities that we have purchased with collateral received from the third parties may exceed the term of the related securities on loan and the market value may fall below the amount received as collateral and invested 
if we are required to return significant amounts of collateral on short notice  and we are forced to sell securities to meet the return obligation  we may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner  be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize under normal market conditions  or both 
in addition  under stressful capital market and economic conditions  such as those conditions we have experienced recently  liquidity broadly deteriorates  which may further restrict our ability to sell securities 
further deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to additional investment losses 
the prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets  including  among other things  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in a number of large financial institutions  have resulted in realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio 
depending on market conditions  we could incur substantial additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  equity  business and financial strength and debt ratings 
our valuation of fixed maturity investments  short term investments and preferred equity securities may include methodologies  estimations and assumptions  which are subject to differing interpretations  and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
fixed maturity investments  which are reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  represented the majority of our total cash and invested assets 
we have categorized these securities as well as our short term investments and preferred equity securities into a three level hierarchy  based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
an asset or liability s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation 
sfas defines the input levels as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices for similar assets in markets that are active  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other than quoted prices in level  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
unobservable inputs reflect the company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
the company uses quoted values and other data provided by nationally recognized independent pricing sources as inputs into its process for determining fair values of its fixed income portfolio 
independent pricing services and brokers obtain market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets 
each source has its own proprietary method for determining the fair value of securities 
as such  prices provided by independent pricing services and independent broker quotes can vary widely  even for the same security 
the company obtains multiple prices for its securities where available 
to validate the techniques or models used by pricing sources  the company s review process includes  but is not limited to i quantitative analysis eg  comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark  with significant differences identified and investigated  ii initial and ongoing evaluation of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value  and iii comparing the fair value estimates to its knowledge of the current market 
based on the above review  the company will challenge any prices for a security or portfolio which are considered not to be representative of fair value 
please see note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion on the percentage and types of securities held in each level 
the company obtains market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets 
each source has its own proprietary method for determining the fair value of securities that are not actively traded 
in general  these methods involve the use of matrix pricing in which the independent pricing source uses observable market inputs including  but not limited to  investment yields  credit risks and spreads  benchmarking of like securities  broker dealer quotes  reported trades and sector groupings to determine a reasonable fair market value 
in addition  pricing vendors use model processes  such as an option adjusted spread model  to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the option adjusted spread model is commonly used to estimate fair value for securities such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
in certain circumstances  when fair market values are unavailable from these independent pricing sources  quotes are obtained directly from broker dealers who are active in the corresponding markets 
the fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments  including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
such quotes are subject to the validation procedures noted above 
during periods of market disruption including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates  rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain of our securities  for example mortgage backed securities  if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable 
in addition  there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment 
in such cases  more securities may fall to level and thus require more subjectivity and management judgment 
as such  valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods  which are more sophisticated or require greater estimation thereby resulting in values which may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold 
further  rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the determination of the other than temporary impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
the determination of the amount of other than temporary impairments taken on our investments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised 
there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements 
furthermore  additional impairments may need to be taken in the future  which could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments 
some of our investments are relatively illiquid and are in asset classes that have been experiencing significant market valuation fluctuations 
we hold certain investments that may lack liquidity  such as our alternative investments 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements or are required to post or return collateral in connection with our investment portfolio or securities lending activities  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
the reported value of our relatively illiquid types of investments and  at times  our high quality  generally liquid asset classes  do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset 
if we were forced to sell certain of our assets in the current market  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them  and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 
our investment liquidity and investment performance may affect our financial assets and ability to conduct business 
we derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets 
as a result  our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio  which consists primarily of fixed maturity investments 
our income derived from our invested assets including net realized losses was million for the year ended december  our operating results are subject to a variety of investment risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
in addition  we are subject to pre payment or reinvestment risk as well as restrictions on redemptions or sale of certain of our investments 
with respect to our liabilities  we strive to structure our investments in a manner that recognizes their cash flow profile and our potential liquidity needs 
in that regard  we attempt to correlate the maturity and duration of our investment portfolio to our liability profile 
however  if our liquidity needs or liability profile unexpectedly change  we may not be successful in continuing to structure our investment portfolio in that manner 
the market value of our fixed maturity investments will be subject to fluctuations depending on changes in various factors  including prevailing interest rates 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in correlating our investment portfolio with our liabilities  we may be forced to liquidate our investments at times and prices that are not optimal  which could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our investment portfolio 
at december  the liquidity in the debt capital markets was low compared to historical levels and that trend is continuing in the decrease in liquidity could result in investment losses if the company was forced to immediately sell significant portions of its fixed maturity investment portfolio 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
although we take measures to attempt to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
our mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
a significant portion of the investment portfolio matures each year  allowing for reinvestment at current market rates 
the portfolio is actively managed  and trades are made to balance our exposure to interest rates 
however  a significant increase in interest rates would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our book value 
changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results 
unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments  particularly if it is required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively 
the impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income  net equity  and other relevant financial statement line items 
in particular  recent guidance and ongoing projects put in place by standard setters globally have indicated a possible move away from the current insurance accounting models toward more fair value based models which could introduce significant volatility in the earnings of insurance industry participants 
furthermore  rules relating to certain accounting practices in the financial guarantee insurance and reinsurance industry are currently being reviewed by applicable regulatory bodies and any changes required by that review could have a material effect on the reported operating results and financial condition of the industry or particular market participants 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may not be indicative of our long term prospects 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations result from a variety of factors  including the seasonality of the reinsurance and insurance business  the volume and mix of reinsurance and insurance products that we write  loss experience on our reinsurance and insurance liabilities  the performance of our investment portfolio and our ability to assess and integrate our risk management strategy effectively 
in particular  we seek to underwrite products and make investments to achieve long term results 
as a result  our short term results of operations may not be indicative of our long term prospects 
if actual claims exceed our reserve for losses and loss expenses  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure or reinsure 
we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
loss reserve estimates are refined continually in an ongoing process as experience develops and claims are reported and settled 
establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
moreover  these uncertainties are greater for companies like us than for those with a longer operating history because we do not yet have an extensive loss history 
because of this uncertainty  it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate 
to the extent we determine that actual losses and loss expenses exceed our expectations and loss reserves recorded in our financial statements  we will be required to immediately increase our reserve for losses and loss expenses 
this could cause a material reduction in our profitability and capital 
as a property  agriculture and catastrophe insurer and reinsurer  we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes 
our property  agriculture and catastrophe insurance and reinsurance lines expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes 
catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events  including earthquakes  hurricanes  hailstorms  droughts  severe weather  floods  fires  tornadoes  volcano eruptions  explosions and other natural or man made disasters 
the global geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas throughout the world  including  but not limited to  windstorms in the united kingdom and continental europe  hurricanes in florida  the gulf coast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states  typhoons and earthquakes in japan  earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states and drought and flooding in the midwestern united states 
in addition  changing climate conditions  primarily rising global temperatures  may be increasing  or may in the future increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes  including weather events  and may create new types of catastrophe losses 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
in the event that we experience catastrophe losses  there is a possibility that our premiums will be inadequate to cover these risks 
in addition  because accounting regulations do not permit insurers and reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur  claims from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to write new business also could be adversely impacted 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls and the purchase of third party reinsurance  catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the actual nature of such events when they occur could be more frequent or severe than contemplated in our pricing and risk management expectations 
as a result  the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see item business enterprise risk management underwriting risk management 
as a property and casualty insurer and reinsurer  we could face losses from war  terrorism and political unrest 
we may have substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
these risks are inherently unpredictable  although recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity 
it is difficult to predict their occurrence with statistical certainty or to estimate the amount of loss an occurrence will generate 
accordingly  it is possible that our loss reserves will be inadequate to cover these risks 
we closely monitor the amount and types of coverage we provide for terrorism risk under insurance policies and reinsurance treaties 
we often seek to exclude terrorism when we cannot reasonably evaluate the risk of loss or charge an appropriate premium for such risk 
even in cases where we have deliberately sought to exclude coverage  we may not be able to eliminate completely our exposure to terrorist acts  and thus it is possible that these acts will have a material adverse effect on us 
the risks associated with property and casualty reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us 
because we participate in property and casualty reinsurance markets  the success of our underwriting efforts depends  in part  upon the policies  procedures and expertise of the ceding companies making the original underwriting decisions 
we face the risk that these ceding companies may fail to accurately assess the risks that they assume initially  which  in turn  may lead us to inaccurately assess the risks we assume 
if we fail to establish and receive appropriate premium rates  we could face significant losses on these contracts 
if actual renewals of our existing contracts do not meet expectations  our gross premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our contracts are generally for a one year term 
in our financial forecasting process  we make assumptions about the renewal of our prior year s contracts 
if actual renewals do not meet expectations  our gross premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this risk is especially prevalent in the first quarter of each year when a large number of reinsurance contracts are subject to renewal 
the development of our us based insurance operations is subject to increased risk from changing market conditions 
excess and surplus lines insurance are a substantial portion of the business written by our us based insurance operations 
excess and surplus lines insurance covers risks that are typically more complex and unusual than standard risks and require a high degree of specialized underwriting 
as a result  excess and surplus lines risks do not often fit the underwriting criteria of standard insurance carriers 
our excess and surplus lines insurance business fills the insurance needs of businesses with unique characteristics and is generally considered higher risk than those in the standard market 
if our underwriting staff inadequately judges and prices the risks associated with the business underwritten in the excess and surplus lines market  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
further  the excess and surplus lines market is significantly affected by the conditions of the property and casualty insurance market in general 
this cyclicality can be more pronounced in the excess and surplus market than in the standard insurance market 
during times of hard market conditions when market conditions are more favorable to insurers  as rates increase and coverage terms become more restrictive  business tends to move from the admitted market to the excess and surplus lines market and growth in the excess and surplus market can be significantly more rapid than growth in the standard insurance market 
when soft market conditions are prevalent when market conditions are less favorable to insurers  standard insurance carriers tend to loosen underwriting standards and expand market share by moving into business lines traditionally characterized as excess and surplus lines  exacerbating the effect of rate decreases 
if we fail to manage the cyclical nature and volatility of the revenues and profit we generate in the excess and surplus lines market  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or on our results of operations 
we seek to limit our loss exposure by writing many of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  adhering to maximum limitations on policies written in defined geographical zones  limiting program size for each client  establishing per risk and per occurrence limitations for each event and following prudent underwriting guidelines for each program written 
in the case of proportional treaties  we seek per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event 
most of our direct liability insurance policies include maximum aggregate limitations 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure through geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and whether a policy falls within particular zone limits 
disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise 
as a result  various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  may not be enforceable in the manner we intend and some or all of our other loss limitation methods may prove to be ineffective 
underwriting is a matter of judgment  involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control  and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
one or more future catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity 
we may be unable to purchase reinsurance and our net income could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event of an unusual loss experience 
we purchase reinsurance if it is deemed prudent from a risk mitigation perspective or if it is expected to have a favorable cost benefit relationship relative to our retained risk portfolio 
changes in the availability and cost of reinsurance  which are subject to market conditions that are outside of our control  may reduce to some extent our ability to use reinsurance to balance exposures across our reinsurance or insurance operations 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable or obtain such reinsurance from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to our clients 
in addition  reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us even though they are able to do so 
the failure of one or more of the our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and  depending upon the amount of reinsurance we have purchased  could cause us to incur a significant loss 
since we are dependent on key executives  the loss of any of these executives or our inability to retain other key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our success substantially depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and upon the ability of our senior management and other key employees to implement our business strategy 
we believe there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we compete 
we rely substantially upon the services of kenneth j 
lestrange  our chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board of directors  michael j 
mcguire  our chief financial officer  michael e 
angelina  our chief actuary and chief risk officer  david s 
cash  our chief underwriting officer  michael p 
fujii  the president and chief executive officer of our worldwide insurance operations and william m 
jewett  the president and chief executive officer of our worldwide reinsurance operations 
we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining key personnel since our inception 
the loss of any of their services or the services of other members of our management team or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impede the further implementation of our business strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
our business could be adversely affected by bermuda employment restrictions 
we will need to continue to hire employees to work in bermuda 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
current bermuda law limits the duration of work permits to six years  with certain exemptions for key employees 
all of our bermuda based professional employees who require work permits  including messrs 
lestrange  mcguire  angelina  fuji and jewett have been granted permits by the bermuda government 
the terms of such permits usually range from three to five years at the time of grant depending on the individual 
it is possible that we could lose the services of one or more of our key employees if we are unable to obtain or renew their work permits  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a decline in our financial strength ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease 
ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
we currently maintain an am best financial strength rating of a excellent with a stable outlook and a s p financial strength rating of a strong with a stable outlook  other than armtech 
we currently maintain an am best financial strength rating of a excellent with a stable outlook on armtech 
because all of our ratings are subject to continual review  the retention of these ratings cannot be assured 
if our ratings are reduced from their current level by am best or s p  our competitive position in the insurance and reinsurance industry would suffer 
such a downgrade may have a material negative impact on our ability to expand our insurance and reinsurance portfolio and renew our existing insurance and reinsurance policies and agreements  require us to establish trusts or post letters of credit for ceding company clients  and could trigger provisions allowing some ceding company clients to terminate their reinsurance contracts with us on terms disadvantageous to us 
in addition  a downgrade of our am best rating below b two levels below our current rating would constitute an event of default under our bank credit facility 
each of the effects of a downgrade of our financial strength rating described above could make it more expensive or otherwise difficult for us to compete in certain business segments in which we would otherwise desire to operate 
if this were to occur  we could suffer a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  and the market price for our securities  including any ordinary shares  could be materially and adversely affected 
in light of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions  including our competitors in the insurance industry  we believe it is possible that rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny they apply when analyzing companies in our industry  may increase the frequency and scope of their reviews  may request additional information from the companies that they rate including additional information regarding the valuation of investment securities held  and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of certain rating levels 
we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take  or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies  which could adversely affect our business 
as with other companies in the financial services industry  our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice 
our holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints affect our ability to pay dividends and make other payments 
endurance holdings is a holding company and  as such  has no substantial operations of its own 
dividends and other permitted distributions from our operating subsidiaries are expected to be endurance holdings primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements  including debt service payments and other expenses  and to pay dividends  if any  to shareholders 
bermuda law and regulations  including  but not limited to  bermuda insurance regulations  restrict the declaration and payment of dividends and the making of distributions by endurance bermuda unless certain regulatory requirements are met 
the inability of endurance bermuda to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable endurance holdings to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
in addition  endurance holdings us and us operating subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends 
we therefore do not expect to receive material dividends from these operating subsidiaries for the foreseeable future 
endurance holdings is subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that will affect its ability to pay dividends on its ordinary shares  class a shares and non cumulative preferred shares  series a the series a preferred shares  and make other payments 
under the bermuda companies act  as amended the companies act  endurance holdings may declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of retained earnings or contributed surplus only if it has reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or would after the payment be  able to pay its liabilities as they become due and if the realizable value of its assets would thereby not be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts 
in addition  the terms of our credit facility prohibit endurance holdings from declaring or paying any dividends if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such declaration or payment or would result from such declaration or payment 
in addition  the terms of the series a preferred shares prohibit the declaration or payment of dividends on our ordinary shares unless dividends on the series a preferred shares have been declared and paid 
preference shares  including the series a preferred shares  may also not be redeemed if as a result of the redemption  our issued share capital would be reduced below the minimum capital specified in the memorandum of association of endurance holdings

the cost of reinsurance security arrangements may materially impact our margins 
as a bermuda reinsurer  endurance bermuda is required to post collateral security with respect to reinsurance liabilities it assumes from ceding insurers domiciled in the us the posting of collateral security is generally required in order for us ceding companies to obtain credit on their us statutory financial statements with respect to reinsurance liabilities ceded to unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurers  such as endurance bermuda 
under applicable statutory provisions  the security arrangements may be in the form of letters of credit  reinsurance trusts maintained by third party trustees or funds withheld arrangements whereby the trusteed assets are held by the ceding company 
endurance bermuda has the ability to issue up to billion in letters of credit under our letter of credit and revolving credit facility that expires on may  if this facility is not sufficient or if the company is unable to renew this facility or is unable to arrange for other types of security on commercially acceptable terms  the ability of endurance bermuda to provide reinsurance to us based clients may be severely limited 
security arrangements may subject our assets to security interests and or require that a portion of our assets be pledged to  or otherwise held by  third parties 
although the investment income derived from our assets while held in trust typically accrues to our benefit  the investment of these assets is governed by the investment regulations of the state of domicile of the ceding insurer  which may be more restrictive than the investment regulations applicable to us under bermuda law 
the restrictions may result in lower investment yields on these assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
profitability may be adversely impacted by inflation 
the effects of inflation could cause the cost of claims from catastrophes or other events to rise in the future 
our reserve for losses and loss expenses includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
adverse changes to the economy in the countries in which we operate could lower the demand for our insurance and reinsurance products and could have a materially adverse effect on the profitability of our operations 
factors such as consumer spending  business investment  government spending  the volatility and strength of the capital markets  and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and  indirectly  the amount and profitability of our business 
in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment  lower family income  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment and lower consumer spending  the demand for insurance products could be adversely affected 
adverse changes in the economy could potentially lead our customers to have less need for insurance coverage  to cancel existing insurance policies  modify coverage or to not renew with us  and our premium revenue could be adversely affected 
challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay premiums as they come due 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the united states and other countries  which may have an adverse effect on us  in part because we are dependent upon the above discussed factors 
we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
we have made a significant investment in the capitalization of endurance uk  which is denominated in british sterling 
in addition  we enter into reinsurance and insurance contracts where we are obligated to pay losses in currencies other than us dollars 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross premiums  prior to deposit accounting adjustments  were written in currencies other than the us dollar 
a portion of our cash and cash equivalents  investments and loss reserves are also denominated in non us currencies 
the majority of our operating foreign currency assets and liabilities are denominated in euros  british sterling  canadian dollars  japanese yen and australian dollars 
we may  from time to time  experience losses from fluctuations in the values of these and other non us currencies  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we periodically buy and sell currencies or investment securities denominated in non us dollars in an attempt to match our non us dollar assets to our related non us dollar liabilities 
we have no currency hedges in place  however  as part of our matching strategy  we consider the use of hedges when we become aware of probable significant losses that will be paid in non us currencies 
however  it is possible that we will not successfully match our exposures or structure the hedges so as to effectively manage these risks 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  access to capital and cost of capital 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than twelve months 
recently  the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully  to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses  and to maintain our current rating agency ratings 
we need liquidity to pay our operating expenses and without sufficient liquidity we will be forced to curtail our operations  and our business will suffer 
the principal sources of our liquidity are our invested assets 
sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short and long term instruments  including repurchase agreements  commercial paper  medium and long term debt  junior subordinated debt securities  capital securities and shareholders equity 
in the event current resources do not satisfy our needs  we may have to seek additional financing 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the volume of trading activities  the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business  most significantly our insurance operations 
such market conditions may limit our ability to replace  in a timely manner  maturing liabilities  satisfy statutory capital requirements  generate fee income and market related revenue to meet liquidity needs  and access the capital necessary to grow our business 
as such  we may be forced to delay raising capital  issue shorter tenor securities than we prefer  or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and in any case such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our already outstanding securities 
recently our credit spreads have widened considerably 
our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets and an inability to obtain adequate capital 
our failure to comply with restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing our senior notes or our current or future credit facility could trigger prepayment obligations  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries with respect to  among other things  the incurrence of liens and the disposition of capital stock of these subsidiaries 
in addition  our credit facility requires us and or certain of our subsidiaries to comply with certain covenants  including the maintenance of a minimum consolidated net tangible worth and restrictions on the payment of dividends 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under the indentures or our credit facility  which  if not cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay the notes or any amounts outstanding under the credit facility prior to maturity 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us 
we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
in the year ended december   our top three brokers represented approximately of our gross premiums written before deposit accounting adjustments 
see item business distribution 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers  particularly as a result of the merger of aon corporation and benfield group limited  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance or reinsurance contracts to brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us 
if a broker fails to make such a payment  in a significant majority of business that we write  it is highly likely that we will be liable to the client for the deficiency because of local laws or contractual obligations 
likewise  when the client pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid and  in most cases  the client will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world with respect to most of our insurance and reinsurance business 
to date we have not experienced any losses related to such credit risks 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
recent examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include larger settlements and jury awards for professionals and corporate directors and officers covered by professional liability and directors and officers liability insurance  a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers in purported class action litigations relating to claims handling  insurance sales practices and other practices related to the conduct of our business  increased litigation and regulatory involvement in the claims settlement process from claims arising from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  and uncertainties associated with liability coverages related to sub prime mortgage exposures 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could harm our business 
we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely impact our operating margins 
the insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive 
we compete with major us and us insurers and reinsurers  including other bermuda based insurers and reinsurers 
for information regarding competition in each of our business segments  see item business business segments 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources 
a number of newly organized  bermuda based insurance and reinsurance entities compete in the same market segments in which we operate 
in addition  we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the segments of the insurance and reinsurance market in which we operate or of existing companies that may be planning to raise additional capital 
increasing competition could result in fewer submissions  lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our growth and profitability 
further  insurance risk linked securities and derivative and other non traditional risk transfer mechanisms and vehicles are being developed and offered by other parties  including non insurance company entities  which could impact the demand for traditional insurance or reinsurance 
a number of new  proposed or potential industry or legislative developments could further increase competition in our industry 
new competition from these developments could cause the demand for insurance or reinsurance to fall or the expense of customer acquisition and retention to increase  either of which could have a material adverse affect on our growth and profitability 
the historical cyclicality of the property and casualty reinsurance industry may cause fluctuations in our results 
historically  property and casualty insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition  frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events  levels of capacity  general economic conditions and other factors 
demand for insurance and reinsurance is influenced significantly by prevailing general economic conditions and  in the case of reinsurance  the underwriting results of primary property and casualty insurers 
the supply of insurance and reinsurance is related to prevailing prices  the levels of insured losses and the levels of industry surplus which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance and reinsurance industry 
as a result  the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels 
the recent increase in the supply of insurance and reinsurance as a result of capital provided by new entrants and by the commitment of additional capital by existing reinsurers  has caused insurance and reinsurance prices in many of the markets in which we participate to decrease since recent or future legislation may decrease the demand for our property catastrophe reinsurance products and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in january  the state of florida enacted legislation known as bill no 
cs hb a the bill  which increased the access of primary florida insurers to the fhcf 
through the fhcf  florida currently provides below market rate reinsurance of up to billion per season  with florida able to further increase the limits up to an additional billion per season 
in addition  the legislation allows florida insurers to choose a lower retention level for fhcf reinsurance coverage  at specified rates for specified layers of coverage 
further  the legislation expanded the ability of citizens  a state sponsored entity  to compete with private insurance and reinsurance companies  such as ours  by  for example  authorizing citizens to write multi peril policies in high risk account coverage areas 
moreover  the legislation mandated the reduction of citizens in force rates by an average of  repealed a rate increase that was to be effective march   and froze any additional rate increases for the remainder of also  citizens premium rates are no longer required to be non competitive with the voluntary  private market and are no longer required to be based on the highest rate offered by the top insurers in a given area 
in sum  the legislation reduced the role of the private markets in providing support for florida based risks  a market in which we have established substantial market share 
efforts in to reduce the scale of the state involvement in the private markets were not successful 
we believe the bill caused a substantial decline in the private reinsurance and insurance markets in and relating to florida  and contributed to the decline in our property catastrophe gross premiums written in and as compared to proposals to reduce the expansion of the fhcf introduced in never materialized and there can be no assurance that additional legislation reducing the size of the private markets relating to florida will not be enacted 
it is also possible that other states  particularly those with atlantic or gulf coast exposures  may enact new or expanded legislation based on the florida precedent  or may otherwise enact legislation  which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products 
alternatively  legislation adversely impacting the private markets could be enacted on a regional or at the federal level 
moreover  we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded capacity of the fhcf  which could lead either to a severe dislocation or the necessity of federal intervention in the florida market  either of which would adversely impact the private insurance and reinsurance industry 
acquisitions or strategic investments that we made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our strategy  we have pursued and may continue to pursue growth through acquisitions and or strategic investments in new businesses 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business or new personnel could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
successful integration will depend on  among other things  our ability to effectively integrate acquired businesses or new personnel into our existing risk management techniques  our ability to effectively manage any regulatory issues created by our entry into new markets and geographic locations  our ability to retain key personnel and other operational and economic factors 
there can be no assurance that the integration of acquired business or new personnel will be successful or that the business acquired will prove to be profitable or sustainable 
the failure to integrate successfully or to manage the challenges presented by the integration process may adversely impact our financial results 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions or strategic investments will depend  in part  on our success in addressing these risks 
any failure by us to effectively implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the regulatory system under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses  permits  authorizations or accreditations  or may be able to do so only at great cost 
in addition  we may not be able to comply fully with  or obtain appropriate exemptions from  the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance or reinsurance companies or holding companies 
failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and fines and other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the laws and regulations under which we operate  such as the regulations governing our insurance rates and forms  the us multiple peril crop insurance program and the purchase of reinsurance by property insurers in florida  could be revised in a manner materially adverse to the manner in which we conduct our business 
in addition  the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework continues to be subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the us and various states within the us if our bermuda insurance or reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any state in the us  we could face inquiries or challenges to the future operations of these companies 
although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than the admitted market  the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future 
federal and or state measures may be introduced and promulgated that could result in increased oversight and regulation of surplus lines insurance 
additionally  some recent and pending cases in florida and california courts have raised potentially significant questions regarding surplus lines insurance in those states such as whether surplus lines insurers will be subject to policy form content  filing and approval requirements or additional taxes 
these cases also could foreshadow more extensive oversight of surplus lines insurance by other jurisdictions 
endurance american and american merchants write insurance on an admitted basis within the us and are subject to extensive regulation under state statutes which confer regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers on state insurance commissioners 
such regulation generally is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors or shareholders of the insurer 
our current or future business strategy could cause one or more of our currently unregulated non insurance subsidiaries to become subject to some form of regulation 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business  and could also result in fines and other sanctions  any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
we could be required to allocate considerable time and resources to comply with any new or additional regulatory requirements  and any such requirements may impact the operations of our insurance non insurance subsidiaries and ultimately could impact our financial condition as well 
in addition  we could be adversely affected if a regulatory authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulation 
heightened scrutiny of issues and practices in the insurance industry may adversely affect our business 
we believe that certain government authorities  including state officials in florida  are continuing to scrutinize and investigate a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry 
while we have not been named in any actions or proceedings  it is possible such scrutiny could expand to include us in the future  and it is also possible that these investigations or related regulatory developments will mandate or otherwise give rise to changes in industry practices in a fashion that increases our costs or requires us to alter how we conduct our business 
we cannot predict the ultimate effect that these investigations  and any changes in industry practice  including future legislation or regulations that may become applicable to us  will have on the insurance industry  the regulatory framework  or our business 
as noted above  because we frequently assume the credit risk of the counterparties with whom we do business throughout our insurance and reinsurance operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected if the credit quality of these counterparties is severely impacted by the current investigations in the insurance industry or by changes to industry practices 
operational risks  including systems or human failures  are inherent in business  including ours 
we are subject to operational risks including fraud  employee errors  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obligations under our agreements  information technology failures  or external events 
losses from these risks may occur from time to time and may be significant 
as our business and operations grow more complex  we are exposed to more risk in these areas 
our modeling  underwriting and information technology systems are critical to our success 
moreover  our proprietary technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting strategy and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended 
while we have implemented disaster recovery and other business contingency plans  a defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology systems could result in reduced or delayed revenue growth  higher than expected losses  management distraction  or harm to our reputation 
we believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls and information technology systems  but internal controls provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business 
there are provisions in our charter documents that may reduce or increase the voting rights of our ordinary shares 
the bye laws of endurance holdings generally provide that any shareholder owning  directly  indirectly or  in the case of any us person  by attribution  outstanding ordinary shares possessing more than of the aggregate voting power of our ordinary shares will have their voting rights reduced so that they may not exercise more than of the voting rights conferred by our ordinary shares 
under these provisions  certain shareholders may have their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share  while other shareholders may have voting rights in excess of one vote per share 
moreover  these provisions could have the effect of reducing the votes of certain shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership 
the bye laws of endurance holdings provide that shareholders will be notified of their voting interests prior to any vote to be taken by the shareholders 
as a result of any reallocation of votes  your voting rights might increase above of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding ordinary shares  thereby possibly resulting in your becoming a reporting person subject to schedule d or g filing requirements under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
in addition  the reallocation of your votes could result in your becoming subject to filing requirements under section of the exchange act 
we also have the authority to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder s voting rights are to be reallocated pursuant to the bye laws 
if a shareholder fails to respond to a request for information from us or submits incomplete or inaccurate information after a reasonable cure period in response to a request  we may  in our reasonable discretion  reduce or eliminate the shareholder s voting rights 
provisions of endurance holdings bye laws may restrict the ability to transfer shares of endurance holdings 
endurance holdings board of directors may decline to register a transfer of any ordinary shares if the relevant instrument of transfer if any is in favor of five persons or more jointly or is not properly executed  the transferred shares are not fully paid shares or if the transferor fails to comply with all applicable laws and regulations governing the transfer 
a shareholder may be required to sell its shares of endurance 
the bye laws of endurance holdings provide that we have the option  but not the obligation  to require a shareholder to sell its ordinary shares for their fair market value to us  to other shareholders or to third parties if we determine  based on the written advice of legal counsel  that failure to exercise our option would result in non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us or certain us persons as to which the shares held by such shareholder constitute controlled shares 
in the latter case  our right to require a shareholder to sell its ordinary shares to us will be limited to the purchase of a number of ordinary shares that will permit avoidance of those adverse tax consequences 
a shareholder may be required to indemnify us for any tax liability that results from the acts of that shareholder 
the bye laws of endurance holdings provide certain protections against adverse tax consequences to us resulting from laws that apply to the shareholders of endurance holdings 
if a shareholder s death or non payment of any tax or duty payable by the shareholder  or any other act or thing involving the shareholder  causes any adverse tax consequences to us  i the shareholder or his executor or administrator is required to indemnify us against any tax liability that we incur as a result  ii we will have a lien on any dividends or any other distributions payable to the shareholder by us to the extent of the tax liability and iii if any amounts not covered by our lien on dividends and distributions are owed to us by the shareholder as a result of our tax liability  we have the right to refuse to register any transfer of the shareholder s shares 
there are regulatory limitations on the ownership and transfer of our ordinary shares 
the financial services and markets act fsma regulates the acquisition of control of any uk insurance company authorized under fsma 
any company or individual that together with its or his associates directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares of a uk authorized insurance company or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or its parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of fsma  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such authorized insurance company or its parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
a purchaser of more than of our ordinary shares would therefore be considered to have acquired control of endurance uk under the fsma  any person proposing to acquire control over a uk authorized insurance company must notify the fsa of his intention to do so and obtain the fsa s prior approval 
the fsa would then have three months to consider that person s application to acquire control 
in considering whether to approve such application  the fsa must be satisfied both that the acquirer is a fit and proper person to have such control and that the interests of consumers would not be threatened by such acquisition of control 
failure to make the relevant prior application would constitute a criminal offense 
state laws in the united states also require prior notices or regulatory agency approval of changes in control of an insurer or its holding company 
the insurance laws of the domiciliary state provide that no corporation or other person except an authorized insurer may acquire control of a domestic insurance or reinsurance company unless it has given notice to such company and obtained prior written approval of the domiciliary state insurance commissioner 
any purchaser of or more of our ordinary shares could become subject to such regulations and could be required to file certain notices and reports with the insurance commissioners of the domiciliary states of our operating companies 
us persons who own our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than us persons who are shareholders of a us corporation 
the companies act  which applies to endurance holdings and endurance bermuda  differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest  the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers 
anti takeover provisions in our bye laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors  which could diminish the value of our ordinary shares 
endurance holdings bye laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so 
in addition  these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
for example  these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our ordinary shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future 
it may be difficult to enforce service of process and enforcement of judgments against us and our officers and directors 
endurance holdings is a bermuda company and certain of its officers and directors are residents of jurisdictions outside the united states 
a substantial portion of its assets and its officers and directors  at any one time  are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or to enforce against us or our directors and officers judgments of us courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
we have been advised by appleby  our bermuda counsel  that there is no treaty in force between the united states and bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
as a result  whether a united states judgment would be enforceable in bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the us court that entered the judgment is recognized by the bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers  as determined by reference to bermuda conflict of law rules 
in addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues  the bermuda courts will not enforce a united states federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to public policy 
it is the advice of appleby that an action brought pursuant to a public or penal law  the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction  power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity  will not be entertained by a bermuda court 
certain remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including certain remedies under us federal securities laws  would not be available under bermuda law or enforceable in a bermuda court  as they would be contrary to bermuda public policy 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
risks related to taxation we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the bermuda minister of finance  under the exempted undertakings tax protection act  as amended  of bermuda  has given endurance holdings and endurance bermuda an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition any such tax will not be applicable to endurance holdings  endurance bermuda or any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  given the limited duration of the minister of finance s assurance  however  it is possible that after march  we may be subject to bermuda taxes 
we and our subsidiaries may be subject to us tax which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
endurance holdings and endurance bermuda are bermuda companies and endurance uk is an english company 
endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and endurance uk each intend to operate in such a manner that none of these companies will be deemed to be engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the united states 
nevertheless  because definitive identification of activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the united states is not provided by the code  regulations or court decisions  the internal revenue service irs might successfully contend that any of endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk are is engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
if endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk were engaged in a trade or business in the united states  and if endurance uk or endurance bermuda were to qualify for benefits under the applicable income tax treaty with the united states  but such trade or business were attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states or in the case of endurance bermuda  with respect to investment income  arguably even if such income were not attributable to a permanent establishment  endurance holdings  endurance uk and or endurance bermuda would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income that is effectively connected with the us trade or business  plus an additional branch profits tax in certain circumstances  in which case our financial condition and results of operations and your investment could be materially adversely affected 
holders of endurance holdings ordinary shares or series a preferred shares who own or more of our voting power may be subject to taxation under the controlled foreign corporation cfc rules 
certain us shareholders of a foreign corporation that is considered a controlled foreign corporation a cfc for us federal income tax purposes must include in gross income such us shareholder s pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons classification of endurance holdings  endurance uk or endurance bermuda as a controlled foreign corporation 
due to the dispersion of endurance holdings share ownership among holders  its bye law provisions that impose limitations on the concentration of voting power of its shares entitled to vote and authorize endurance holdings to purchase such shares under certain circumstances  and other factors  no us person that owns shares in endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities should be subject to treatment as a us shareholder of a cfc 
it is possible  however  that the irs could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain such a challenge 
accordingly  investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the cfc rules to an investment in endurance holdings 
us persons who hold ordinary shares or series a preferred shares may be subject to us income taxation on their pro rata share of our related party insurance income rpii 
the cfc rules apply to certain insurance and reinsurance companies that earn rpii 
if the rpii rules were to apply to endurance uk or endurance bermuda  a us person who owns ordinary shares or series a preferred shares of endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in its income for us federal income tax purposes the shareholder s pro rata share of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s rpii for the entire taxable year  determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately to such us shareholders at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed 
in addition  any rpii that is includible in the income of a us tax exempt organization would be treated as unrelated business taxable income 
although endurance uk and endurance bermuda intend to generally operate in a manner so as to qualify for certain exceptions to the rpii rules  there can be no assurance that these exceptions will be available 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that us persons who own ordinary shares or series a preferred shares will not be required to recognize gross income inclusions attributable to rpii 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons rpii companies  rpii exceptions 
the rpii rules provide that if a shareholder who is a us person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance corporation that has rpii and in which us persons collectively own or more of the shares  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder s share of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder owned the shares whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to rpii 
in addition  such a shareholder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the shareholder 
these rules should not apply to dispositions of ordinary shares or series a preferred shares because endurance holdings will not itself be directly engaged in the insurance business 
the rpii provisions  however  have not been interpreted by the courts or the us treasury department  and regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form 
accordingly  the irs might interpret the proposed regulations in a different manner and the applicable proposed regulations may be promulgated in final form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons disposition of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares  uncertainty as to the application of rpii 
us persons who hold ordinary shares or series a preferred shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered a passive foreign investment company a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
we believe that we should not be considered a pfic for us federal income purposes for the year ended december  moreover  we do not expect to conduct our activities in a manner that would cause us to become a pfic in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such challenge 
accordingly  it is possible that we could be deemed a pfic by the irs or a court for the year or any future year 
if we were considered a pfic  it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation  including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply or subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions to an insurance company 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such guidance would have on a shareholder that is subject to us federal income taxation

changes to us tax legislation could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders 
congress has discussed from time to time legislation intended to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of companies including insurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states but have certain us connections 
in particular  congress has recently conducted hearings relating to the tax treatment of offshore insurance and is reported to be considering legislation that would adversely affect reinsurance between affiliates and offshore insurance and reinsurance more generally 
on september   us rep 
richard neal introduced one such proposal  hr  a bill which provides that us insurers and reinsurers would be limited in the amount of deduction that could be claimed from reinsurance premiums ceded to offshore affiliates 
the bill  which has been referred to the house ways and means committee  would limit deductions for related party reinsurance cessions to the average percentage of premium ceded to unrelated reinsurers determined in reference to individual business lines 
other proposals relating to cross border transactions  intangible products  or non us jurisdictions generally have been introduced in a number of congressional committees 
enactment of such legislation  depending on the specific details  could adversely affect our financial results 
changes in legislation also may materially impact advantageous federal income tax rates applicable to our dividends 
under current law  our dividends should constitute qualified dividends enabling certain of our us shareholders to receive preferential federal income tax rates on such dividends received before january  see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons dividends 
the th congress proposed legislation in march that would exclude shareholders of foreign companies from this advantageous federal income tax treatment unless either i the company is organized or created in a country that has entered into a comprehensive income tax treaty with the us or ii the shares of such company are readily tradable on an established securities market in the us and the company is organized or created in a country that has a comprehensive income tax system that the us secretary of the treasury determines is satisfactory for this purpose 
while no such legislation has been introduced by the th congress  if this legislation were introduced and enacted  individual us shareholders of endurance may no longer qualify for the preferential federal income tax rates on our dividends because we may not satisfy standards as proposed or as may be proposed in the future 
the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the european union are considering measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income 
the oecd has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in the oecd s report dated april  and updated as of june and november via a global forum  bermuda was not listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
regulatory matters general the business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries  although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another 
reinsurers are generally subject to less direct regulation than primary insurers 
bermuda the insurance act of bermuda and related regulations  as amended the insurance act  regulates the insurance business of endurance bermuda and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within bermuda unless registered as an insurer by the bermuda monetary authority bma under the insurance act 
endurance bermuda is registered as a class insurer by the bma 
as a holding company  endurance holdings is not subject to bermuda insurance regulations 
insurance  as well as reinsurance  is regulated under the insurance act 
the bma  in deciding whether to grant registration  has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest 
the bma is required by the insurance act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and  in particular  whether a it has fulfilled the minimum criteria with respect to the body corporate  b it has  or has available to it  adequate knowledge and expertise to operate an insurance business and c the premises intended to be used in the business are adequate for the conduct of the business 
the continued registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to it complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the bma may impose from time to time 
an insurance advisory committee appointed by the bermuda minister of finance the minister advises the bma on matters connected with the discharge of the bma s functions 
sub committees of the insurance advisory committee supervise and review the law and practice of insurance in bermuda  including reviews of accounting and administrative procedures 
the day to day supervision of insurers is the responsibility of the bma 
the insurance act also imposes on bermuda insurance companies solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and grants the bma powers to supervise  investigate  require information and the production of documents and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
certain significant aspects of the bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below 
in july  the insurance amendment act the amendment act was promulgated  which among other things  created a new supervisory framework for bermuda insurers by establishing new risk based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin requirements 
the implementation of the new supervisory framework is to occur in phases  commencing with class insurers before being extended to certain commercial class  class a and class b insurers 
under the new regulatory framework ushered in by the amendment act on december   the bma promulgated the insurance prudential standards class solvency requirement order the order which  inter alia  mandates that a class insurer s enhanced capital requirement ecr be calculated by either a the model set out in schedule to the order or b an internal capital model which the bma has approved for use for this purpose 
more information on the ecr and the new risk based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin regime introduced under the amendment act can be found in the section entitled enhanced capital requirement  minimum solvency margin and restrictions on dividends and distributions 
on december   the bermuda house of assembly approved amendments to bermuda s existing insurance regulations the regulations 
the amended regulations  which came into effect on december  compliment and in certain respects  are consequential to the changes instituted under the amendment act 
the bma utilizes a risk based approach when it comes to licensing and supervising insurance companies in bermuda 
as part of the bma s risk based system  an assessment of the inherent risks within each particular class of insurer is utilized in the first instance to determine the limitations and specific requirements which may be imposed 
thereafter  the bma keeps its analysis of relative risk within individual institutions under review on an ongoing basis  including through the scrutiny of regular audited statutory financial statements  and  as appropriate  meeting with senior management during onsite visits 
the initial meetings with senior management and any proposed onsite visit will primarily focus upon companies that are licensed as class and class insurers 
the bma has also recently adopted guidance notes  or the guidance notes  in order to ensure those operating in bermuda have a good understanding of the nature of the requirements of  and the bma s approach in implementing  the insurance act 
classification of insurers the insurance act distinguishes between insurers carrying on long term business and insurers carrying on general business 
there are six classifications of insurers carrying on general business  with class insurers subject to the strictest regulation 
endurance bermuda  which is incorporated to carry on general insurance and reinsurance business  is registered as a class insurer in bermuda and is regulated as such under the insurance act 
endurance bermuda is not licensed to carry on long term business 
cancellation of insurer s registration an insurer s registration may be canceled by the supervisor of insurance of the bma on certain grounds specified in the insurance act  including failure of the insurer to comply with its obligations under the insurance act or if  in the opinion of the bma after consultation with the insurance advisory committee  the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles 
principal representative an insurer is required to maintain a principal office in bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in bermuda 
for the purpose of the insurance act  endurance bermuda s principal office is its executive offices in pembroke  bermuda 
michael j 
mcguire has been appointed by the board of directors as endurance bermuda s principal representative and has been approved by the bma 
without a reason acceptable to the bma  an insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal representative  and the principal representative may not cease to act as such  unless days notice in writing to bma is given of the intention to do so 
a principal representative shall forthwith notify the bma  in such a manner as it may direct  a on his reaching a view that there is a likelihood of the insurer for which he acts becoming insolvent  for instance the failure by the insurer to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon the insurer by the bma relating to a solvency margin or liquidity or other ratio would be a reportable event  b on its coming to his knowledge  or his having reason to believe  that an event to which the applicable section of the insurance act applies has occurred  under the amendment act these events now include i circumstances where a class insurer undergoes a material change to the nature of the business it underwrites  and ii a significant loss which is likely to render the insurer unable to comply with its ecr 
within days of such notification  the principal representative shall furnish the bma with a report in writing setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to him 
independent approved auditor every registered insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will audit and report annually on the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return of the insurer  both of which  in the case of endurance bermuda  are required to be filed annually with the bma 
endurance bermuda s independent auditor must be approved by the bma and may be the same person or firm that audits endurance holdings consolidated financial statements and reports for presentation to its shareholders 
loss reserve specialist as a registered class insurer  endurance bermuda is required to submit an opinion of its approved loss reserve specialist with its statutory financial return in respect of its losses and loss expenses provisions 
the loss reserve specialist  who will normally be a qualified casualty actuary  must be approved by the bma 
michael e 
angelina  chief actuary and chief risk officer for the company  has been appointed by our board of directors and has been approved by the bma to act as endurance bermuda s loss reserve specialist 
statutory and gaap financial statements an insurer must prepare annual statutory financial statements 
the insurance act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of these statutory financial statements which include  in statutory form  a balance sheet  an income statement  a statement of capital and surplus and notes thereto 
the insurer is required to give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums  claims  reinsurance and investments 
the amendment act and amended regulations have introduced a new accounts regime applicable to class insurers  including i a distinct methodology and new format to be applied when preparing and reporting the statutory balance sheet and statutory income statements for class insurers and ii accompanying explanatory notes to be added and instructions affecting each statutory statement 
the most significant aspect of the amended regulations in relation to the statutory balance sheet of class insurers is the reporting obligation to detail  on a line by line basis  specific asset and liability classes  as well as the requirement to identify and distinguish between what is or is not attributable to affiliates of the class insurer 
with effect from december   class insurers are required to prepare and file with the bma audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap that applies in bermuda  uk  uk  or such other gaap as the bma may recognize or international financial reporting standards ifrs 
these statements are to be submitted within four months from the end of the financial year to which they relate or  if the class insurer makes an application to the bma  such longer period as may be allowed by the bma but no longer than seven months from the end of the financial year to which they relate 
the bma will publish each such class insurer s gaap or ifrs audited financial statements 
the statutory financial statements are not prepared in accordance with us gaap and are distinct from the financial statements prepared for presentation to the insurer s shareholders under the companies act  which financial statements  in the case of the company  will be prepared in accordance with us gaap 
as a general business insurer  endurance bermuda is required to submit the annual statutory financial statements as part of the annual statutory financial return 
the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by bma 
in addition to statutory financial statements  class insures are required to file audited gaap financial statements with the bma to be published publicly 
the audited gaap financial statements are to be filed with the annual statutory financial return 
annual statutory financial return endurance bermuda is required to file with the bma a statutory financial return no later than four months after its financial year end unless specifically extended upon application to the bma 
the statutory financial return for a class insurer includes  among other matters  a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of the insurer  solvency certificates  the statutory financial statements  the opinion of the loss reserve specialist and a schedule of reinsurance ceded 
the solvency certificates must be signed by the principal representative and at least two directors of the insurer certifying that the minimum solvency margin has been met and whether the insurer complied with the conditions attached to its certificate of registration 
the independent auditor is required to state whether  in its opinion  it was reasonable for the directors to make these certifications and whether the declaration of the statutory ratios complies with the requirements of the insurance act 
if an insurer s accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the insurance act  a statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return 
enhanced capital requirement  minimum solvency margin and restrictions on dividends and distributions the new risk based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin regime introduced under the amendment act  which came into effect on december   provides a risk based capital model as a tool to assist the bma both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization termed the bermuda solvency capital requirement bscr 
bscr employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by bermuda insurers to the capital that is dedicated to their business 
the framework that has been developed and is set out in the order  published on december   applies a standard measurement format to the risk associated with an insurer s assets  liabilities and premiums  including a formula to take account of the catastrophe risk exposure 
where the insurer believes that its own internal model for measuring risk and determining appropriate levels of capital better reflects the inherent risk of its business  it may make application to the bma for approval to use its internal capital model in substitution for the bscr model 
the bma may approve an insurer s internal model provided certain conditions have been established and may revoke approval of an internal model in the event that the conditions are no longer met or where it feels that the revocation is appropriate 
the bma will review the internal model regularly to confirm that the model continues to meet the conditions 
in order to minimise the risk of a shortfall in capital arising from an unexpected adverse deviation and in moving towards the implementation of a risk based capital approach  the bma seeks that insurers operate at or above a threshold capital level termed the target capital level tcl  which exceeds the bscr or approved internal model minimum amounts 
the amendment act also introduced prudential standards in relation to the ecr and capital and solvency return csr 
the ecr is determined using the bscr or an approved internal model  provided that at all times the ecr must be an amount equal to  or exceeding the minimum margin of solvency 
the csr is the return setting out the insurers risk management practises and other information used by the insurer to calculate its approved internal model ecr 
the new capital requirements require class insurers to hold available statutory capital and surplus equal to or exceeding ecr and set tcl at of ecr 
the bma also has a degree of discretion enabling it to impose ecr on insurers in particular cases  for instance where an insurer falls below the tcl 
in those cases  the new risk based capital model should be supplemented by a requirement for the affected insurers to conduct certain stress and scenario testing in order to assess their potential vulnerability to defined extreme events 
where the results of scenario and stress testing indicated potential capital vulnerability  the bma would be able to require a higher solvency cushion by increasing the tcl figure 
in circumstances where an insurer has failed to comply with an ecr given by the bma in respect of that insurer  such insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends until the failure is rectified and the insurer is obliged to i provide the bma  within fourteen days of the failure  with a written report as to why the failure occurred and remedial steps to be taken  and ii within forty five days of the failure to provide the bma with unaudited interim financial statements 
the opinion of the loss reserve specialist  a general business solvency certificate in respect of the unaudited financials and a csr reflecting an ecr prepared using post failure data 
underlying the new risk based solvency capital regime described above is the minimum solvency margin test set out in the insurance returns and solvency amendment regulations as amended 
while it must calculate its ecr annually by reference to either the bscr or an approved internal model  a class insurer such as endurance bermuda must also ensure that  at all times  its ecr is at least equal to the minimum solvency margin for a class insurer in respect of its general business  which is the greater of of net premiums written being gross premiums written less any reinsurance premiums ceded not exceeding of gross premiums written  of net loss and loss expense provisions and other general business insurance reserves 
in addition  under the insurance act  class insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus  as shown on its previous financial year statutory balance sheet  unless at least seven days before payment of the dividends it files with the bma an affidavit that it will continue to meet its required solvency margins 
endurance bermuda as a class insurer must obtain the bma s prior approval before reducing its total statutory capital  as shown on its previous financial year statutory balance sheet  by or more 
furthermore  under the companies act  endurance holdings and endurance bermuda may only declare or pay a dividend if endurance holdings or endurance bermuda  as the case may be  has no reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or if the realizable value of its assets would not be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
minimum liquidity ratio the insurance act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business insurers  like endurance bermuda 
an insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than of the amount of its relevant liabilities 
relevant assets include  but are not limited to  cash and time deposits  quoted investments  unquoted bonds and debentures  first liens on real estate  investment income due and accrued  accounts and premiums receivable  reinsurance balances receivable and funds held by ceding reinsurers 
there are certain categories of assets which  unless specifically permitted by the bma  do not automatically qualify as relevant assets  such as unquoted equity securities  investments in and advances to affiliates and real estate and collateral loans 
the relevant liabilities are total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities less deferred income tax and sundry liabilities by interpretation  those not specifically defined  letters of credit and guarantees 
supervision  investigation and intervention the bma may appoint an inspector with extensive powers to investigate the affairs of endurance bermuda if the bma believes that such an investigation is in the best interests of its policyholders or persons who may become policyholders 
in order to verify or supplement information otherwise provided to the bma  the bma may direct endurance bermuda to produce documents or information relating to matters connected with its business 
in addition  the bma has the power to require the production of documents from any person who appears to be in possession of such documents 
further  the bma has the power  in respect of a person registered under the insurance act  to appoint a professional person to prepare a report on any aspect of any matter about which the bma has required or could require information 
if it appears to the bma to be desirable in the interests of the clients of a person registered under the insurance act  the bma may also exercise these powers in relation to any company which is or has at any relevant time been a a parent company  subsidiary company or related company of that registered person  b a subsidiary company of a parent company of that registered person  c a parent company of a subsidiary company of that registered person or d a company in the case of which a shareholder controller of that registered person  either alone or with any associate or associates  holds percent or more of the shares or is entitled to exercise  or control the exercise  of more than percent of the voting power at a general meeting 
if it appears to the bma that there is a risk of endurance bermuda becoming insolvent  or that endurance bermuda is in breach of the insurance act or any conditions imposed upon its registration  the bma may  among other things  direct endurance bermuda i not to effect further contracts of insurance  or any contract of insurance of a specified description  ii to limit the aggregate of the premiums to be written by it during a specified period beginning not earlier than days after the direction is given  iii not to vary any contract of insurance in force when the direction is given  if the effect of the variation would be to increase the liabilities of the insurer  iv not to make any investment of a specified class  v before the expiration of a specified period or such longer period as the bma may allow to realize any existing investment of a specified class  vi not to declare or pay any dividends or any other distributions  or to restrict the making of such payments to such extent as the bma thinks fit  vii not to enter into any specified transaction with any specified person or persons of a specified class  viii to provide such written particulars relating to the financial circumstances of the insurer as the bma thinks fit  and ix to obtain the opinion of a loss reserve specialist with respect to general business  or an actuarial opinion with respect to long term business  and to submit it to the bma within a specified time 
disclosure of information in addition to powers under the insurance act to investigate the affairs of an insurer  the bma may require certain information from an insurer or certain other persons to be produced to them 
further  the bma has been given powers to assist other regulatory authorities  including foreign insurance regulatory authorities  with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in bermuda but subject to restrictions 
for example  the bma must be satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities of the foreign regulatory authority 
further  the bma must consider whether cooperation is in the public interest 
the grounds for disclosure are limited and the insurance act provides sanctions for breach of the statutory duty of confidentiality 
under the companies act  the minister has been given powers to assist a foreign regulatory authority which has requested assistance in connection with enquiries being carried out by it in the performance of its regulatory functions 
the minister s powers include requiring a person to furnish him with information  to produce documents to him  to attend and answer questions and to give assistance in connection with enquiries 
the minister must be satisfied that the assistance requested by the foreign regulatory authority is for the purpose of its regulatory functions and that the request is in relation to information in bermuda which a person has in his possession or under his control 
the minister must consider  among other things  whether it is in the public interest to give the information sought 
bermuda guidance notes the bma has issued guidance notes on the application of the insurance act in respect of the duties  requirements and standards to be complied with by persons registered under the insurance act or otherwise regulated under it and the procedures and sound principles to be observed by such persons and by auditors  principal representatives and loss reserve specialists

certain other bermuda law considerations endurance holdings and endurance bermuda will each also need to comply with the provisions of the companies act regulating the payment of dividends and making of distributions from contributed surplus 
a company is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend  or making a distribution out of contributed surplus  if there are reasonable grounds for believing that a the company is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or b the realizable value of the company s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
although endurance bermuda is incorporated in bermuda  it is classified as a non resident of bermuda for exchange control purposes by the bma

securities may be offered or sold in bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the investment business act  and exchange control act  and related regulations of bermuda which regulate the sale of securities in bermuda 
in addition  specific permission is required from the bma  pursuant to the provisions of the exchange control act and related regulations  for all issuances and transfers of securities of bermuda companies  other than in cases where the bma has granted a general permission 
the bma  in its policy dated june   provides that where any equity securities  which would include our ordinary shares  of a bermuda company are listed on an appointed stock exchange the new york stock exchange is deemed to be an appointed stock exchange under bermuda law  general permission is given for the issue and subsequent transfer of any securities of a company from and or to a non resident  for as long as any equity securities of the company remain so listed

uk regulation general on december   the financial services authority fsa assumed its full powers and responsibilities as the single statutory regulator responsible for regulating the financial services industry in respect of the carrying on of regulated activities including deposit taking  insurance  investment management and most other financial services business by way of business in the uk  with the purpose of maintaining confidence in the uk financial system  providing public understanding of the system  securing the proper degree of protection for consumers and helping to reduce financial crime 
it is a criminal offense for any person to carry on a regulated activity in the uk unless that person is authorized by the fsa and has been granted permission to carry on that regulated activity or falls under an exemption 
insurance business which includes reinsurance business is authorized and supervised by the fsa 
insurance business in the united kingdom is divided between two main categories long term insurance which is primarily investment related and general insurance 
it is not possible for an insurance company to be authorized in both long term and general insurance business 
these two categories are both divided into classes for example permanent health and pension fund management are two classes of long term insurance  damage to property and motor vehicle liability are two classes of general insurance 
under the financial services and markets act the fsma  effecting or carrying out contracts of insurance  within a class of general or long term insurance  by way of business in the united kingdom  constitutes a regulated activity requiring individual authorization 
an authorized insurance company must have permission for each class of insurance business it intends to write 
endurance uk has received authorization from the fsa to effect and carry out in the united kingdom contracts of insurance in all classes of general business limited in the case of credit and surety to reinsurance only except legal expenses and assistance business 
on january   as a result of the implementation by the united kingdom government of the insurance mediation directive ec various additional activities  which had previously been unregulated  fell within the scope of fsa regulation 
endurance uk has accordingly received authorization from the fsa to conduct the following additional regulated activities arranging bringing about deals in investments and making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments 
in both cases  those activities are restricted to non investment insurance contracts 
endurance uk is also authorized to accept deposits limited to accepting deposits in the course of carrying on insurance business for which it holds permission 
as an authorized insurer in the united kingdom  endurance uk would be able to operate throughout the eu  subject to certain regulatory requirements of the fsa and in some cases  certain local regulatory requirements 
an insurance company with fsa authorization to write insurance business in the united kingdom can seek consent from the fsa to allow it to provide cross border services in other member states of the eu as an alternative  fsa consent may be obtained to establish a branch office within another member state 
as an fsa authorized insurer  the insurance and reinsurance businesses of endurance uk are subject to close supervision by the fsa 
the fsa has implemented specific requirements for senior management arrangements  systems and controls of insurance and reinsurance companies under its jurisdiction  which place a strong emphasis on risk identification and management in relation to the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance business in the united kingdom 
in december  the fsa prompted a market initiative in the united kingdom insurance industry to resolve perceived problems resulting from contract uncertainty  which may exist where the full terms and conditions of a contract of insurance or reinsurance are not established at or before the time when the contract comes into force 
the fsa s stated preferred outcome was that a market solution should be produced which met the regulator s main concerns  which were that policyholders should know precisely what protection they have bought  and that insurers  reinsurers and brokers should have a clearer view  at the time of inception of a contract of the relevant legal  fiduciary  operational and underwriting risks to which they are subject 
on january   the fsa announced that the insurance industry had met the challenge laid down by the regulator to achieve a solution to contract certainty in the united kingdom 
accordingly  the current publicly stated position of the fsa is that it does not  at present  intend to propose new rules to address the contract certainty issue 
however  the fsa also stated that contract certainty would continue to be a supervisory priority in and that  in those cases where it believes that firms have fallen behind the rest of the market in reducing the number of contracts that do not meet the market s contract certainty standards  it would consider regulatory action to address this  though no enforcement action has been taken in this regard to date 
this action might include increases in required regulatory capital or the commencement of enforcement action 
in december  the fsa published its new insurance conduct of business sourcebook icobs which sets out the standards of the requirements for general insurance firms on how they deal with their customers 
the new general insurance regime came into effect on january  with firms being allowed a six month transitional period for implementation 
all firms are expected to have met the requested standards by july  icobs continues the fsa s move to more principles based regulation 
supervision the fsa carries out the prudential supervision of insurance companies through a variety of methods  including the collection of information from statistical returns  review of accountants reports  visits to insurance companies and regular formal interviews 
the fsa has adopted a risk based approach to the supervision of insurance companies 
under this approach the fsa performs a formal risk assessment of insurance companies or groups carrying on business in the uk periodically  which varies in length according to the risk profile of the insurer 
the fsa performs the risk assessment by analyzing information which it receives during the normal course of its supervision  such as regular prudential returns on the financial position of the insurance company  or which it acquires through a series of meetings with senior management of the insurance company 
after each risk assessment  the fsa will inform the insurer of its views on the insurer s risk profile 
this will include details of any remedial action that the fsa requires and the likely consequences if this action is not taken 
solvency requirements the fsa s general prudential sourcebook and prudential sourcebook for insurers together  the prudential sourcebooks require that insurance companies maintain a margin of solvency at all times in respect of any general insurance undertaken by the insurance company  the calculation of which in any particular case depends on the type and amount of insurance business a company writes 
the method of calculation of the solvency margin is set out in the prudential sourcebooks  and for these purposes  all insurer s assets and liabilities are subject to specific valuation rules which are set out in the prudential sourcebooks 
failure to maintain the required solvency margin is one of the grounds on which wide powers of intervention conferred upon the fsa may be exercised 
for financial years ending on or after january   the calculation of the required margin of solvency has been amended as a result of the implementation of the eu solvency i directives 
in respect of liability business accepted  of the actual premiums written and claims incurred must be included in the calculation  which has had the effect of increasing the required minimum margin of solvency of endurance uk 
endurance uk continuously monitors its solvency capital position and maintains capital in excess of the required minimum margin of solvency 
each insurance company writing various classes of business is also required by the prudential sourcebooks to maintain equalization provisions calculated in accordance with the provisions of the prudential sourcebook for insurers 
insurers are required to calculate an enhanced capital requirement ecr in addition to their required minimum solvency margin and to report it to the fsa though the ecr is not part of the formal capital requirements under the prudential sourcebooks 
this represents a more risk based calculation than the statutory solvency margin requirements derived from the eu directives 
there is also a requirement for insurers to maintain financial resources which are adequate  both as to amount and quality  to ensure that there is no significant risk that its liabilities cannot be met as they come due 
in order to carry out the assessment as to the necessary financial resources that are required  an insurer is required to identify the major sources of risk to its ability to meet its liabilities as they come due  and to carry out stress and scenario tests to identify an appropriate range of realistic adverse scenarios in which the risk crystallizes and to estimate the financial resources needed in each of the circumstances and events identified 
in addition  the fsa gives individual capital guidance icg regularly to insurers and reinsurers following receipt of individual capital assessments  prepared by firms themselves 
the fsa s guidance may be that a company should hold more or less than its then current level of regulatory capital  or that the company s regulatory capital should remain unaltered 
endurance uk has submitted an individual capital assessment solvency calculation to the fsa and has agreed with the fsa the bases and methodology for this calculation 
this calculation is used along with other tools by the fsa to help establish the icg 
endurance uk is currently calculating the ecr for december  should endurance uk not meet this test  additional capital may be required 
in addition  an insurer other than a pure reinsurer that is part of a group  is required to perform and submit to the fsa a solvency margin calculation return in respect of its ultimate parent undertaking  in accordance with the fsa s rules 
this return is not part of an insurer s own solvency return and hence will not be publicly available 
although there is no requirement for the parent undertaking solvency calculation to show a positive result  the fsa may take action where it considers that the solvency of the insurance company is or may be jeopardized due to the group solvency position 
further  an insurer is required to report in its annual returns to the fsa all material related party transactions eg  intra group reinsurance  whose value is more than of the insurer s general insurance business amount 
the european commission  jointly with member states  is carrying out a fundamental review of the regulatory capital and supervisory regime of the insurance industry the solvency ii project 
its objective is to establish a solvency system that is better matched to the true risks of insurers enabling supervisors to protect policyholders interests as effectively as possible and in accordance with common principles across the eu 
endurance uk is monitoring the ongoing consultation following publication of the solvency ii framework directive the solvency ii directive 
the legislation implementing the final version of the solvency ii directive is not likely to take effect in the uk until at the earliest october  though in march the fsa intends to ask insurers about their current implementation planning and progress made towards complying with the requirements of the solvency ii directive 
endurance uk intends to fully co operate with the fsa in this respect 
restrictions on dividend payments uk company law prohibits endurance uk from declaring a dividend to its shareholders unless it has profits available for distribution 
the determination of whether a company has profits available for distribution is based on its accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses 
while the united kingdom insurance regulatory laws impose no statutory restrictions on a general insurer s ability to declare a dividend  the fsa strictly controls the maintenance of each insurance company s solvency margin within its jurisdiction 
the fsa s rules require endurance uk to notify the fsa of any proposed or actual payment of a dividend 
any such payment or proposal could result in regulatory intervention 
in addition  the fsa requires authorized insurance companies to notify the fsa in advance of any significant dividend payment 
reporting requirements uk insurance companies must prepare their financial statements under the companies act of as amended  which requires the filing with companies house of audited financial statements and related reports 
in addition  uk insurance companies are required to file with the fsa regulatory returns  which include a revenue account  a profit and loss account and a balance sheet in prescribed forms 
under the interim prudential sourcebook for insurers  audited regulatory returns must be filed with the fsa within two months and days or three months where the delivery of the return is made electronically 
supervision of management the fsa closely supervises the management of insurance companies through the approved persons regime  by which any appointment of persons to perform certain specified controlled functions within a regulated entity  must be approved by the fsa 
change of control the financial services market act the fsma regulates the acquisition of control of any uk insurance company authorized under the fsma 
any company or individual that together with its or his associates directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in a uk authorized insurance company or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or its parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such authorized insurance company or its parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
a purchaser of or more of the ordinary shares would therefore be considered to have acquired control of endurance uk under the fsma  any person proposing to acquire control over a uk authorized insurance company must give prior notification to the fsa of his intention to do so 
the fsa would then have three months to consider that person s application to acquire control 
in considering whether to approve such application  the fsa must be satisfied that both the acquirer is a fit and proper person to have such control and that the interests of consumers would not be threatened by such acquisition of control 
failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against the company by the fsa 
as of march  the above provisions governing changes of control will be amended through the implementation of the eu acquisitions directive 
a number of changes to the existing provisions are to be made  including potentially broad new requirements to aggregate the voting rights and or capital held by persons acting in concert  in relation to the time period given to the fsa for approving an application to acquire control  with the fsa then having working days to make a decision following its acknowledgement of the application 
the duration of this period may be stopped by the fsa once  to request further information  for a maximum of days days for non eu applicants 
although the fsa may make further information requests  this does not stop the clock  meaning that the fsa has a maximum of working days to consider an application from an eu applicant for a non eu applicant 
intervention and enforcement the fsa has extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of an authorized person  culminating in the ultimate sanction of the removal of authorization to carry on a regulated activity 
fsma imposes on the fsa statutory obligations to monitor compliance with the requirements imposed by fsma  and to enforce the provisions of fsma related rules made by the fsa 
the fsa has power  among other things  to enforce and take disciplinary measures in respect of breaches of both the prudential sourcebooks and breaches of the conduct of business rules generally applicable to authorized persons 
the fsa also has the power to prosecute criminal offences arising under fsma  and to prosecute insider dealing under part v of the criminal justice act of  and breaches of money laundering regulations 
the fsa s stated policy is to pursue criminal prosecution in all appropriate cases 
passporting european union directives allow endurance uk to conduct business in european union states other than the united kingdom in compliance with the scope of permission granted these companies by the fsa without the necessity of additional licensing or authorization in other european union jurisdictions 
this ability to operate in other jurisdictions of the european union on the basis of home state authorization and supervision is sometimes referred to as passporting 
insurers may operate outside their home member state either on a services basis or on an establishment basis 
operating on a services basis means that the company conducts permitted businesses in the host state without having a physical presence there  while operating on an establishment basis means the company has a branch or physical presence in the host state 
in both cases  a company remains subject to regulation by its home regulator  and not by local regulatory authorities  although the company nonetheless may have to comply with certain local rules reserved to the host state the state into which the services are being provided or in which the branch is being established 
in addition to european union member states  norway  iceland and liechtenstein members of the broader european economic area are jurisdictions in which this passporting framework applies 
us regulation endurance us reinsurance was organized under the laws of new york on september  on december   endurance us reinsurance received a license to write certain lines of insurance and reinsurance business from the new york state insurance department 
on august   endurance us reinsurance acquired endurance american specialty insurance company  a delaware insurance company  which transacts business on a surplus lines basis 
on june   endurance us reinsurance acquired endurance american insurance company  a delaware insurance company  which transacts business on an admitted basis 
on june   endurance us reinsurance acquired american merchants casualty company  an ohio insurance company that was subsequently redomesticated to delaware  which transacts business on a surplus lines basis 
on december   endurance us holdings corp 
acquired american agri business insurance company and armtech insurance services  inc  each a texas company 
on january   endurance reinsurance corporation of america completed its redomestication from new york to delaware and is currently regulated by the delaware department of insurance 
insurance holding company regulation of endurance holdings endurance holdings and endurance us holdings corp  as parent companies of the company s us operating companies  are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the states of delaware and texas  the states in which the company s us operating subsidiaries are organized and domiciled 
these laws generally require  among other things  the insurance holding company and each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance departments of their respective domiciliary states and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system 
generally  all material transactions among companies in the holding company system involving the company s us operating subsidiaries  including sales  loans  reinsurance agreements  service agreements  dividend payments and certain transactions within the insurance holding company system must be fair and  if material or of a specified category  require prior notice and approval or non disapproval by the insurance regulator of the state in which the involved us operating subsidiary is domiciled 
changes of control before a person can acquire control of a us domestic insurer or reinsurer  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the insurer or reinsurer is domiciled  or the acquiror must make a disclaimer of control filing with the insurance department of such state 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer or reinsurer  the domiciliary state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the proposed acquiror  the integrity and management of the acquiror s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control 
generally  state insurance statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  ten percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer 
because a person acquiring ten percent or more of endurance holdings ordinary shares would indirectly acquire the same percentage of common stock of endurance holdings us operating subsidiaries  the us insurance change of control laws will likely apply to such a transaction 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of endurance holdings  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of the shareholders of endurance holdings might consider to be desirable 
state insurance regulation of the company s us operating subsidiaries the terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any us state insurance department with respect to rates or policy terms unlike primary insurance agreements  the rates and policy terms of which are generally closely regulated by state insurance departments 
as a practical matter  however  the rates charged by primary insurers do have an effect on the rates that can be charged by reinsurers 
state insurance authorities have broad regulatory powers with respect to various aspects of the business of endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty  american merchants and armtech including licensing to transact business  admittance of assets to statutory surplus  regulating unfair trade and claims practices  establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards including risk based capital standards  approval of policy forms and dates  and regulating investments  dividends and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates 
with respect to direct insurance business  states may also regulate rates and forms used by insurers admitted to transact business within a given state jurisdiction 
state insurance laws and regulations require each of endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty  american merchants to file financial statements with insurance departments everywhere it is licensed  authorized or accredited to conduct insurance business  and the operations of endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty  american merchants and armtech are subject to examination by those departments at any time 
endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty  american merchants and armtech prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the books and records  financial reporting  policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled or authorized to transact business in their states  generally once every three to five years 
examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the naic 
in general  such state regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders 
under delaware and texas insurance laws  endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty  american merchants and armtech may only pay dividends to their respective parent companies out of earned surplus 
in delaware and texas  earned surplus is defined as an amount equal to the unassigned funds of an insurer as set forth in the most recent annual statement of the insurer submitted to the applicable state insurance regulator  including all or part of the surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets 
in addition  the ability of endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty  american merchants and armtech to declare or pay any dividend  together with all dividends declared or distributed by it within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of ten percent of its policyholders surplus as of the st day of december of the preceding year  or the statutory net income  not including realized capital gains for the month period ending  for the preceding calendar year the st day of december next preceding will be subject to the prior approval of the applicable state insurance regulator 
any dividend paid by endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty  american merchants and armtech must first be paid to its parent company 
if the parent company is also an insurer  as is the case with endurance american  endurance american specialty and american merchants  the parent company or companies must also meet their own dividend eligibility requirements set forth above in order to pass along any dividends received from subsidiary insurance companies 
the dividend limitations imposed by delaware and texas insurance laws are based on the statutory financial results of the company s us operating subsidiaries determined by using statutory accounting practices which differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the significant differences relate to deferred acquisition expenses  deferred income taxes  required investment reserves  reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes 
at december   of the company s us operating subsidiaries  only american merchants and armtech had earned surplus  and therefore  only american merchants and armtech could declare or distribute a dividend in without prior regulatory approval 
while the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business other than for flood  nuclear and reinsurance of losses from terrorism  federal legislation and administrative policies can affect the insurance industry 
the federal government has also undertaken initiatives in several areas that may impact the insurance industry including tort reform  corporate governance and the taxation of insurance companies 
in addition  legislation has been introduced from time to time in recent years that  if enacted  could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in the regulation of the insurance industry  primarily as respects federal licensing in lieu of state licensing 
risk based capital regulations the insurance laws of delaware and texas require that insurers report their risk based capital rbc based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset  premium and reserve items 
the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
the state insurance departments of delaware and texas use the formula only as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possibly inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
insurance laws impose broad confidentiality requirements on those engaged in the insurance business including insurers  agents  brokers and others and on the state insurance departments as to the use and publication of rbc data 
the insurance departments of delaware and texas have explicit regulatory authority to require various actions by  or take various actions against  insurers whose total adjusted capital does not exceed certain rbc levels 
statutory accounting practices statutory accounting practices  or sap  are a basis of accounting developed to assist us insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies 
it is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s surplus to policyholders 
accordingly  statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state 
us gaap concerns an insurer s solvency  but it also concerns other financial measurements  such as income and cash flows 
accordingly  us gaap gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does sap 
as a direct result  different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap as opposed to sap 
statutory accounting practices established by the naic and adopted  in part  by the delaware and texas insurance regulators  determine  among other things  the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of endurance holdings us insurance company subsidiaries and thus determine  in part  the amount of funds they have available to pay dividends to their respective parent companies 
operations of endurance uk and endurance bermuda endurance uk and endurance bermuda are not admitted to do business in any state in the united states 
insurance laws of each state of the united states and of many other countries restrict or prohibit the sale of insurance and reinsurance within their jurisdictions by non admitted alien insurers and reinsurers such as endurance uk and endurance bermuda 
in addition to the regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed  reinsurers business operations are affected by regulatory requirements in various states of the united states governing credit for reinsurance which are imposed on their ceding companies 
in general  a ceding company that obtains reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed  accredited or approved by the jurisdiction or state in which the reinsurer files statutory financial statements is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the liability for unearned premiums which are that portion of written premiums which applies to the remaining portion of the policy period and loss reserves and loss expense reserves ceded to the reinsurer 
as stated above  endurance uk and endurance bermuda are not licensed  accredited or approved in any state in the united states 
the great majority of states  however  permit a credit to statutory surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non licensed or non accredited reinsurer to be offset to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit or other acceptable security arrangement 
a few states do not allow credit for reinsurance ceded to non licensed or non accredited reinsurers except in certain limited circumstances and others impose additional requirements that make it difficult to become accredited 
we do not believe that endurance uk and endurance bermuda are in violation of insurance laws of any jurisdiction in the united states 
there can be no assurance however  that inquiries or challenges to endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s insurance or reinsurance activities will not be raised in the future 
switzerland in  endurance bermuda established a branch in zurich  switzerland named endurance specialty insurance ltd 
pembroke bermuda zurich branch 
the swiss financial regulator does not impose additional regulation upon a branch of an authorized reinsurer 
on january   the federal act on the swiss financial market supervisory authority finma  which the swiss parliament approved in june  went into full legal force 
the effect of the act was to merge three bodies the federal office of private insurance  the swiss federal banking commission and the anti money laundering control authority into finma 
until their merger and incorporation into finma  these three authorities retained responsibility for their own areas of activity 
singapore in  endurance specialty insurance ltd  singapore branch received regulatory approval from the monetary authority of singapore to operate as a branch insurer in singapore to transact insurance and reinsurance domestically and internationally 
the branch is regulated by the monetary authority of singapore pursuant to the insurance act

material tax considerations certain bermuda tax considerations currently  there is no bermuda income  corporation or profits tax  withholding tax  capital gains tax  capital transfer tax  estate duty or inheritance tax payable by us or our shareholders  other than shareholders ordinarily resident in bermuda  if any 
currently  there is no bermuda withholding or other tax on principal interest or dividends paid to holders of the ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  other than holders ordinarily resident in bermuda  if any 
there can be no assurance that we or our shareholders will not be subject to any such tax in the future 
endurance bermuda has received written assurance dated december  and endurance holdings has received written assurance dated july  from the minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda  as amended  that if there is enacted in bermuda any legislation imposing tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of that tax would not be applicable to endurance bermuda or endurance holdings or to any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or obligations until march   provided  that the assurance is subject to the condition that it will not be construed to prevent the application of such tax to people ordinarily resident in bermuda  or to prevent the application of any taxes payable by endurance bermuda or endurance holdings in respect of real property or leasehold interests in bermuda held by them 
to date  the ministry of finance has given no indication that the ministry i would not extend the term of the assurance beyond  or ii would allow the term of the assurance to expire  or iii would change the tax treatment afforded to exempted companies either before or after certain united kingdom tax considerations endurance uk is a company incorporated in the united kingdom and is resident in the united kingdom for united kingdom corporation tax purposes and will be subject to united kingdom corporation tax on its worldwide profits 
the current rate of united kingdom corporation tax is generally on profits of whatever description 
currently  no united kingdom withholding tax applies to dividends paid by endurance uk certain united states federal income tax considerations the following discussion is a summary of certain us federal income tax considerations relating to endurance holdings and its operating subsidiaries in bermuda  the united states and the united kingdom and the ownership of our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
this summary is based upon the code  the regulations promulgated thereunder  rulings and other administrative pronouncements issued by the irs  judicial decisions  the tax treaty between the united states and bermuda the bermuda treaty and the tax treaty between the united states and the united kingdom the uk treaty  all as currently in effect  and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change  possibly with retroactive effect 
no assurance can be given that the irs would assert  or that a court would not sustain  a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below 
no advance ruling has been or will be sought from the irs regarding any matter discussed in this annual report on form k 
this summary is for general information only  and does not purport to discuss all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light of such investor s investment or tax circumstances  or to investors subject to special tax rules  such as tax exempt organizations  dealers in securities  banks  insurance companies  persons that hold ordinary shares or series a preferred shares that are a hedge or that are hedged against interest rate or insurance risks or that are part of a straddle or conversion transaction  or persons whose functional currency is not the us dollar 
this summary assumes that an investor will hold our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares as capital assets  which generally means as property held for investment 
investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences  in their particular circumstances  of the ownership of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares under us federal  state  local and other tax laws 
for us federal income tax purposes and for purposes of the following discussion  a us person means i a citizen or resident of the united states  ii a corporation  or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes  or a partnership  or other entity treated as a partnership for u 
s federal income tax purposes  in each case created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any of its political subdivisions  iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income tax without regard to its source or iv a trust if either a a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or b the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us person for us federal income tax purposes 
a us person is a nonresident alien individual  or a corporation  estate or trust that is not a us person 
if a partnership owns ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership 
if you are a partner of a partnership that owns ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  you should consult your tax advisor 
united states taxation of endurance holdings and its operating subsidiaries we intend to operate endurance holdings and its non us subsidiaries in such a manner that they will not be considered to be conducting business within the united states for purposes of us federal income taxation 
whether business is being conducted in the united states is an inherently factual determination 
because the code  regulations and court decisions fail to identify definitively activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the united states  there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend successfully that endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk are or will be engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
a foreign corporation deemed to be so engaged would be subject to us federal income tax at a current maximum rate of  as well as a branch profits tax in certain circumstances  on its income which is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business unless the corporation is entitled to relief under the permanent establishment provision of an applicable tax treaty  as discussed below 
such income tax  if imposed  would be based on effectively connected income computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a us corporation  except that a foreign corporation is entitled to deductions and credits only if it timely files a us federal income tax return 
endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and endurance uk intend to file protective us federal income tax returns on a timely basis in order to preserve the right to claim income tax deductions and credits if it is ever determined that they are subject to us federal income tax 
if endurance bermuda is entitled to the benefits under the bermuda treaty  it will not be subject to us federal income tax on any income found to be effectively connected with a us trade or business unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the united states 
whether business is being conducted in the united states through a permanent establishment is an inherently factual determination 
endurance bermuda intends to conduct its activities so as not to have a permanent establishment in the united states  although there can be no assurance that it will achieve this result 
an insurance enterprise resident in bermuda generally will be entitled to the benefits of the bermuda treaty if i more than of its shares are owned beneficially  directly or indirectly  by individual residents of the united states or bermuda or us citizens and ii its income is not used in substantial part  directly or indirectly  to make disproportionate distributions to  or to meet certain liabilities of  persons who are neither residents of either the united states or bermuda nor us citizens 
foreign insurance companies that conduct an insurance business within the united states must maintain a certain minimum amount of effectively connected net investment income  determined in accordance with a formula that depends  in part  on the amount of us risk insured or reinsured by such companies 
if endurance bermuda is considered to be engaged in the conduct of an insurance business in the united states and it is not entitled to the benefits of the bermuda treaty  either because it fails to satisfy one of the limitations on bermuda treaty benefits described above or because endurance bermuda is considered to have a us permanent establishment  a significant portion of endurance bermuda s premium and investment income could be subject to us federal income tax 
in addition  while the bermuda treaty clearly applies to premium income  it is not clear whether it applies to other income  such as investment income 
consequently  if endurance bermuda is considered to be engaged in the conduct of an insurance business in the united states and is entitled to the benefits of the bermuda treaty  but the bermuda treaty is interpreted so as not to apply to investment income  a significant portion of endurance bermuda s investment income could be subject to us federal income tax even if endurance bermuda does not maintain a permanent establishment in the united states 
under the uk treaty  endurance uk  if entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty  will not be subject to uk federal income tax on any income found to be effectively connected with a us trade or business unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the united states 
endurance uk intends to conduct its activities in a manner so that it does not have a permanent establishment in the united states  although we cannot predict whether we will achieve this result 
endurance uk will be entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty if i during at least half of the days in the relevant taxable period  at least of endurance uk s stock is beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by citizens or residents of the united states and the united kingdom  and less than of endurance uk s gross income for the relevant taxable period is paid or accrued  directly or indirectly  to persons who are not us or us residents in the form of payments that are deductible for purposes of uk taxation or ii with respect to specific items of income  profit or gain derived from the united states  if such income  profit or gain is considered to be derived in connection with  or incidental to  endurance uk s business conducted in the united kingdom 
foreign corporations not engaged in a trade or business in the united states are nonetheless subject to us withholding tax at a rate of of the gross amount of certain fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains  profits and income derived from sources within the united states such as dividends and certain interest on investments  subject to reduction by applicable treaties 
the united states also imposes an excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers or reinsurers with respect to risks located in the united states 
the rate of tax applicable to premiums paid to endurance bermuda is for casualty insurance premiums and for reinsurance premiums 
the excise tax will not apply to premiums paid to endurance uk if endurance uk is entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty  and certain other requirements are met 
endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty and american merchants are delaware corporations and armtech is a texas corporation 
each will be subject to taxation in the united states at regular corporate rates 
dividends paid by endurance us holdings corp 
to endurance bermuda will be subject to us withholding tax at the rate of 
united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons dividends 
distributions with respect to ordinary shares and series a preferred shares including the payment of additional amounts  in the case of the series a preferred shares will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent of endurance holdings current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes  subject to the discussion below relating to the potential application of the controlled foreign corporation  related person insurance income and passive foreign investment company rules 
these dividends should constitute qualified dividend income as defined in section h b of the code and  thus  should be entitled to the preferential federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received before january  by certain shareholders such as individuals  provided that certain holding period requirements are satisfied and certain other conditions are met  and provided further that we are not considered a pfic 
distributions with respect to endurance holdings ordinary shares and series a preferred shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to us corporations under the code 
the amount of any distribution in excess of the current and accumulated earnings and profits of endurance holdings will first be applied to reduce a holder s tax basis in the ordinary shares or series a preferred shares as the case may be  and any amount in excess of tax basis will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such holder s shares 
classification of endurance holdings  endurance uk or endurance bermuda as a controlled foreign corporation 
each us shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during a taxable year  and who owns shares in the cfc directly or indirectly through foreign entities  in such corporation on the last day  in such year  in which such corporation is a cfc must include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
a foreign corporation is considered a cfc if us shareholders own directly  indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of such foreign corporation  or the total value of all stock of such corporation 
a us shareholder is a us person who owns at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the foreign corporation 
the series a preferred shares should not be considered voting stock for purposes of determining whether a us person would be a us shareholder unless and until there exists a nonpayment event which triggers the series a preferred shareholders right to elect two additional directors to the board of directors of endurance holdings 
in such case  the series a preferred shares should be treated as voting stock for as long as such right continues 
for purposes of taking into account insurance income  a cfc also includes a foreign corporation in which more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or more than of the total value of the stock is owned directly  indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules by us shareholders  on any day during the taxable year of such corporation  if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance contracts exceeds of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks 
due to the anticipated dispersion of endurance holdings share ownership among holders  its bye law provisions that impose limitations on the concentration of voting power of any shares that are entitled to vote and authorize the board to repurchase such shares under certain circumstances and other factors  no us person that owns shares in endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities should be subject to treatment as a us shareholder of a cfc 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will not challenge the effectiveness of these provisions for purposes of preventing us shareholder status and that a court will not sustain such challenge 
rpii companies 
the cfc rules also apply to certain insurance companies that earn related person insurance income 
for purposes of applying the cfc rules to foreign corporations that earn rpii  a different definition of controlled foreign corporation  as discussed below  applies 
rpii is defined as any insurance income attributable to policies of insurance or reinsurance with respect to which the person directly or indirectly insured is a rpii shareholder of the foreign corporation or a related person to such rpii shareholder 
in general  and subject to certain limitations  insurance income is income including premium and investment income attributable to the issuing of any insurance or reinsurance contract which would be taxed under the portions of the code relating to insurance companies if the income were the income of a domestic insurance company 
for purposes of the rpii rules  related person means someone who controls or is controlled by the rpii shareholder or someone who is controlled by the same person or persons which control the rpii shareholder 
control is measured by either more than in value or more than in voting power of stock  applying constructive ownership principles 
a corporation s pension plan is ordinarily not a related person with respect to the corporation unless the pension plan owns  directly or indirectly through the application of constructive ownership rules  more than  measured by vote or value  of the stock of the corporation 
for purposes of inclusion of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s rpii in the income of a rpii shareholder  to the extent required under the rpii rules  the term rpii shareholder means any us person who owns  directly or indirectly through foreign entities  any amount rather than stock possessing or more of the total combined voting power of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s stock 
endurance uk or endurance bermuda will be treated as a cfc for rpii purposes if such persons collectively own directly  indirectly through foreign entities or by application of the constructive ownership rules or more of the stock of endurance uk or endurance bermuda by vote or value 
rpii exceptions 
the special rpii rules do not apply if i direct or indirect insureds and persons related to such insureds  whether or not us persons  own  directly or indirectly  less than of the voting power and less than of the value of the stock of endurance uk or endurance bermuda  as applicable the ownership exception  ii rpii  determined on a gross basis  is less than of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s gross insurance income for the taxable year  as applicable the gross income exception  iii endurance uk or endurance bermuda elects to be taxed on its rpii as if the rpii were effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business and to waive all treaty benefits with respect to rpii and meets certain other requirements or iv endurance uk or endurance bermuda elects to be treated as a us corporation 
endurance bermuda and endurance uk intend to operate in a manner that is intended to ensure that each qualifies for the gross income exception 
it is possible that neither endurance bermuda nor endurance uk will be successful in qualifying under this exception 
if none of these exceptions applies  each us person who owns shares in endurance holdings and therefore  indirectly in endurance uk and endurance bermuda on the last day of endurance holdings taxable year  will be required to include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its share of rpii of endurance uk and or endurance bermuda for the entire taxable year 
this inclusion will be determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately only to such us persons holding shares in endurance holdings at that date 
the inclusion will be limited to the current year earnings and profits of endurance uk or endurance bermuda  as applicable  reduced by the shareholder s pro rata share  if any  of certain prior year deficits in earnings and profits 
basis adjustments 
a rpii shareholder s tax basis in its endurance holdings ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  as the case may be  will be increased by the amount of any rpii that the shareholder includes in income 
any distributions made by endurance holdings out of previously taxed rpii income will be exempt from further tax in the hands of the rpii shareholder 
the rpii shareholder s tax basis in its endurance holdings shares will be reduced by the amount of any distributions that are excluded from income under this rule 
information reporting 
under certain circumstances  us persons owning stock in a foreign corporation are required to file irs form with their us federal income tax returns 
generally  information reporting on irs form is required with respect to i a person who is treated as a rpii shareholder  ii a us shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during any tax year of the foreign corporation  and who owned the stock on the last of that year and iii under certain circumstances  a us person who acquires stock in a foreign corporation  and as a result thereof owns or more of the voting power or value of such foreign corporation  whether or not such foreign corporation is a cfc 
for any taxable year in which endurance holdings determines that gross rpii constitutes or more of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s gross insurance income and the ownership exception does not apply  endurance holdings intends to mail to all us persons registered as holders of its ordinary shares and series a preferred shares irs form  completed with information from endurance holdings  for attachment to the us federal income tax returns of such shareholders 
a tax exempt organization that is treated as a us shareholder or a rpii shareholder also must file irs form in the circumstances described above 
failure to file irs form may result in penalties 
tax exempt shareholders 
tax exempt entities will be required to treat certain subpart f insurance income  including rpii  that is includible in income by the tax exempt entity as unrelated business taxable income 
dispositions of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
subject to the discussion below relating to the redemption of series a preferred shares or the potential application of code section or the pfic rules  any gain or loss realized by a us person on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or series a preferred shares will be subject to us federal income taxation as capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized upon such sale or exchange and such person s tax basis in the shares 
if the holding period for these shares exceeds one year at the time of the disposition  any gain will be subject to tax at a current maximum marginal tax rate of for individuals and for corporations 
moreover  gain  if any  generally will be us source gain and generally will constitute passive income for foreign tax credit limitation purposes 
code section provides that if a us person sells or exchanges stock in a foreign corporation and such person owned directly  indirectly through certain foreign entities or constructively or more of the voting power of the corporation at any time during the five year period ending on the date of disposition when the corporation was a cfc  any gain from the sale or exchange of the shares will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the cfc s earnings and profits determined under us federal income tax principles during the period that the shareholder held the shares and while the corporation was a cfc with certain adjustments 
a us shareholder may in certain circumstances be required to report a disposition of shares of a cfc by attaching irs form to the us federal income tax or information return that it would normally file for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs 
for these purposes  the series a preferred shares should not be considered as having voting power unless and until there exists a nonpayment event which triggers the series a preferred shareholders right to elect two additional directors to the board of directors of endurance holdings 
in such case  the series a preferred shares should be treated as voting stock for as long as such right continues 
section also applies to the sale or exchange of shares in a foreign corporation if the foreign corporation would be treated as a cfc for rpii purposes and would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation  regardless of whether the shareholder is a us shareholder or whether the gross income exception or the ownership exception applies 
regulations do not specifically address whether or how code section would apply to dispositions of shares of stock in a foreign corporation that is not a cfc and does not directly engage in the insurance business  but has a subsidiary that is a cfc and that would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation 
the company believes  however  that the application of code section under the rpii rules should not apply to the disposition of ordinary shares or series a preferred shares because endurance holdings is not directly engaged in the insurance business 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will not interpret the regulations in a contrary manner or that the us treasury department will not amend the regulations to provide that these rules will apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the effects of these rules on a disposition of our shares 
uncertainty as to application of rpii 
regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form 
it is not certain whether these regulations will be adopted in their proposed form or what changes might ultimately be made or whether any such changes  as well as any interpretation or application of the rpii rules by the irs  the courts or otherwise  might have retroactive effect 
accordingly  the meaning of the rpii provisions and their application to endurance uk and endurance bermuda is uncertain 
these provisions include the grant of authority to the us treasury to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection  including regulations preventing the avoidance of this subsection through cross insurance arrangements or otherwise 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge any determinations by endurance uk or endurance bermuda as to the amount  if any  of rpii that should be includible in income or that the amounts of the rpii inclusions will not be subject to adjustment based upon subsequent irs examination 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the effects of these uncertainties 
redemption of series a preferred shares 
subject to the discussion herein relating to the application of the rpii and pfic rules  under section of the code  a redemption of the series a preferred shares will be treated as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  unless such redemption satisfies the tests set forth under section b of the code  which would treat the redemption as a sale or exchange subject to taxation as described above under dispositions of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
a redemption will be treated as a sale or exchange if i it is substantially disproportionate  ii constitutes a complete termination of the holder s stock interest in us  or iii is not essentially equivalent to a dividend  each within the meaning of section b of the code 
in determining whether any of these tests are satisfied  shares considered to be owned by a us person by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the code  as well as shares actually owned  must generally be taken into account 
because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of section b of the code is satisfied with respect to a particular holder of the series a preferred shares will depend on the facts and circumstances as of the time the determination is made  us shareholders should consult their tax advisors  at such time  to determine their tax treatment in light of their particular circumstances 
passive foreign investment companies 
in general  a foreign corporation will be a pfic during a given year if i or more of its gross income constitutes passive income or ii or more of its assets produce passive income 
if endurance holdings were characterized as a pfic during a given year  us persons owning ordinary shares or series a preferred shares would be subject to a penalty tax at the time of the sale at a gain of  or receipt of an excess distribution with respect to  their shares  unless such shareholders made a qualified electing fund election or mark to market election 
it is uncertain that endurance holdings would be able to provide its shareholders with the information necessary for a us person to make the elections 
in general  a shareholder receives an excess distribution if the amount of the distribution is more than of the average distribution with respect to the shares during the three preceding taxable years or shorter period during which the taxpayer held the shares 
in general  the penalty tax is equivalent to an interest charge on taxes that are deemed due during the period the shareholder owned the shares  computed by assuming that the excess distribution or gain in the case of a sale with respect to the shares was taxed in equal portions at the highest applicable tax rate on ordinary income throughout the shareholder s period of ownership 
the interest charge is equal to the applicable rate imposed on underpayments of us federal income tax for such period 
for the above purposes  passive income generally includes interest  dividends  annuities and other investment income 
the pfic statutory provisions  however  contain an express exception for income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a corporation which is predominantly engaged in an insurance business 
this exception is intended to ensure that income derived by a bona fide insurance company is not treated as passive income  except to the extent such income is attributable to financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of the insurance business 
endurance holdings expects for purposes of the pfic rules that each of endurance uk and endurance bermuda will be predominantly engaged in an insurance business and is unlikely to have financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of its insurance business 
accordingly  neither expects to be treated as a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
there can be no assurances  however  that this will be the case 
the pfic statutory provisions contain a look through rule stating that  for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is a pfic  such foreign corporation shall be treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of the income 


and as if it held its proportionate share of the assets 


of any other corporation in which it owns at least by value of the shares 
while no explicit guidance is provided by the statutory language  under this look through rule endurance holdings should be deemed to own the assets and to have received the income of its insurance subsidiaries directly for purposes of determining whether it qualifies for the insurance exception 
consequently  endurance holdings does not expect to be treated as a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
this interpretation of the look through rule is consistent with the legislative intention generally to exclude bona fide insurance companies from the application of pfic provision 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such challenge 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisor as to the effects of the pfic rules 
other 
except as discussed below with respect to backup withholding  dividends paid by endurance holdings will not be subject to us withholding tax 
information reporting and backup withholding 
information returns may be filed with the irs in connection with payments of dividends with respect to our ordinary shares or series a preferred shares and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the shares unless the shareholder establishes an exemption from the information reporting rules 
a us person holding our ordinary shares or series a preferred shares that does not establish such an exemption may be subject to us backup withholding tax on these payments if the holder fails to provide its taxpayer identification number or otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules 
the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a us person will be allowed as a credit against the us person s us federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund  provided that the required information is furnished to the irs 
shareholders who are non us persons dividends and disposition 
in general and subject to the discussion below under information reporting and backup withholding  a non us person will not be subject to us federal income or withholding tax with respect to payments of dividends on  or gain upon the disposition of  our ordinary shares or series a preferred shares unless i the dividends or gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the non us person of a trade or business in the united states or ii in the case of gain upon the disposition of shares  the non us person is an individual who is present in the united states for days or more in the taxable year and certain other conditions are met 
nonresident alien individuals will not be subject to us estate tax with respect to our ordinary shares or series a preferred shares 
dividends or gain that is effectively connected with the conduct by a non us person of a trade or business in the united states generally will be subject to regular us federal income tax in the same manner as if it were realized by a us person 
in addition  if such non us 
person is a non us 
corporation  such dividends or gain may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of or such lower rate as is provided by an applicable income tax treaty 
information reporting and backup withholding 
if our ordinary shares or series a preferred shares are held by a non us person through a non us and non us related broker or financial institution  information reporting and backup withholding generally would not be required 
information reporting  and possibly backup withholding  may apply if the shares are held by a non us person through a non us or us related broker or financial institution and the us person fails to provide appropriate information 
non us persons should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules

among the factors considered by the board of directors in determining the amount of each dividend are the results of operations and the capital requirements  growth and other characteristics of our businesses 
the declaration and payment of future dividends is also subject to certain legal  regulatory and other restrictions 
endurance holdings is a holding company and has no direct operations 
the ability of endurance holdings to pay dividends or distributions depends almost exclusively on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to endurance holdings 
under bermuda law  endurance bermuda may not declare or pay a dividend if there are reasonable grounds for believing that endurance bermuda is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or the realizable value of endurance bermuda s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
further  endurance bermuda  as a regulated insurance company in bermuda  is subject to additional regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions 
as of december   the maximum amount of distributions that endurance bermuda could pay to endurance holdings under applicable insurance and companies act regulations without prior regulatory approval was approximately million 
during  endurance uk was precluded by regulatory restrictions from declaring or distributing dividends 
endurance uk is currently completing statutory income loss statements for the year ended december  the company does not expect endurance uk to have material dividend capacity in as of december   endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  and endurance american specialty did not have earned surplus and thus were precluded from dividend distributions in without prior regulatory approval 
as of december   american merchants and armtech with notice to the texas department of insurance could pay million and million of dividends  respectively  without prior regulatory approval 
our credit facilities prohibit endurance holdings from declaring or paying any dividends if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such declaration or payment or would result from such declaration or payment 
in addition  the terms of our series a preferred shares prohibit dividends from being declared or paid on ordinary shares unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on all outstanding series a preferred shares have been declared and paid
