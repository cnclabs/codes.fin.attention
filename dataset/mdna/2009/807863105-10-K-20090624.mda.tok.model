we do not undertake to update any forward looking statements that may be made by or on behalf of us  in this annual report or otherwise 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  the risk factors set forth below 
our business depends upon the growth of the student population and school expenditures and can be adversely impacted by fixed school budgets 
our growth strategy and profitability depend in part on growth in the student population and expenditures per student in prek schools 
the level of student enrollment is largely a function of demographics  while expenditures per student are affected by federal  state and local government budgets 
for example  from to  the industry was negatively affected by a generally weakened economic environment which placed pressure on some state and local budgets  the primary sources of school funding 
this was evidenced  among other things  by the decline in state tax revenue in in school districts in states that primarily rely on local tax proceeds for funding  significant reductions in those proceeds for any reason can restrict district expenditures and impact our results of operations 
any significant and sustained decline in student enrollment and or expenditures per student could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
because school budgets are fixed on a yearly basis  any shift by schools in expenditures during a given fiscal year to areas that are not part of our business  such as facility operating costs and employee related expenditures  could also materially affect our business 
the negative global macroeconomic conditions could impact the education funding provided by state and local governments 
the weakened economic environment may place increased pressure on state and local government budgets  which are the primary source of school funding 
the global economy is currently suffering a severe recession which has lead to a decline in consumer and business spending and confidence 
this has resulted in our customers delaying or cutting school expenditures as the recession creates state and local budget deficits and uncertainty 
if the global economic downturn worsens or continues for a significant period of time  it could result in a significant and sustained decline in the per student funding levels provided for in state and local budgets which could have a materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased costs and other difficulties associated with the distribution of our products would adversely affect our results of operations 
higher than expected costs and other difficulties associated with the distribution of our products could affect our results of operations 
to the extent we incur difficulties or higher than expected costs related to updating our distribution centers  such costs may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any disruption in our ability to service our customers may also impact our revenues or profits 
moreover  as we update our distribution model or change the product mix of our distribution centers  we may encounter unforeseen costs or difficulties that may have an adverse impact on our financial performance 
our business is highly seasonal 
because most of our customers want their school supplies delivered before or shortly after the commencement of the school year  we record most of our revenues from june to october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of orders for our products so that schools and teachers receive their products by the start of each school year 
to the extent we do not sell our products to schools during the peak shipping season  many of such sales opportunities will be lost and will not be available in subsequent quarters 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
this seasonality causes our operating results and operating cash flows to vary considerably from quarter to quarter within our fiscal years 
if our key suppliers or service providers were unable to provide the products and services we require  our business could be adversely affected 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for some of our products  especially furniture and proprietary products 
we also depend upon a limited number of service providers for the delivery of our products 
if these suppliers or service providers are unable to provide the products or services that we require or materially increase their costs especially during our peak season of june through october  our ability to deliver our products on a timely and profitable basis could be impaired and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our agreements with our suppliers are terminable at any time or on short notice  with or without cause  and  while we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be good  we cannot assure that any or all of our relationships will not be terminated or that such relationships will continue as presently in effect 
our business is highly competitive 
the market for supplemental educational products and equipment is highly competitive and fragmented 
we estimate that over  companies market supplemental educational products and equipment to schools with prek as a primary focus of their business 
we also face competition from alternate channel marketers  including office supply superstores  office product contract stationers  and purchasing cooperatives that have not traditionally focused on marketing supplemental educational products and equipment 
our competitors impact the prices we are able to charge and we expect to continue to face pricing pressure from our competitors in the future 
these competitors are likely to continue to expand their product lines and interest in supplemental educational products and equipment 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources and buying power than we do 
we believe that the supplemental educational products and equipment market will consolidate over the next several years  which could increase competition in both our markets and our search for attractive acquisition candidates 
we also face increased competition and pricing pressure as a result of the accessibility of the internet 
if any of our key personnel discontinue their role with us  our business could be adversely affected 
our business depends to a large extent on the abilities and continued efforts of current executive officers and senior management 
we are also likely to depend heavily on the executive officers and senior management of businesses that we acquire in the future 
if any of these people becomes unable or unwilling to continue in his or her role  or if we are unable to attract and retain other key personnel and qualified employees  our business could be adversely affected 
we have employment contracts with many of our key officers 
other than the life insurance we have in place for our chief executive officer  we do not have and do not intend to obtain key man life insurance covering any of our executive officers or other members of our management 
a failure to successfully implement our business strategy could materially and adversely affect our operations and growth opportunities 
our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and we may not be successful in implementing our strategy 
in addition  the implementation of our strategy may not lead to improved operating results 
we may decide to alter or discontinue aspects of our business strategy and may adopt alternative or additional strategies due to business or competitive factors or factors not currently expected  such as unforeseen costs and expenses or events beyond our control 
any failure to successfully implement our business strategy could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and growth opportunities 
we face risks associated with our increasing emphasis on imported goods and private label products 
increases in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported goods may adversely impact our revenues and profits and have an adverse impact on our cash flows 
our business strategy includes an increased emphasis on offering private label products and sourcing quality merchandise directly from low cost suppliers 
as a result  we expect to rely more heavily on imported goods from china and other countries and we expect the sale of imported goods to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues 
to the extent we rely more heavily on the sale of private label products  our potential exposure to product liability claims may increase 
in addition  our reputation may become more closely tied to our private label products and may suffer to the extent our customers are not satisfied with the quality of such products 
private label products will also increase our risks associated with returns and inventory obsolescence 
our reliance on imported merchandise subjects us to a number of risks  including a increased difficulties in ensuring quality control  b disruptions in the flow of imported goods due to factors such as raw material shortages  work stoppages  strikes  and political unrest in foreign countries  c problems with oceanic shipping  including shipping container shortages  d economic crises and international disputes  e increases in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise resulting from a failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china and the other countries we do business in  f import duties  import quotas  and other trade sanctions  and g increases in shipping rates imposed by the trans pacific shipping cartel 
if imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable  we may not be able to transition to alternative sources in time to meet our demands 
a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods due to these or other factors would significantly decrease our revenues and profits and have an adverse impact on our cash flows 
currency exchange rates may impact our financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
to the extent we source merchandise from overseas manufacturers and sell products internationally  exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to service our us dollar denominated debt 
the majority of our debt will be in us dollars while a portion of our revenue is derived from imported products and international sales 
therefore  fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies versus the us dollar could impact our costs and revenues 
in addition  for the purposes of financial reporting  any change in the value of the foreign currencies against the us dollar during a given financial reporting period would result in a foreign currency loss or gain 
consequently  our reported earnings could fluctuate as a result of foreign exchange translation and may not be comparable from period to period 
it is difficult to forecast our revenue stream given the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers and delays in passage of state budgets 
the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers  the fact that our customers typically purchase products on an as needed basis  and the lack of visibility to education funding levels if state budgets are delayed make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenue stream  which may vary significantly from period to period 
financial analysts and others that may seek to project our future performance face similar difficulties 
the difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue increases the likelihood that our financial results will differ materially from any projected financial results 
any shortfall in our financial results from our  or third party  projected results could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock and our convertible subordinated notes 
if we are unable to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
a significant amount of our past growth has come from acquisitions 
future growth in our revenues and earnings will be impacted by our ability to continue to acquire and successfully integrate businesses 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify and acquire businesses on reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to do so  our future growth may be limited  or our revenues could decline 
in addition  the integration of acquired businesses with our existing business operations presents many challenges and can demand significant attention from our key managers 
the demands placed upon the time of our management team may adversely affect the operation of our existing business 
managing and integrating acquired businesses may result in substantial costs  delays  or other operating or financial problems that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
key risks in making acquisitions involve failure to execute as well or as quickly as anticipated on our integration plans  including the integration of acquired employees  operations  technologies and products with our existing business and products  retention of business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business  loss of key personnel of the acquired business  the diversion of our management during the integration process  and resistance to cultural changes in the acquired organization 
we have a material amount of goodwill  other intangible assets and capitalized product development costs which might be written down 
at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
goodwill is the amount by which the costs of an acquisition exceed the fair value of the net assets we acquire 
in addition  we are required to evaluate whether our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired 
reductions in our net income caused by the write down of our existing goodwill or intangible assets or any goodwill or intangible assets acquired in any future acquisition we may make could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  during fiscal we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million related to goodwill and other intangibles assets of our discontinued school specialty media ssm business unit 
in addition  we had capitalized product development costs of million and million at april  and april   respectively  related to both internally developed and acquired proprietary products  which are amortized to expense over the lesser of five years or the product s life cycle 
any changes in the estimated sales volume or life cycle of the underlying products could cause the currently capitalized costs or costs capitalized in the future to be impaired 
for example  during fiscal we recorded pre tax impairments charges of million related to product development costs of ssm 
volatility in our stock price as a result of the negative macroeconomic conditions could result in a potential goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charge 
goodwill impairment analysis and measurement require significant management judgment 
the company s stock price and an estimated control premium are two factors that can significantly impact the fair value assessment of the company s reporting units 
the significant decline in the general global economic conditions has led to volatility in the company s stock price during fiscal during this period  our stock price fluctuated between a high of per share and a low of per share 
if the current worldwide economic downturn continues  it could result in circumstances  such as a sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization or a decrease in our forecasted cash flows that potentially indicate that the carrying value of our long lived assets or goodwill may be impaired 
if we are required to record a significant non cash charge to our earnings because of an impairment of our long lived assets or goodwill  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
our operations are dependent on our information systems 
we have integrated the operations of most of our divisions and subsidiaries  which operate on systems located at both our greenville  wisconsin  headquarters and our third party hosted erp system provider s facilities 
in addition  there are divisions running legacy systems hosted at their locations 
all systems rely on continuous telecommunication connections to the main computers 
if any of these connections becomes disrupted  or unavailable  for an extended period of time  the disruption could materially and adversely affect our business  operations and financial performance 
we also continue to introduce new information systems to achieve a common processing infrastructure for all of our businesses  particularly the new erp platform described elsewhere in this report  which will displace existing legacy systems 
as we implement the new systems  there is the possibility that it can be disruptive should the new systems not perform as expected 
even though we have taken precautions to protect ourselves from unexpected events that could interrupt new  existing and acquired business operations and systems  we cannot be sure that fire  flood or other natural disasters would not disable our systems and or prevent them from communicating between business segments 
the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also face challenges in integrating the information systems of any companies we acquire 
the costs associated with performing such integrations or any disruptions resulting from a failure to successfully make any such integration could materially impact our business 
we rely on our intellectual property in the design and marketing of our products 
we rely on certain trademarks  trade names and service names  along with licenses to use and exploit certain trademarks  trade names and service names collectively  the marks in the design and marketing of some of our products 
we could lose our ability to use our brands if our marks were found to be generic or non descriptive 
while no single mark is material to our business  the termination of a number of these marks could have an adverse effect on our business 
we also rely on certain copyrights  patents and licenses other than those described above  the termination of which could have an adverse effect on our business 
the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business  could prohibit us from engaging in transactions we believe to be beneficial and could lead to the acceleration of our debt 
our existing and future debt agreements impose and will impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities 
these restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios  and restrict our ability and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt  create liens  make acquisitions  redeem and or prepay certain debt  sell or dispose of a minority equity interest in any subsidiary or other assets  make capital expenditures  make certain investments  enter new lines of business  engage in consolidations  mergers and acquisitions  repurchase or redeem capital stock  guarantee obligations  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  and pay dividends and make other distributions 
our amended and restated senior credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial ratios  including a total leverage ratio  a senior leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by  among other things  limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  mergers and acquisitions  and other corporate opportunities 
upon the failure to comply with the financial ratios contained in our amended and restated credit facility  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we may not have sufficient assets to repay our amended and restated credit facility 
also  should there be an event of default  or need to obtain waivers following an event of default  we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and or more restrictive covenants in future periods

item legal proceedings during fiscal  the company was informed that one of its subsidiaries had been contacted by the united states environmental protection agency epa seeking consensual resolution of potential compliance claims  including monetary sanctions  regarding the alleged unauthorized distribution during fiscal of certain product offerings containing an anti microbial agent

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report 
background we are a leading education company serving the prek education market by providing products  programs and services that enhance student achievement and development to educators and schools across the united states and canada 
we offer more than  items through an innovative two pronged marketing approach that targets both school administrators and individual teachers 
our goal is to grow profitably as a leading provider of supplemental education products 
we expect to achieve this goal over the long term through both organic growth and through selective acquisitions 
historically  we have grown through a combination of acquisitions and internal investments that drive organic growth 
in the past few years  our growth strategies have been focused primarily on the curriculum based supplemental products  and we expect that this focus will continue in the foreseeable future 
while the number of acquisitions that we have completed has declined in the past two years  acquisitions remain a key strategy for us 
our future acquisition plans are focused primarily on acquiring curriculum based products in disciplines where the company s current product offerings do not have the desired breadth and depth 
in addition  the company is committed to continuing to invest in its internal product development efforts in order to expand current offerings such as its science and reading intervention curricula 
these growth plans  both through acquisitions and internal product development  will be mainly focused on curriculum based products because these types of products provide a competitive advantage in their proprietary nature  and have typically provided greater profit margins to the company 
the company s annual revenue growth from curriculum based products has been and will continue to be impacted by the cyclical nature of state adoptions of these products 
our state adoption revenue will continue to have significant variability between years due to the adoption schedules established by the individual states 
as such  we expect fiscal adoption revenue to decline compared to fiscal adoption revenue  which in turn had declined from fiscal the company also remains committed to its commodity type products and while its acquisition strategy is more focused on curriculum based supplemental products  the company continues to invest resources towards increasing the company s market share for these commodity based products 
while our gross margin has remained constant at when comparing fiscal to fiscal  the gross margin in fiscal was negatively affected by a combination of increased costs from vendors and higher fuel costs on inbound freight  which due to the timing of these increases  were not able to be passed on to our customers due to fixed pricing and longer lived catalogs 
from fiscal through fiscal  we were able to expand our gross margins by basis points 
this expansion is primarily due to our acquisition of publishing businesses  which tend to have more proprietary products in their offerings and consequently higher gross margins than our educational resources businesses 
the publishing businesses have traditionally experienced higher revenue growth than the educational resources segment  resulting in a product mix with higher gross margins 
in addition  our growth has increased our purchasing power  resulting in reduced costs of the products we purchase 
further  through the vertical acquisitions of school specialty publishing and califone  we have acquired suppliers and have thereby captured the suppliers margins 
another factor contributing to the flat gross margin is the direct sourcing of product through overseas channels 
also the year to year variation in state adoption revenue  which is typically higher gross margin product  will have an impact on gross margin between years 
in fiscal  our operating income and margin from continuing operations were million and  respectively 
in fiscal  our operating income and margin from continuing operations were million and  respectively 
the company s business results have been negatively impacted by the recent downturn in the economy 
the current economic conditions resulted in revenue and profitability declines as cautious spending by schools and teachers and growing state budget deficits have created uncertainty as to upcoming education funding levels from the states 
while we believe the economic stimulus package which president obama signed in february  will preserve educational funding as the states finalize budgets for the upcoming year  school districts and educators are taking a wait and see approach until the state budgets for the upcoming year are finalized 
in response to this uncertainty as to education funding  a possible period of reduced spending by schools and the uncertainty of the duration of any such reduction  all of which could negatively impact our revenues  the company has initiated a significant expense reduction plan in order to better balance expenses and product costs with potentially lower revenue 
this expense reduction plan is intended to be accomplished through a combination of facility closures  functional department consolidations that resulted in staff reductions and improvements in our control of product costs through negotiations with some of the company s larger vendors 
we anticipate these cost savings will offset the margin decline attributable to an expected revenue shortfall caused by the weakened economy 
our business and working capital needs are highly seasonal with peak sales levels occurring from june through october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of our business so that schools and teachers receive their products by the start of each school year 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between june and october and the majority of cash receipts are collected from september through december 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
our business is highly seasonal  and the acquisition of seasonal businesses during the off season has depressed operating and net income in the year of acquisition  the most dramatic of which in recent years was the delta education acquisition in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed the acquisition of sitton spelling sitton from egger publishing  inc for an all cash  aggregate purchase price of million 
sitton offers spelling and word skills programs to help educators in the area of reading intervention 
sitton also has professional development programs for educators through nationwide seminars conducted by independent trainers 
this business has been integrated into the company s educator s publishing service business within the publishing segment 
the results of sitton have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements under item since the date of acquisition and would not have had a material effect on the company s overall performance on a pro forma basis and did not have a material effect on the company s fiscal performance 
the company announced in fiscal its intention to sell the hawthorne  new york based school specialty media ssm business unit 
the sale  which was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  reflects the company s desire to focus investments and management s attention on those businesses that advance the company s long term growth strategies 
those long term growth strategies include strengthening the company s presence in those categories that require higher educational content products and services  such as science curriculum and reading intervention solutions 
at the same time  the company remains committed to its commodity type products and markets and will continue to invest in those products and markets 
however  management believes that the future growth of the company is more dependent on those products with higher educational content 
in pursuit of our long term growth strategy the company is in the process of investing company resources  both financial capital and human capital  in product development programs focused on those educational content areas as well as acquisition targets that already have or are in the process of developing educational content products 
the company has reflected ssm as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations under item and throughout this md a

overview of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its operating segments in order to align its segments with changes in the management and reporting structure of the company 
revenues from continuing operations for fiscal decreased to billion as compared to billion in fiscal this decrease was related primarily to a decrease in state adoption revenue derived from the company s science curriculum based offering 
we anticipate that state adoption revenue will continue to have significant variability between years due to the adoption schedules established by individual states 
as a result of these schedules  we expect fiscal adoption revenue will decline as compared to fiscal adoption revenue 
also contributing to the decreased revenue was the economic slowdown and a delay in spending by school districts due to uncertainty as to the education funding levels because of state budgetary concerns 
the company s overall revenue mix shifted toward the educational resources segment  with the segment comprising of revenues in fiscal as compared with in fiscal gross margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was attributable to a combination of both the revenue mix shift towards educational resources  which typically has lower gross margins than publishing segment  and decreased gross margins in both segments 
the primary cause of the decreased gross margin in the educational resources segment is related to product mix shifting towards lower margin furniture products versus consumable products 
the remaining decline in gross margin is due to a combination of cost increases being passed on to the company from its vendors  and higher fuel costs increasing inbound freight costs associated with procuring the products 
operating income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in operating income and margins were primarily related to the declines in both consolidated revenue and gross margin 
reductions in selling  general and administrative costs partially offset the decline in operating income 
revenue revenues decreased from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal which was attributable to declines in both the educational resources and publishing group segments 
educational resources segment revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue amounts for both periods were comprised solely of sales to external parties 
the decrease in educational resources segment revenues was due primarily to a decline of approximately million in consumable products 
this was partially offset by an increase of approximately million in furniture and school building project revenue in fiscal the increase in furniture and school building project revenue was attributable mainly to school construction projects for which the schools and districts had committed funds prior to the economic downturn 
the decline in the consumable products revenue was most directly attributable to the deteriorating economic conditions  which we believe have negatively impacted state budgets 
we believe that these state budget shortfalls have created uncertainty with school districts and educators as to state funding levels for education  translating into the declines in consumable product revenue 
revenue from basic school supplies has been relatively stable in fiscal  but a shortfall in supplemental curriculum and student development supplies  which we believe are more discretionary and are purchased more at the educator level versus district level  accounted for a majority of the decline in consumable revenue within the segment 
publishing segment revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal which included million of intersegment revenues to million in fiscal which included million of intersegment revenues 
the decrease in publishing segment revenues was primarily attributable to a decline of approximately million of state adoption revenue from the company s curriculum based products 
publishing segment revenue increased by million in fiscal due to realizing a full twelve months of revenue from the sitton acquisition  which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal offsetting this million increase was a decline related to the downturn in the general economic conditions 
gross profit gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in consolidated revenue resulted in million of the decline in gross profit had consolidated gross margin remained constant 
the remaining decline of million was related to gross margin declines 
gross margin decreased basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal approximately basis points of the decline in gross margin was related to the mix of revenue between segments 
the publishing segment  which generates higher margin than the educational resources segment  accounted for of the consolidated revenue in fiscal as compared to of the consolidated revenue in fiscal the remaining decline in gross margin was related to gross margin declines in both segments  as further discussed below 
educational resources segment gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in segment revenue resulted in million of the decline in gross profit had segment gross margin remained constant 
the remaining decline of million was related to a decline of basis points in segment gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal approximately million of the decline  or basis points of the gross margin decline was a result of product mix shifting toward lower margin furniture products versus consumable products 
the remaining decline of approximately million  or basis points of gross margin  was related to increases both in product costs and inbound freight costs  primarily  during the higher volume summer months 
the company was not able to pass on these vendor and transportation cost increases to customers due to current fixed pricing within contract agreements and longer lived catalogs 
publishing segment gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in segment revenue resulted in million of the decline in the gross profit  had segment gross margin remained constant 
the remaining decline of million was related to a decline of basis points segment gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal a shift in the product mix within the segment  primarily related to the decline in the higher margin curriculum based products for state adoptions  resulted in approximately basis points of gross margin decline 
partially offsetting this year over year decline related to product mix was the impact on fiscal gross margin of a million inventory donation from this segment which decreased fiscal gross margin by basis points 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include selling expenses  the most significant of which are sales wages and commissions  operations expenses  which include customer service  warehouse and out bound freight costs  catalog costs  general administrative overhead  which includes information systems  accounting  legal and human resources  depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense 
sg a as a percent of revenues increased basis points from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal sg a decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in sg a costs was due primarily to reductions in variable costs associated with the revenue decline  reductions in variable performance based compensation expense  and other cost reduction efforts 
the increase in sg a as a percent of revenue was driven by the base of non variable costs in comparison to decreased revenue 
educational resources segment sg a remained flat as a percent of revenues at in both fiscal and fiscal educational resources segment sg a decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the segment incurred million of severance costs in fiscal related to headcount reductions and approximately million of additional costs for marketing initiatives 
these increases had been offset by approximately million of a decline due to a decline in variable costs such as transportation  warehousing  and selling expenses associated with decreased revenues  and approximately million related to a reduction in variable performance based compensation expense 
the remaining decline is related primarily to the compensation savings associated with the headcount reductions 
publishing segment sg a remained flat as a percent of revenue at in both fiscal and fiscal publishing segment sg a decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the segment incurred million of severance costs associated with headcount reductions 
these increases have been offset by approximately million of a decline in variable costs such as transportation  warehousing  and selling expenses mainly associated with decreased revenues  and a reduction of approximately million in variable performance based compensation expense 
the remaining decrease is primarily related to the savings associated with headcount reductions 
corporate sg a increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in corporate sg a was primarily related to million for the closing of the lyons  new york distribution center  and million of severance costs related to the company s cost reduction efforts 
corporate sg a decreased by approximately million in fiscal as a result of decreased variable performance based compensation expense 
partially offsetting this decline were various increases including approximately million of employee benefits  approximately million of incremental depreciation related to the erp phased implementation  approximately million of bank fees and sales tax audits  and approximately million of the direct marketing and product management initiatives 
net interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of the decrease in interest expense was due to a reduction in the overall effective borrowing rate to in fiscal as compared to an effective borrowing rate of in fiscal the reduction in the borrowing rate is attributable to the decreased rates in the overall credit markets 
the remaining decrease was related primarily to a reduction in average outstanding borrowings in fiscal  as cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by share repurchases made by the company during fiscal  have been used to reduce debt 
in may  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fasb staff position apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
fsp apb requires an issuer of certain convertible debt instruments to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
fsp apb will be effective for the company at the beginning of fiscal april  and requires retrospective application to all periods presented during which any such convertible debt instruments were outstanding 
the company expects fsp apb to have a negative impact on historical results of operations when applied retrospectively and future operating results as long as the company continues to have convertible debentures outstanding primarily as a result of the recognition of increased non cash interest expense 
the company adopted apb on its effective date 
the adoption will have a material impact on the reported values of debt and equity 
the adoption of apb will also reduce historical diluted earnings per share from through by approximately to per share 
the anticipated impact of apb will be a reduction of diluted earnings of approximately per share 
other expense other expense  which primarily consists of the discount and loss on the company s accounts receivable securitization  was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal approximately million of the decrease in the discount and loss was due to lower effective discount rates associated with the company s securitization facility in fiscal as compared to fiscal the securitization facility expired on january  and the company elected to not renew the agreement due to the expected future expense of the facility compared to other sources of liquidity available to the company 
this reduced the amount of discount and loss in other expense in fiscal by approximately million 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower pre tax income 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase between years is primarily related to the incremental tax benefit realized in fiscal for favorable tax treatment of certain inventory donations 
the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of in both years primarily due to foreign income tax that is taxed at higher rates than domestic tax  along with state taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal the following discussion and analysis of fiscal results compared to fiscal results is based on a comparison of the company s results of operations from continuing operations 
overview of fiscal revenues from continuing operations for fiscal increased to billion as compared to billion in fiscal this increase was related primarily to incremental state adoption revenue derived from our science curriculum offerings  partially offset by a year over year decline in our mass merchant retail business  and an organic revenue increase generated by our educational resources business unit 
the company s overall revenue mix shifted toward the publishing segment  with the segment comprising of revenues in fiscal as compared with in fiscal this shift has historically resulted in consolidated margin improvement as the publishing segment develops and sells a greater percentage of higher margin proprietary products  however  gross margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was attributable to inventory charges taken as a result of eliminating certain specialty product offerings along with a decline of basis points in educational resources gross margins as a result of increased costs and product mix changes within that segment 
these decreases offset the gross margin gain that the company realized related to the revenue mix shift towards publishing products 
operating income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increases in operating income and operating margin were driven by the increased revenues and a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues  partially offset by the modest decrease in gross margins 
revenue revenues increased from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal  which was attributable to increases in both the educational resources and publishing segments 
educational resources segment revenues increased from million in fiscal million to million in fiscal revenue amounts for both periods were comprised solely of sales to external parties 
the increase was related to approximately million in the administrator and educator supply categories 
partially offsetting these increases was a combination of a reduction in school rebuilding in louisiana  the decision to not pursue low margin bid business and the elimination of unproductive catalogs 
in fiscal  the educational resources segment generated revenue attributable to rebuilding of schools in louisiana in the aftermath of hurricane katrina 
during fiscal  the company s volume of louisiana school rebuilding projects had been significantly reduced  resulting in a revenue decline of approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal also  the management of the educational resources segment did not pursue lower margin bid business  which typically relates to state buying organizations  in fiscal due to the low profit margins earned on this revenue and the decision to focus its efforts on pursuing higher margin business 
this decision resulted in a decline of approximately million in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal the remaining decline was primarily related to management s decision to eliminate certain catalogs in fiscal these catalogs were eliminated because the previous years versions of the catalogs were unproductive in that the costs of printing and distributing the catalogs along with other variable costs associated with order fulfillment offset most  if not all  of the gross margin generated from the incremental sales for those catalogs 
publishing segment revenues increased  or million  from million in fiscal which includes million of intersegment revenues to million in fiscal which includes million of intersegment revenues 
the increase in publishing segment revenue was attributable to million of incremental revenue from state adoptions of our science curriculums in fiscal as compared to fiscal the majority of this increase was derived from california and south carolina 
state adoption cycles occur on average every five to seven years and vary by state as to the years in which adoptions occur 
partially offsetting these gains  was an approximately million decline in our mass merchant retail business which is significantly impacted by the amount of store space our products are provided 
gross profit gross profit increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in consolidated revenue contributed million of incremental gross profit had consolidated gross margin remained constant 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in consolidated gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal this reduction in gross margin resulted in million of gross profit decline 
the decrease in consolidated gross margin was due primarily to an inventory charge of approximately million related to the company s decision to terminate certain publishing segment product lines 
educational resources segment gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in segment revenue resulted in million of incremental gross profit had segment gross margin remained constant 
however  a basis point decline in gross margin  from in fiscal to in fiscal  resulted in approximately million of a decline in gross profit 
approximately million of this decline related to a reduction of volume based vendor rebates and early pay discounts 
increased commodity costs  particularly in plywood used for certain furniture products contributed approximately million of the decrease 
the remaining decrease was primarily related to product mix shifting towards lower margin furniture business 
publishing segment gross profit increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in segment revenue resulted in approximately million of incremental gross profit had segment gross margin remained constant 
partially offsetting this increase was a basis point decrease in segment gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal  which contributed to a decline of approximately million in gross profit 
the decline in gross margin was related to a million inventory charge associated with the decision to terminate certain product lines and million of incremental product development amortization related largely to the science adoption revenue 
the impact of those charges on gross margin was partially offset by a favorable product mix within the segment  particularly for adoption revenue  which contributed approximately basis points of improved gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percent of revenues decreased basis points from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percent of revenues was primarily due to cost reduction initiatives including supply chain productivity enhancements and headcount reduction  as well as the leverage of increased sales on the non variable portion of sg a costs  partially offset by increased administrative expenses 
sg a increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in sg a costs was due primarily to the incremental variable costs associated with the million increase in revenues  costs to support the conversion to a new erp system  additional investments in the company s direct marketing and product management initiatives and increased variable performance based compensation costs as compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by cost reductions achieved through supply chain productivity enhancements and headcount reductions 
educational resources segment sg a remained constant as a percent of revenues at in both fiscal and fiscal educational resources segment sg a increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of this increase is related to additional variable costs such as transportation  warehousing  and selling expenses associated with increased revenue 
sg a also increased by approximately million in fiscal due to additional performance based compensation expense 
these sg a increases were partially offset by approximately million decrease in marketing and administrative expenses 
publishing segment sg a decreased as a percent of revenue from  or million  in fiscal to  or million in fiscal the incremental revenue in fiscal resulted in additional variable costs such as transportation  warehousing  and selling expenses of approximately million 
sg a also increased by approximately million in fiscal due to additional performance based compensation expense 
improvements in our transportation and warehousing operations provided approximately million of sg a savings in fiscal the consolidation and transfer of the information technology group from the publishing segment to corporate decreased segment sg a by million 
the remaining decrease was related primarily to declines in marketing and merchandising 
the decrease in sg a as a percent of revenue was the result of the leverage gained from reducing sg a costs even though revenue increased by over 
corporate sg a increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was mainly driven by a combination of incremental depreciation expenses associated with the new erp system of approximately million  incremental costs to support the system conversion of approximately million  which included technology costs previously included within the publishing segment  and increased variable performance based compensation expense of approximately million 
in addition  the company continued to make investments in its marketing and product management initiatives in order to provide a better overall interaction and service experience for our customers 
incremental marketing and product management costs were approximately million in fiscal net interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due to a lower effective borrowing rate attributable to the company s november  sale of million principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures due at an interest rate of 
the debentures were outstanding for all of fiscal as compared to only half of fiscal in addition  the company s revolving debt carries variable interest rates which were lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal the lower effective borrowing rates decreased interest expense by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal partially offsetting these decreases is million of incremental interest expense related to a million increase in the company s average outstanding borrowings in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in average borrowings is primarily attributable to the volume of share repurchases during fiscal exceeding the company s operating cash flows generated less cash used in investing activities 
other expense other expense  which primarily consists of the discount and loss on the accounts receivable securitization  was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the million decrease in the discount and loss was primarily due to lower effective discount rates associated with the company s securitization facility in fiscal as compared to fiscal provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due to higher pre tax income as compared to fiscal partially offset by a reduction in the effective income tax rate 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the reduction between years is primarily related to approximately million of incremental tax benefit  or of fiscal earnings before taxes  due to the favorable tax treatment of charitable contributions of inventory 
the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of in both years primarily due to the impact of state and foreign taxes 
discontinued operation as mentioned under background in this item  the company completed the sale of the school specialty media ssm business unit in fiscal  which has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations included under item in fiscal  the discontinued operation resulted in no additional income or loss  net of tax to the company 
in fiscal  the discontinued operation resulted in a million loss  net of tax 
the operations of the ssm business unit resulted in a net of tax loss of million and the sale and ultimate disposition of ssm resulted in a net of tax loss of million 
in fiscal the discontinued operation resulted in a million loss  net of tax 
the operations of the ssm business unit resulted in a net of tax loss of million and a net of tax impairment charge of million was recorded in anticipation of the intended sale 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had working capital of million 
our capitalization at april  was million and consisted of debt of million and shareholders equity of million 
our credit facility matures on february  and provides for million of revolving loan availability and million incremental term loan availability 
the amounts outstanding as of april  under the revolving and incremental term loans were million and  respectively 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains certain financial and other covenants 
our borrowings are usually significantly higher during the first two quarters of our fiscal year to meet the working capital requirements of our peak selling season 
as of april   our effective interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility was approximately  which excludes amortization of loan origination and commitment fees on unborrowed funds 
during fiscal  we incurred commitment fees on unborrowed funds under the credit facility of million and amortized loan origination fee costs of million 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a consolidated total and senior leverage ratio  a consolidated fixed charge ratio and a limitation on capital expenditures 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at april  our million  convertible subordinated notes became convertible during the second quarter of fiscal as the closing price of the company s common stock exceeded for the specified amount of time 
as a result  holders of the notes may surrender the notes for conversion at any time from october  until july  the notes are recorded as a current liability 
holders that exercise their right to convert the notes will receive up to the accreted principal amount in cash  with the balance of the conversion obligation  if any  to be satisfied in shares of company common stock or cash  at the company s discretion 
holders may require the company to repurchase the notes for cash on august   and no notes have been converted into cash or shares of common stock as of april  the notes are currently redeemable at the option of the company 
in november  we sold million of convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures are unsecured  subordinated obligations of the company  pay interest at per annum on each may th and november th  and are convertible upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
in connection with any such conversion  we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of debentures to be converted and our total conversion obligation  and will deliver  at our option  cash or shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder  if any  of our conversion obligation 
the initial conversion rate is shares per  principal amount of debentures  which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
the debentures are redeemable at our option on or after november  on november   and and upon the occurrence of certain circumstances  holders will have the right to require us to repurchase all or some of the debentures 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million from million in fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the decrease in the amount sold under the securitization facility as it was not renewed as of january  working capital increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in working capital is entirely related to the company s decision to not renew its securitization facility which resulted in a million increase in the company s accounts receivables associated with the facility 
the company s accounts receivable balances  after adjusting for the nonrenewal of the securitization facility  declined by million 
approximately million of this decline is related to the decreased revenues  with the remainder of this decline related to improvements in collections 
inventories declined million due to improvements in procurement strategies  which were partially offset by a reduction of million in accounts payables 
in addition  accrued compensation balances decreased by million  related to both the payout of fiscal variable based incentives and the reduction in headcount 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal  which included million of cash paid for the acquisition of sitton spelling 
additions to property  plant and equipment decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily a result of million decline in spending related to the implementation of the company s erp system 
spending on product development decreased by million  which is the result of the sale of the school specialty media business unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company received million during fiscal attributable to the notes received as part of the ssm sale 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the net cash used in financing activities reflects the repurchase of million shares of our common stock at a net cost of million during fiscal  compared to million shares repurchased in fiscal at a net cost of million 
the decrease in the number of our weighted average common shares outstanding due to share repurchases has had and will continue to have a positive impact on our earnings per share computations as compared to prior periods 
see part ii  item  issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information regarding share repurchases 
the increased use of cash for share repurchases was offset by additional short term borrowings 
on june  we announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program  which allows us to purchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
purchases under the share repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
common stock acquired through the share repurchase program will be available for general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations  borrowings available from our existing credit facility and other sources of capital will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for operations  including anticipated capital expenditures  share repurchases and our contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
we expect our fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately million and to consist primarily of computer hardware and software costs related to the continued implementation of the new erp platform and warehouse equipment costs 
we expect our investment in product development to be approximately million 
our amended and restated credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial covenants and places certain limitations on the repurchase of our common stock 
as of april   we were in compliance with these covenants and restrictions 
we will continue to monitor our expected ability to remain in compliance with these covenants in fiscal we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants during fiscal based on our projected financial results for fiscal and the additional action items available to us 
if we are unable to meet these covenants  our ability to access available lines of credit could be limited  our liquidity could be adversely affected and our debt obligations could be accelerated 
these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements we had an accounts receivable securitization facility 
the facility expired january  and the company elected to not renew the agreement due to the significant cost increases in accounts receivable asset backed securities markets compared to the costs of other sources of liquidity available to the company 
the company had originally entered into the facility for the purpose of reducing the company s variable rate interest expense 
however  in the current rate environment  the facility was not providing any material reduction in the company s variable rate interest expense and a renewed facility would have actually resulted in an increase to the company s variable rate interest expense 
the facility permitted advances up to million from july through november of each year  and advances up to million from december through june of each year 
at april  and april   respectively  million and million was advanced under the accounts receivable securitization and accordingly  that amount of accounts receivable has been removed from our consolidated balance sheets 
costs associated with the sale of receivables  primarily related to the discount and loss on sale  for the fiscal years  and were   and million  respectively 
the decrease in these costs was related to a combination of decreased discount rates and the termination of the securitization facility 
these costs are included as a component of other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual debt and operating lease obligations as of april  payments due in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations convertible subordinated notes capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations long term debt obligations include principal and interest payments on our credit facility and sale leaseback obligations  assuming these obligations remain outstanding until maturity at current or contractually defined interest rates 
convertible subordinated notes of  are recorded as a current liability at april  during fiscal the notes became convertible and may be surrendered for conversion at any time 
the notes could be redeemed at the option of the company no earlier than august  the amount reflected includes principal and accrued interest as of the balance sheet date only 
if the notes are held to maturity in  our obligation  including interest at current rates and accreted principal  is million 
convertible subordinated notes of  are recorded as maturing in more than five years as the bonds are not currently convertible 
the notes can be redeemed at the option of the company no earlier than november  the amounts reflected for these notes include accrued interest at the balance sheet date and interest at through november  as of april   we did not have any material long term purchase obligations 
the short term purchase obligations the company had as of april  were primarily for the purchase of inventory in the normal course of business 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our business is subject to seasonal influences 
our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our fiscal year  primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in our costs for the products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies we acquire may differ substantially from our own  which could contribute to further fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for fiscal years and in thousands  except per share data 
we derived this quarterly data from our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
fiscal first second third fourth total revenues gross profit operating income loss earnings loss from continuing operations  net of income taxes net income loss basic earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations total diluted earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations total fiscal first second third fourth total revenues gross profit operating income loss earnings loss from continuing operations  net of income taxes loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income loss basic earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations total diluted earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations total inflation inflation  particularly in fuel and other oil related costs  has had and could continue to have an effect on our results of operations and our internal and external sources of liquidity 
critical accounting policies we believe the policies identified below are critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business are discussed throughout md a where applicable 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base them on a combination of historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition revenue  net of estimated returns and allowances  is recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers  the selling price is fixed  the customer is obligated to pay and we have no significant remaining obligations 
cash received in advance from customers is deferred on our balance sheet as a current liability and recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to the customers 
catalog costs and related amortization we spend over million annually to produce and distribute catalogs 
we accumulate all direct costs incurred  net of vendor cooperative advertising payments  in the development  production and circulation of our catalogs on our balance sheet until such time as the related catalog is mailed 
they are subsequently amortized into sg a over the expected sales realization cycle  which is one year or less 
consequently  any difference between our estimated and actual revenue stream for a particular catalog and the related impact on amortization expense is neutralized within a period of one year or less 
our estimate of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular catalog is based on  among other possible considerations  our historical sales experience with identical or similar catalogs and our assessment of prevailing economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we track our subsequent sales realization  reassess the marketplace  and compare our findings to our previous estimate and adjust the amortization of our future catalogs  if necessary 
development costs we accumulate external and certain internal costs incurred in the development of our products which can include a master copy of a book  video or other media  on our balance sheet 
as of april   we had million in net development costs on our balance sheet 
a majority of these costs are associated with publishing and science businesses 
the capitalized development costs are subsequently amortized into cost of revenues over the expected sales realization cycle of the products  which is typically five years 
during fiscal  we amortized development costs of million to expense related to our continuing businesses 
we continue to monitor the expected sales realization cycle for each product  and will adjust the remaining expected life of the development costs or recognize an impairment  if warranted 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge related to product development costs at our ssm business unit in addition to a million impairment charge related to product development costs at ssm recorded in fiscal goodwill and intangible assets  and long lived assets at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
we review our goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as it relates to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 the recoverability of these assets is subject to a fair value assessment which includes judgments regarding financial projections  including forecasted cash flows and discount rates  and comparable market values 
as it relates to finite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which also requires significant judgments related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset 
key assumptions used in the impairment analysis include but are not limited too expected future cash flows  business plan projections  revenue growth rates  and the discount rate utilized for discounting such cash flows 
the impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and  thus  the estimated recoverability  or impairment  if any  of the asset 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
we test goodwill for possible impairment by determining the fair value of the company s reporting units 
we estimate fair value using discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach 
a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are estimated based on past acquisition history and the company s assessment of the current and proposed valuations for related market transactions 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
the company s stock price and an estimated control premium are two factors that can significantly impact the fair value assessment of the company s reporting units 
the significant decline in the general global economic conditions has led to volatility in the company s stock price during fiscal during this period  our stock price fluctuated between a high of per share and a low of per share 
the company considers its market capitalization and estimated control premium in its goodwill impairment analysis 
the fair value of other indefinite life intangible assets are estimated and compared to the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relief from royalty method  which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual budgets  assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the intangible assets  and a discount rate 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
during fiscal  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge  a million intangible asset impairment charge and a million impairment of property  plant and equipment related to the ssm business unit in addition to a million goodwill impairment charge related to ssm recorded in fiscal as of april   no remaining goodwill or intangible assets were recorded as assets related to ssm 
the impairment charge related to ssm was the result of deteriorating financial performance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors authorized the sale of ssm which was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal we have reflected ssm as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations under item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our borrowings under our credit facility and our discount expense related to our accounts receivable securitization were primarily dependent upon libor rates 
assuming no change in our financial structure  if variable interest rates were to have averaged basis points higher during fiscal and fiscal  pre tax earnings would have decreased by approximately million and million respectively 
this amount was determined by considering a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on average variable rate debt outstanding and the average advanced under the accounts receivable securitization facility during fiscal and fiscal the estimated fair value of long term debt approximated its carrying value at april  and april   with the exception of our convertible debt which at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million and at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million
