the company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason  except as required by law 
overview we are a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems  primarily for the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
we also leverage the specialized skill sets required to support semiconductor capital equipment to serve the technologically similar markets in the flat panel  solar and medical device industries  collectively referred to as other addressed industries 
we develop  design  prototype  engineer  manufacture and test subsystems which are highly specialized and tailored to specific steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process as well as the manufacturing process in other addressed industries 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems including chemical mechanical planarization cmp subsystems  chemical delivery modules  top plate assemblies  frame assemblies  process modules and other high level assemblies 
the recent weakening global economy  severe tightening of the credit markets and turmoil in the financial markets are contributing to slowdowns in the markets we serve 
uncertainty regarding future growth in economies throughout the world have caused companies to reduce capital investment  the impact of which has been particularly severe in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
this economic uncertainty has led our customers to push out  cancel  or refrain from placing orders with us  which in turn has reduced our sales and negatively impacted our cash flow 
our sales were million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year four customers applied materials  inc  intuitive surgical  inc  lam research corporation and novellus systems  inc  accounted for of our sales for fiscal year we incurred a net loss of million  which included a charge for impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets of million  for the year ended january  and we expect to incur additional losses in the future 
we expect an unusually challenging environment for fiscal and expect sequential revenues to be lower in the first quarter of results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue year ended january  december  december  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative impairment of goodwill impairment of long lived assets total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss 
table of contents year ended january  compared with year ended december  sales sales for the year ended january  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in sales reflects a decrease in semi conductor equipment demand as a result of the overall slowdown in the industry  partially offset by sequential minor increases in non semiconductor revenue 
we expect sequential revenues to be lower in the first quarter of gross profit cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead  including depreciation  associated with the design and manufacture of products sold 
gross profit for the year ended january  decreased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to declining unit volume manufactured due to declining sales during fiscal year  lower factory utilization  costs associated with the centralization and closure of our facilities and employee severance charges resulting from a series of reductions in force 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of activities related to new component testing and evaluation  test equipment  design and implementation  new product design and testing and other product development activities 
research and development expense remained relatively flat decreasing to million  or of sales  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of sales for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of sales was due primarily to a lower revenue base in as compared to sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our sales and service employees  salaries paid to our engineers who work with our sales and service employees to help determine the components and configuration requirements for new products and other costs related to the sales of our products 
sales and marketing expense was million and million for the years ended january  and december   respectively 
the decreased spending was due primarily to reduced travel expense and sales commissions offset by an increase in severance payments 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expense increased to for the year ended january  compared to for the year ended december  due to the lower revenue base in compared as to general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and overhead of our administrative staff and professional fees 
general and administrative expense decreased to million  or of sales  for the year ended january   from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in spending was due to lower outside service costs of approximately million resulting from reduced accounting and consulting costs related to sox compliance and reduced legal fees as the legal proceedings discussed in item legal proceedings were finalized in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by increases in facility expenses related to the move to our new facility in hayward  california in mid fiscal  higher depreciation costs due to the implementation of our new erp system in late fiscal and employee severance charges resulting from a series of reductions in force 
impairment of goodwill during the current year  as a result of our annual impairment test of goodwill  we determined that the carrying amount of certain reporting units exceeded their fair value resulting in impairment charges of million to goodwill see note to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that an adverse change in our business climate required us to test the recoverability of our long lived assets 
as a result of these tests we determined that the carrying amount of certain reporting units had exceeded their fair value resulting in impairment charges of million for other intangible assets and million for property  plant and equipment 
see note to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net for the year ended january  was million compared to million in components of interest and other income expense relate primarily to the interest expense incurred for debt financing 
interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million in the decrease in was due primarily to a decrease in interest rates on debt 
this decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in interest income of approximately million 
income tax provision our effective tax rate for the year ended january  was compared to for the year ended december  our effective tax rate is substantially impacted by several items including section deduction for domestic production activities  state taxes and the effect of foreign operations  and in the fourth quarter ended january   our effective tax rate was impacted by the impairment of goodwill for which there is no tax benefit 
the decreased rate in reflects primarily the impact of our goodwill impairment charge as well as a change in our geographic mix of us and china earnings 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase reflects continued market penetration and strong demand in the first six months of  offset  in part  by a decrease in demand resulting from the overall slowdown in the semiconductor capital equipment market in the second half of the increase includes incremental revenue of million derived from the acquisition of uct sieger 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  gross profit for the year ended reflects a correction in inventory resulting from incorrect material transfers in our newly implemented erp system  which increased our cost of goods sold by million and decreased gross margins by from the reported in our earnings release dated february  the increase in gross profit from was due primarily to an increase in revenues  net of a decrease of approximately million resulting from a reduction in gross margins  primarily from our us operations 
the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to declining  sequential quarterly revenue which began the first quarter of fiscal a contributing factor to the decrease in the gross margin in related to the increase in sfas r stock based compensation expense of million 
research and development expense research and development expense remained relatively flat decreasing to million  or of sales  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of sales for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of sales was due primarily to a higher revenue base in as compared to sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the increased spending was due primarily to approximately million in additional compensation expense as a result of increases in sales and service headcount to support higher revenue including the 
table of contents sieger revenue 
the balance of the increase was attributed primarily to increased travel expenses of million and million of sfas r stock compensation expense 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expense increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased to million  or of sales  for the year ended december  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the increase in spending was due to increases in labor costs of million in part related to the addition of uct sieger administrative personnel as well as increases in administrative personnel related to our china facilities 
the increase is also due to accounting and consulting costs related to sox compliance of million  legal fees related primarily to legal proceedings described above in item legal proceedings of million and sfas r stock compensation expenses of million 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net for the year ended december  was million compared to million in components of interest and other income expense relate primarily to the interest expense incurred for debt financing related to the sieger acquisition 
interest expense for the year was million compared to million in the increase in was due to interest on debt incurred for a full year in compared to interest on debt incurred for only a part of as a result of the acquisition of sieger in june this increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income of approximately million as well as a decrease in other expense of approximately million 
other expense in fiscal included approximately million of stock offering expenses related to our secondary offering in the first quarter of income tax provision our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  our effective tax rate is substantially impacted by several items including section deduction for domestic production activities  state taxes and the effect of foreign operations 
the decreased rate in reflects primarily a change in our geographic mix of us and china earnings 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales  inventories  intangible assets  stock compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  business combinations  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill and equity incentives to employees to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition our revenue is highly concentrated in four oem customers in the semiconductor capital equipment  solar  flat panel and medical device industries 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  no right of return of delivered products and no customer acceptance provisions 
revenue from sales of products is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we ship the products  
table of contents customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product 
in arrangements which specify title transfer upon delivery  revenue is not recognized until the product is delivered 
in addition  if we have not fulfilled the terms of the agreement at the time of shipment  revenue recognition is deferred until completion 
determination of criteria in the third and fourth bullet points above is based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the amounts charged for the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of  and do not require collateral from  our customers 
we have not experienced significant collection losses in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to assess collectability 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lesser of standard cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of our estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
the inventory write downs are recorded as an inventory valuation allowance established on the basis of obsolete inventory or specific identified inventory in excess of established usage 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold either as a component of a subsystem or as separate inventory 
for the years ended january  and december   we wrote off million and million  respectively  in inventory determined to be obsolete 
accounting for income taxes the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which is made up primarily of tax deductions  assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these deductions 
in determining whether the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  we make judgments with respect to whether we are likely to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowance to impair our tax assets because  based on the available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets in the future 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
we adopted the provision of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 as of january  prior to adoption  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the best estimate of known tax contingencies 
fin no 
requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
fin no 
requires us to recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of success upon settlement 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and related regulations 
accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
the company s state income tax return is currently under examination by the california franchise tax board cftb and the company s tax return is currently under examination by the cftb and the internal revenue service 
the company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the internal revenue service for fiscal year and the company s state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the fiscal years through 
table of contents business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets such as trade name and customer relationships 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets we evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  at least annually  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  such as an adverse change in our business climate or a decline in the overall industry  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company s intangible assets include goodwill  customer lists and tradename 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the provisions of sfas no 
require a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  the provisions of sfas no 
require the application of a fair value based test at the reporting unit level 
we operate in one reportable segment and have one reporting unit 
therefore  all goodwill is considered enterprise goodwill and the first step of the impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires a comparison of our fair value to our book value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the book value  sfas no 
requires an estimate of the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
this estimate requires valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in process research and development and developed technology 
potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon this two step process 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 the company tests other long lived assets  including property  equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group 
if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable  the company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach  which is the present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flow produced by each asset group  and compare it to its carrying value 
the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value 
the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value 
see additional disclosure of these analyses in note to our consolidated financial statements including the impairment charges recorded during the quarter ended january  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill or long lived assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as  but not limited to  the reporting unit at which goodwill should be measured for impairment and the asset group to be tested for recoverability 
the company is also required to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses 
such estimates include  but are not limited to  future operating performance and cash flows  cost of capital  terminal values  control premiums and remaining economic lives of assets 

table of contents equity incentives to employees we have accounted for stock based compensation under statement of financial accounting standards sfas r revised share based payment sfas r and sec staff accounting bulletin sab which requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model that we use was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of underlying stock 
our expect stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of our common stock 
we determined that historical volatility reflects market conditions and is a good indicator of future volatility 
our expected term represents the period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on our historical experience with similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards and vesting schedules 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 
unaudited quarterly financial results the following tables set forth statement of operations data  in thousands  for the periods indicated 
the information for each of these periods is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements included herein and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our unaudited operations data for the periods presented 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future in thousands first second third fourth fiscal quarter quarter quarter quarter year sales gross profit net income loss sales gross profit net income our operating results for fiscal reflect a downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry beginning in the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources with the exception of the sieger acquisition  which was funded by third party debt  historically  we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs  satisfy our debt obligations  maintain our equipment and purchase new capital equipment 
as of january   we had cash of million compared to million as of december  for the year ended january  we generated cash from operating activities of million compared to million for the year ended december  operating cash flow in was unfavorably impacted by our net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million and an increase in prepaid and other assets of million 
operating cash flows were favorably impacted by net non cash activity of million  including changes in and impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets of million  depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively  stock based compensation of million and increased net deferred income taxes of million  decreases in accounts receivable and inventory of million  million  respectively  and an increase in current liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended january  increased million to million from million in the year ended december  due primarily to our investment in equipment and leasehold improvements in our new hayward  california facility 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities for the year ended january  increased million to million from million in the year ended december  our use of cash in financing activities was primarily due to payments on short term and long term debt of million and million  respectively  and the repurchase of common stock of million see note to consolidated financial statements  offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our employee stock compensation plans of million 
during fiscal  we took steps to reduce our operating costs in line with our declining revenues in the form of factory shutdowns  reductions in headcount and other cost cutting measures 
we will continue to monitor the state of the current economic crisis and its impact on our business and will make additional cost reductions as deemed necessary to align revenues and expenses and ensure we maintain sufficient funds to effectively run the business 
we anticipate that our existing cash balances and operating cash flow  together with available borrowings under our credit facility as amended on february  see borrowing arrangements below  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of these resources to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth  the state of the worldwide economy  the cyclical expansion or contraction of the semiconductor capital equipment industry and the other industries we serve and capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products 
borrowing arrangements in connection with our acquisition of sieger in the second quarter of  we entered into a borrowing arrangement and a term loan loan agreement 
the loan agreement provided senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to million  consisting of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan original term loan 
the outstanding balance of the revolving line of credit as of january   was approximately million 
the balance of our original term loan as of january   was million and will expire on june  interest rates on outstanding loans under the credit facilities ranged from to per annum during the year ended january  and were per annum as of january  we also have a million equipment loan that is secured by certain of our equipment and expires may the interest rate and outstanding balance on the equipment loan was and million  respectively  as of january  the combined balance outstanding on the loan agreement and equipment loan at january  was million 
on february   the company amended its loan agreement consisting of a reduction of the revolving credit facility from million to million while extending its maturity to january   and a new million three year term loan  as amended  also maturing on january  the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory total eligible inventory not to exceed million and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the revolving credit facility bears interest per annum at a variable rate equal to the greater of the bank s stated prime rate or plus a margin of basis points 
the new term loan  as amended  bears interest per annum at a variable rate equal to the greater of the bank s stated prime rate or plus a margin of basis points 
the revolving credit facility contains certain reporting and financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth and liquidity ratios  that must be met on a monthly basis in order for the company to remain in compliance 
capital expenditures we made capital expenditures of million in the year ended january   million of which was used for our new headquarters in hayward  california and million was used for expansion of our facilities in china 
capital expenditures of million in the year ended december  was used primarily for facilities expansion in china and the implementation of our new erp system which went live during the fourth quarter of capital expenditures in the year ended december  were million  the majority of which was used for domestic cleanroom expansion activities and the purchase and implementation of a new erp system 

table of contents contractual obligations other than operating leases for certain equipment and real estate  we have no off balance sheet transactions  unconditional purchase obligations or similar instruments and  other than the revolving credit facility described above  are not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations 
the following table summarizes our future minimum lease payments and principal payments under debt obligations as of january  in thousands thereafter total capital lease operating lease borrowing arrangements purchase obligations total operating lease expense reflects a the lease for our headquarters facility in hayward  california  b the lease for a manufacturing facility in portland  oregon that expires on october   c the leases for manufacturing facilities in south san francisco expire in and  d the leases for manufacturing facilities in austin  texas that expire in and we have options to renew certain of the leases in south san francisco  which we expect to exercise 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on december  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recorded an additional tax liability of million to offset the recognition of previously recorded excess tax benefits 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the future payment of these liabilities  the amounts have been excluded from the table above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of financial instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
foreign exchange rates currently  a significant majority of our sales and arrangements with third party suppliers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to material exchange rate fluctuations 
therefore  we do not expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to have a material effect on our results of operations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
interest rates our interest rate risk relates primarily to our third party debt which totals million and carries interest rates pegged to the libor and prime rates 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would increase our interest expense by approximately  per quarter 
this would be partially offset by increased interest income on our invested cash 
conversely  an immediate decline of basis points in interest rates would decrease our interest expense by approximately  per quarter 
this would be partially offset by decreased interest income on our invested cash
