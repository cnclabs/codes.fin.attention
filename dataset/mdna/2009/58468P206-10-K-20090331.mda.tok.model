you should read the following discussion and analysis together with item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual repot on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under the caption item a 
risk factors 
overview background we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and developing novel  small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical need with a specific focus on the us market 
through strategic alliances primarily with japanese pharmaceutical companies  we hold rights to a diversified portfolio of clinical and preclinical product candidates  each of which we believe has a well characterized and differentiated therapeutic profile  attractive commercial potential and patent assets having claims of commercially adequate scope 
we are a development stage company 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
at december   from inception  our accumulated deficit was approximately million  including million of non cash stock based compensation charges related to employee stock based compensation and founders warrants 
we expect to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our existing product candidates and over the long term as we expand our research and development programs and acquire or in license products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 
revenues and cost of revenues we have not generated any revenues from licensing  milestones or product sales to date  and we do not expect to generate any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates within the next several years  if at all 
our revenues to date have been generated from providing development management services under master service agreements with asahi kasei pharma corporation and argenes  inc  pursuant to which we billed consulting fees and our pass through clinical contract costs 
the primary costs associated with our revenue were the clinical contract costs we incurred and passed through to our customer 
our agreement with asahi kasei pharma corporation has been completed  and we terminated our agreement with argenes  inc therefore  we will not generate any further revenue from these agreements 

table of contents research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of the license fees related to our product candidates  salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates  costs associated with non clinical activities  such as regulatory expenses  and pre commercialization manufacturing development activities 
we use external service providers to manufacture our product candidates to be used in clinical trials and for the majority of the services performed in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates  therefore  these research and development expenses consist substantially of external costs  such as fees paid to consultants  contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and other external service providers  including professional fees and costs associated with legal services  patents and patent applications for our intellectual property 
internal research and development expenses consist of costs of compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies  materials  facility costs and depreciation 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on certain contractual factors such as for estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  accruals are adjusted 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods indicated for each of our product candidates 
to the extent that costs  including personnel costs  are not tracked to a specific product development program  such costs are included in the unallocated category in thousands product candidate disease indication year ended december  mn acute exacerbations of asthma mn multiple sclerosis mn bronchial asthma mn interstitial cystitis mn solid tumors mn generalized anxiety disorder insomnia mn preterm labor mn urinary incontinence mn thrombotic disorders mn thrombotic disorders socc cancer  inflammatory diseases unallocated total research and development as of the end of the second quarter of  we determined to focus our resources on the development of our two prioritized product candidates  mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and mn for the treatment of ms 
however  following completion of the phase ii clinical trial of mn for the treatment of ms in the second quarter of  we have not undertaken  nor do we plan to undertake  any further significant clinical development of mn until such time that we secure a strategic collaboration to advance mn into phase iii clinical development 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase with respect to mn in future periods as we continue development and launch clinical trials in support of potential commercialization of this product candidate and decrease with respect to mn in future periods as we will limit expenditures on this product candidate to those development activities deemed necessary  if any  to maximize its value for purposes of securing a partner for phase iii clinical development 
however  at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical development process and given the early stage of our mn product development program  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs that we will incur in the continued development of such product candidate for potential commercialization 

table of contents we intend to limit our expenditures on the remainder of our existing product candidates to only those activities deemed necessary to maintain our license rights or maximize the value of such product candidates  if any  while pursuing a variety of initiatives to monetize such product candidates on appropriate terms 
as a result  we expect that research and development expenses will decrease or otherwise remain low for the remainder of our existing product candidates in future periods 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries  benefits and consulting and professional fees related to our administrative  finance  human resources  business development  legal and information systems support functions 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include facilities and insurance costs 
general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on monitoring the status of the specified project  contractual factors such as milestones or retainer fees  services provided and invoices received 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  general and administrative accruals have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we expand our infrastructure and incur additional costs for insurance and professional and consulting fees associated with operating as a dual listed public company and supporting our product development programs and business development activities 
impairment charge  net on long term investments and long term asset our impairment charge consists of loss recognized on our long term investments as a result of other than temporary declines in the fair value of such securities  offset by the gain attributable to our ars put pursuant to the ars rights offer described below 
our long term investments consist of auction rate securities  or ars  all of which had aaa ratings at the time of purchase  that principally represent interests in municipal bonds  government guaranteed student loans  insurance notes and portfolios of securities primarily commercial paper and our long term asset consists of an ars put 
at december   million of our ars consisted primarily of municipal bonds and government guaranteed student loan securities and million of our ars consisted of private placement securities 
none of the underlying collateral for our ars consisted of subprime mortgages or collateralized debt obligations 
our ars were designated as trading securities and have been classified as long term given the time frame in which we can readily convert these securities into cash 
ars are generally long term debt instruments that historically have provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  typically seven   or days 
through december   only our ars consisting of private placement securities had experienced failed auctions 
however  in february  all of our ars began experiencing failed auctions 
due to continued negative conditions in the global credit markets  our ars have continued to fail at auction with few to no trades in either the primary or the secondary markets 
as such  with the required adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 fair value measurements  as of january   we determined the fair value of our ars portfolio primarily on level criteria  which resulted in our reliance on a discounted cash flow valuation model with assumptions related to interest rates  maturities and liquidity determined by us based on the credit quality of the security  the credit quality of the associated insurer  if applicable  the respective prospectus and the credit market outlook 
see note  fair value measurements  of our financial statements on page for further information regarding the valuation of our ars 
in august  ubs ag and its affiliates  or ubs  the brokerage firm through which we purchased the majority of our ars investments  entered into a settlement with the sec  the new york attorney general and other state agencies 
under the settlement  ubs issued to us auction rate security rights  which would allow us 
table of contents to sell to ubs our ars held in accounts with ubs  or ars rights offer 
pursuant to the ars rights offer  we received the right to sell to ubs the ars held in accounts with ubs at par value at any time during the period beginning june  and ending july   or ars put 
as part of the settlement  ubs also offered to us a no net cost loan program  or ars loan  whereby we would be able to borrow up to percent of the market value  as determined by ubs at its sole discretion  of our ars that have been pledged as collateral at an interest cost that would not exceed the interest being paid on the underlying ars investments 
under the ars loan program  ubs may demand full or partial payment of the ars loan  at its sole option and without cause  at any time 
in november  we accepted the ars rights offer 
in january  we were approved for the ars loan in the amount of million and drew down the entire preapproved amount 
in addition  in february  we borrowed an additional million under the ars loan  bringing the total amount outstanding under the ars loan to million  following ubs decision to increase our availability under the ars loan 
all cash received under the ars loan was invested in money market accounts 
although we have the right to sell to ubs the ars subject to the ars put at par beginning june   we determined the fair market value of the respective ars without consideration of the ars put because they are separate contractual agreements under sfas no 
as of december   the carry value of all of our ars had been reduced by million  from million to million  to reflect the estimated change in fair market value due primarily to a lack of liquidity 
although our ars continue to pay interest according to their stated interest terms  we deemed the reduction of the overall fair value of our ars portfolio as other than temporary due to the continued illiquidity of the primary ars market and our expectation as to when we may be required to liquidate our ars for operating purposes 
we elected to measure the ars put under the fair value option of sfas no 
to mitigate the volatility in reported earnings due to the linkage of certain of our ars and the ars put 
the fair value of the ars put was also determined by a discounted cash flow valuation model with assumptions being made related to interest rate  maturity and liquidity 
based on our discounted cash flow valuation  we recorded a gain of million in our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we recorded the ars put as a long term asset in our consolidated balance sheet  given that the ars put is not exercisable until june at the earliest 
foreign exchange loss to date  we have conducted most of our clinical trials in the united states 
however  the phase ii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of ms was conducted in eastern europe 
when we entered into the euro denominated contract with the cro managing this clinical trial on our behalf  the us dollar to euro conversion rate had remained fairly constant  therefore  we did not enter into a hedging program to mitigate our foreign exchange exposure at such time 
we completed this clinical trial in the second quarter of our foreign exchange loss in is attributable to the decline in the value of the us dollar against the euro and is reflected in the remaining accrued payable for this foreign currency contract 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to our significant accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting estimates include our recognition of research and development expenses  which impacts operating expenses and accrued liabilities  and stock based compensation  which impacts operating expenses 
we review our estimates  judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to further our research and development activities and include salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with clinical trials  costs associated with non clinical activities such as toxicology testing  regulatory activities  research related overhead expenses and fees paid to external service providers who conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf 
we use external service providers and vendors to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates to be used in clinical trials and to provide various other products and services related to our product development programs 
research and development expenses also include fees for licensed technology for which technological feasibility has not been established and there are no alternative uses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on certain contractual factors such as for estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  accruals are adjusted 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
long term investments and long term asset our long term investments consist of ars  all of which had aaa ratings at the time of purchase  that principally represent interests in municipal bonds  government guaranteed student loans  insurance notes and portfolios of securities primarily commercial paper  and our long term asset consists of the ars put 
at december   million of our ars consisted primarily of municipal bonds and government guaranteed student loan securities and million of our ars consisted of private placement securities 
none of the underlying collateral for our ars consisted of subprime mortgages or collateralized debt obligations 
at december   our ars were designated as trading securities and classified as long term given the estimated time frame in which we can readily convert these securities into cash 
ars are generally long term debt instruments that historically have provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  typically seven   or days 
due to continued negative conditions in the global credit markets  our ars have continued to fail at auction with few trades in either the primary or the secondary markets 
as such  with the required adoption of sfas no 
as of january   we determined the fair value of our ars portfolio primarily on level criteria as prescribed by the accounting standard  which resulted in our reliance on a discounted cash flow valuation model with assumptions related to interest rates  maturities and liquidity determined by us based on the credit quality of the security  the credit quality of the associated insurer  if applicable  the respective prospectuses  and the credit market outlook 
our discounted cash flow valuation model took into consideration liquidity discounts ranging between three percent to percent  libor and day treasury bill rates at december  and assumed a portfolio maturity of seven years 
we elected to measure the ars put which is our right  pursuant to the ubs ars rights offer  to sell to ubs our ars held in accounts with ubs at par value at any time during the period beginning june  under the fair value option of sfas to mitigate the volatility in reported earnings due to the linkage of certain of our ars and the ars put 
the fair value of the ars put was also determined by a discounted cash flow valuation model effectively using a liquidity discount of approximately seven percent  an interest rate of approximately five percent which took into consideration the brokerage firm s weighted average cost of capital and a maturity of one and one half years  given the earliest exercise date of the ars put is june 
table of contents stock based compensation we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our amended and restated stock incentive plan 
additionally  we have outstanding stock options that were granted under our general stock incentive plan 
the benefits provided under both of these plans are subject to the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires stock based compensation for an award of equity instruments  including stock options and employee stock purchase rights  issued to employees to be recognized as a cost in the consolidated financial statements 
the cost of these awards is measured according to the grant date fair value of the stock award and is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
in the absence of an observable market price for the stock award  the grant date fair value of the award would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r require us to estimate certain variables  such as estimated volatility and expected life 
if any of our estimations change  such changes could have a significant impact on the stock based compensation amount we recognize 
prior to  we accounted for employee stock options and warrants using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  results from stock option and warrant issuances at exercise prices below the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock 
with respect to stock options  we recognize this compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option  generally four years 
new accounting standards not yet adopted the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas no 
r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas no 
will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas no 
r and sfas no 
are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year early adoption is not permitted 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r on our consolidated financial statements will depend on the economic terms of any future business combinations transactions 
we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues for the year ended december  or december  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in 
table of contents research and development expenses primarily resulted from our business decision to focus on the development of our two prioritized assets  mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and mn for the treatment of ms 
this decrease in research and development expenses primarily resulted from the following a decrease of million related to the termination of a phase iii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of bronchial asthma  a decrease of million related to the completion of the phase ii clinical trial for insomnia and the ceased further clinical development of mn for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder insomnia  and a decrease of million due to the completion of the two year phase ii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of ms  and a decrease of million related primarily to the completion of clinical trials for mn for the treatment of solid tumors  mn for the treatment of preterm labor and mn for the treatment of urinary incontinence  which decrease was offset primarily by a net increase of million related to the conduct of phase ii clinical trials for mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in stock based compensation and a million decrease related to reduced administrative headcount and fees paid to third party consultants 
impairment charge  net on long term investments and long term asset for the year ended december   we recorded a million other than temporary write down of the carrying value of our ars based upon a discounted cash flow valuation analysis of our entire ars portfolio conducted on a security by security basis  the outlook of the ars market and our expectation as to when we may be required to liquidate our ars for operating purposes  which was offset by a gain of million recognized on the ars put which is linked to certain of our ars 
foreign exchange loss at december   the conversion rate was approximately us dollars for each euro  which approximated the conversion rate at the time we entered into the contract with the cro managing our phase ii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of ms which was completed in the second quarter of at december   the conversion rate was approximately us dollars for each euro  and we reduced the accrued liability related to this clinical research contract based on reconciliations performed through year end 
this resulted in a million foreign exchange loss related to the revaluation of our euro denominated liability for the year ended december  interest income interest income primarily consisted of income earned on our cash and investment balances and totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a decrease in our investment balances and overall lower yields on our investments due to the economic recession 

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues for the year ended december   a decrease of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was due to a lack of activity under our master services agreement with argenes  inc  which was terminated in june research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of million related to the advancement and subsequent termination of a phase iii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of bronchial asthma  an increase of million related to the completion of a phase ii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of insomnia  an increase of million in our prioritized drug development program for mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma primarily related to the advancement of a phase ii clinical trial and market research  an increase of million in our prioritized drug development program for mn for the treatment of ms primarily related to preclinical studies  manufacturing of drug  market research and consulting services  an increase of in our other drug development programs and unallocated research and development expenditures  and an increase of million in stock based compensation  which increase was offset by million related to the completion of clinical trials related to the product development programs for mn for the treatment of solid tumors  mn for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder  mn for the treatment of ic and mn for the treatment of urinary incontinence 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of million of stock based compensation expense  and an increase of million in compensation related expenses due to salaries and severance payments  which increase was offset by a decrease of million in legal fees and a decrease of million in financial advisor and other fees 
interest income interest income primarily consisted of income earned on our cash and investment balances 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to decreased investment balances and lower rates of return on our investments 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and a long term asset consisting of the ars put as compared to million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale as of december   which decrease of million was primarily a result of our operating loss of million 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale as compared to million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale at december   which decrease of million was primarily a result of our operating loss of million offset by the aggregate proceeds received from our public offering of common stock in february net cash used in operating activities amounted to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the net loss incurred during the year ended december  of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  consisted of million related to the net maturity of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the net proceeds received from our employee stock purchase plan 
our future capital uses and requirements will depend on  and could increase significantly as a result of  many forward looking factors  including the following progress of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  including expenses to support the clinical development of mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and milestone payments that may become payable to kissei pharmaceutical based on the progress of such product development program  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including licensing and other arrangements  the scope  prioritization and number of our product development programs  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical and commercial production of our product candidates  the costs of establishing sales and marketing capabilities and commercialization activities if we obtain regulatory clearances to market our product candidates  and the extent to which we may in license  acquire or invest in other indications  products  technologies and businesses 
until we can generate significant continuing revenues  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through strategic collaborations  private or public sales of our securities  debt financings or licensing transactions  involving all or a portion of our product candidates  to the extent we are able to do so 
we cannot be certain that additional sources of capital will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if sources of capital are not available  we may not be in a position to pursue present or future business opportunities that require financial commitments  and we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or terminate one or more of our product development programs or our commercialization efforts  curtail our efforts to acquire new product candidates or relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates 

table of contents sources of liquidity since our inception  our operations have been financed primarily through the private placement of our equity securities and through the public sale of our common stock  net of treasury stock repurchases 
over the three years ended december   we have completed the following sales of equity securities on march   we issued and sold  shares of common stock to a founder in exercise of warrants for aggregate proceeds of approximately million  in august  we issued and sold  shares of common stock to a founder in exercise of warrants and we issued  shares to a former employee in exercise of stock options for aggregate proceeds of approximately million  and on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and certain other costs associated with the offering 
in february  april and august  a founder exercised warrants to purchase   and  shares of our common stock  respectively  at per share in cashless exercises that resulted in the issuance of   and  shares of common stock  respectively 
in january  a founder exercised warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share in a cashless exercise that resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
in september  a founder exercised warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share in a cashless exercise that resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
at december   no underlying shares of common stock remained subject to purchase under the terms of the founders warrants 
auction rate securities 
at december   our long term investments included million at par value of ars 
with the continued negative conditions in the global credit markets  these ars have experienced multiple failed auctions  as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
as a result of the failed auctions  these securities are currently not liquid in the primary market 
the majority of our ars are secured by parts of government guaranteed student loans  and all of our ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms generally basis points over the day us treasury bill rate or basis points over libor with interest rates resetting every seven to days 
while it is not our intent to hold our ars until their ultimate stated maturities  these securities are scheduled to mature between and because an active primary market for ars does not exist  we utilized a discounted cash flow valuation model utilizing liquidity discounts ranging from three percent to percent to determine the estimated fair value of our ars investments on a security by security basis 
we also took into consideration the brokerage firm s pricing model  if applicable  the tax status taxable vs 
tax exempt of the security  credit quality of the issuer  assumed maturity seven years  insurance wraps and the portfolio composition 
we also made assumptions regarding future cash flows and the likelihood of the ars being redeemed or refinanced 
although our ars continue to pay interest at their stated terms  we have recognized a realized loss of million in our consolidated statement of operations based on our determination that the loss of value was an other than temporary impairment  net of a gain realized on our ars put described below 
the carrying value in long term investments for these ars at december  was million 
ars rights offer  ars put and ars loan 
in august  ubs  the brokerage firm through which we purchased the majority of our ars investments  entered into a settlement with the sec  the new york attorney general and other state agencies 
under the settlement  ubs issued to us the ars rights offer 
pursuant to the ars rights offer  we received the ars put 
as part of the settlement  ubs also offered to us the ars loan  whereby we would be able to borrow up to percent of the market value  as determined by ubs at its sole discretion  of our ars that have been pledged as collateral at an interest cost that would not exceed the interest 
table of contents being paid on the underlying ars investments 
under the ars loan program  ubs may demand full or partial payment of the ars loan  at its sole option and without cause  at any time 
in november  we accepted the ars rights offer 
in january  we were approved for the ars loan in the amount of million and drew down the entire preapproved amount 
in addition  in february  we borrowed an additional million under the ars loan  bringing the total amount outstanding under the ars loan to million  following ubs decision to increase our availability under the ars loan 
all cash received under the ars loan was invested in money market accounts 
we elected to measure the ars put under the fair value option of sfas no 
to mitigate the volatility in reported earnings due to the linkage of certain of our ars and the ars put 
the fair value of the ars put was also determined by a discounted cash flow valuation model effectively using a liquidity discount of approximately seven percent and an interest rate of approximately five percent  which took into consideration the brokerage firm s weighted average cost of capital 
based on our discounted cash flow valuation  we recorded a gain of million in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of our ars and the ars put are based in part on management s estimates and assumptions 
in the event of actual market exchanges  if any  these assumptions may prove materially different from those assumed in our valuation models and amounts may be materially different than our estimates 
for example  a reduction of the expected term to redemption by two years for our ars portfolio yielded in our models a net increase in valuation of our ars of million and an increase in expected term to redemption by two years for our ars portfolio yielded in our model a decrease in valuation of our ars of million 
other factors that may impact the valuation of our ars and the ars put include changes to the credit quality of the underlying assets  discount rates  counterparty risk and the condition of the overall credit market 
capital resources we have consumed substantial amounts of capital since our inception 
our current cash and cash equivalent balances are our principal sources of liquidity 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of december  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating requirements through at least december  although we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements through at least december   including all of our planned research and development activities  we anticipate that we may require significant additional financing in the future to fund our operations and intended research and development activities 
other significant cash and contractual obligations the following summarizes our scheduled long term contractual obligations that will affect our future liquidity as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases license obligations total under the license agreements for our product candidates  we may be required to make future payments based upon the occurrence of certain milestones related to clinical development  regulatory or commercial events 
we will also be required to pay royalties on any net sales of the licensed products  if any are approved by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities for commercial sale 
these milestone payments and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot determine when  or if  the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur at present 

table of contents we also enter into agreements with third parties to conduct our clinical trials  manufacture our product candidates  perform data collection and analysis and other services in connection with our product development programs 
our payment obligations under these agreements depend upon the progress of our product development programs 
therefore  we are unable at this time to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur under these agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to their relatively short term nature 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest income 
our long term investments consist of ars  which are debt instruments with long term maturities in which the interest rates reset in short intervals through dutch auctions by matching buyers and sellers 
our long term asset consists of an ars put 
all of our ars had aaa ratings at the time of purchase and principally represent interests in municipal bonds  government guaranteed student loans  insurance notes and portfolios of securities primarily commercial paper 
none of the underlying collateral for our ars consisted of subprime mortgages or collateralized debt obligations 
at december   million of our ars consisted primarily of municipal bonds and government guaranteed student loan securities and million of our ars consisted of private placement securities 
the negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented most investors  including ourselves  from liquidating certain holdings of ars because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for the securities 
if there is insufficient demand for the securities at the time of the dutch auction  the auction may not be completed and the interest rates may be reset to the maximum interest rate applicable to the specific securities being auctioned as per the official statement issued at the initial bond sale 
when auctions for these securities fail  as they did in  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful or they are redeemed or repurchased  sold through a secondary market or mature 
through december   we successfully liquidated million of ars at par value  which we reinvested in cash equivalents 
in the fourth quarter of  we received and accepted the ars rights offer from ubs 
pursuant to the ars rights offer  we received the ars put 
in january  we were approved by ubs for the ars loan in the amount of million and drew down the entire preapproved amount 
in addition  in february  we borrowed an additional million under the ars loan  bringing the total amount outstanding under the ars loan to million  following ubs decision to increase our availability under the ars loan 
under the ars loan program  ubs may demand full or partial payment of the ars loan  at its sole option and without cause  at any time 
all cash received under the ubs loan was invested in money market accounts 
because the interest that we pay on the ars loan will not exceed the interest that we receive on the ars pledged as security for the ars loan and which are held in the collateral account  we do not believe that this arrangement subjects us to additional interest rate risk
