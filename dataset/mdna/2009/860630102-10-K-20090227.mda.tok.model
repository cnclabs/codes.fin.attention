item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion presented in millions  except where indicated should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive summary through our wholly owned subsidiaries  principally stifel nicolaus  csa  sn ltd  and stifel bank  we are engaged in retail brokerage  securities trading  investment banking  investment advisory  residential  consumer and commercial banking and related financial services throughout the united states and three european offices 
although we have offices across the united states  our major geographic area of concentration is in the midwest and mid atlantic regions with a growing presence in the northeast  southwest and western united states 
our principal customers are individual investors  corporations  municipalities and institutions 
we plan to maintain our focus on revenue growth with a continued focus on developing quality relationships with our clients 
within our private client business  our efforts will be focused on recruiting experienced financial advisors with established client relationships 
within our capital markets business  our focus continues to be on providing quality client management and product diversification 
in executing our growth strategy  we take advantage of the consolidation among middle market firms  which we believe provides us opportunities in our private client and capital markets businesses 
our overall financial results continue to be highly and directly correlated to the direction and activity levels of the united states equity and fixed income markets  our expansion of the equity capital markets and fixed income capital markets segments  the continued expansion of our private client group  and the increased activity from the successful integrations of the following acquisitions lm capital markets business acquired on december   the ryan beck acquisition on february   and the first service acquisition on april  additionally  we expect to successfully complete the integration of our acquisition of butler wick during during  we opened branch offices and hired financial advisors 
in addition  we added   and revenue producers in our equity capital markets  fixed income capital markets  and stifel bank segments  and added employees that directly support these revenue producers and employees for home office support 
for the year ended december   our net revenues increased to a record million compared to million in and represents the thirteenth consecutive year of revenue growth for our company 
net income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the comparability of our operating results were impacted by a significant investment banking transaction in the second quarter of  ryan beck acquisition related expenses of million during  and the inclusion of the full twelve months of operations for ryan beck and stifel bank in  which were acquired on february and april   respectively 
see results of operations total company herein for more details 
our revenue growth was primarily derived from increased commissions  principal transactions  and asset management and services fees  however  certain of our business activities were impacted by the particularly challenging equity market conditions as evidenced by the decline of our investment banking revenues of million from the year ago period 
the market turmoil has contributed to increased commissions and principal transactions revenues for the equity capital markets and fixed income capital markets segments as institutions rebalanced their portfolios to diminish exposure to the markets 
additionally  the market upheaval and the resultant failure of some wall street firms have led to increased market share of institutional business for our company 
the market turmoil has led to a decrease in the value of our customers assets and a decrease in customer margin receivables 
as a result  private client group commissions  asset management and service fees  and margin interest income decreased in the fourth quarter and may diminish in the future 
our business does not produce predictable earnings and is potentially affected by many risk factors such as the global economic and credit slowdown  among others 
see item a  risk factors  of this report for a further discussion of the factors that may affect our future operating results 

table of contents external factors impacting our business our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally  both in the united states and elsewhere around the world 
dramatic declines in the us housing market over the past year  together with increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  which were initially associated with mortgaged backed securities but which have substantially spread to credit default swaps and other derivative securities  in turn have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have ceased to provide funding to even the most credit worthy borrowers 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
the global markets continue to be very volatile 
at december   the key indicators of the markets performances  the dow jones industrial average  the nasdaq  and the s p closed approximately   and  respectively  lower than their december  closing prices 
given such factors  the current year results may not be indicative of future results 
although we do not engage in any significant proprietary trading for our own account  the inventory of securities held to facilitate customer trades and our market making activities are sensitive to market movements 
we do not have any significant direct exposure to the sub prime market crisis  but are subject to market fluctuations resulting from news and corporate events in the sub prime mortgage markets  associated write downs by other financial services firms and interest rate fluctuations 
stock prices for companies in this industry  including stifel financial corp  have been volatile as a result of reactions to the global credit crisis and the continued volatility in the financial services industry 
we will continue to monitor our market capitalization and review for potential goodwill asset impairment losses if events or changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
in connection with ars  our broker dealer subsidiaries have been subject to ongoing investigations  which include inquiries from the sec  finra and several state regulatory agencies  with which we are cooperating fully 
we are also named in a class action lawsuit similar to that filed against a number of brokerage firms alleging various securities law violations  which we are vigorously defending 
as of february   our clients held approximately million of ars 
we are  in conjunction with other industry participants actively seeking a solution to ars illiquidity 
see item  legal proceedings  in this report for further details regarding ars investigations and claims 
in addition to the ars held by our clients  we held million of ars at december  in our inventory of trading securities  which were classified as level iii financial instrument 
additionally  we held a million par value asset backed security  consisting of collateralized debt obligation trust preferred securities related primarily to banks  which is carried at million in our held to maturity portfolio 
this investment was also classified as a level iii financial instrument at december  see the section entitled liquidity and capital resources herein regarding the valuation of our financial instruments

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the warrants 
analysis of financial condition our company s statement of financial condition consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  trading inventory  bank loans  investments  goodwill  loans and advances to financial advisors and payables 
total assets of billion at december  were up approximately over december  most of this increase is due to the growth of stifel bank  with the increased loan balances being funded by increased deposits 
stifel bank loan balances increased significantly as we took advantage of originating quality loans at attractive prices resulting from a desire for liquidity in the markets in response to the credit crisis 
significant decreases in assets were in customer receivables and receivables from broker and dealers 
the broker dealer gross assets and liabilities  including trading inventory  stock loan borrow  receivables and payables from to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations and clients  fluctuate with our business levels and overall market conditions 
as of december   our liabilities were comprised primarily of deposits of million at stifel bank and brokerage client payables of million at our broker dealer subsidiaries  as well as accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
to meet our obligations to clients and operating needs  we have approximately million in cash 
we also have client brokerage receivables of million and million in loans at stifel bank 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is essential to our business 
we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including our cash and net capital positions  and we have implemented a liquidity strategy designed to enable our business to continue to operate even under adverse circumstances  although there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful under all circumstances 
our assets  consisting mainly of cash or assets readily convertible into cash  are our principle source of liquidity 
the liquid nature of these assets provides for flexibility in managing and financing the projected operating needs of the business 
these assets are financed primarily by our equity capital  debentures to trusts  client credit balances  short term bank loans  proceeds from securities lending  and other payables 
we currently finance our client accounts and firm trading positions through ordinary course borrowings at floating interest rates from various banks on a demand basis and securities lending  with company owned and client securities pledged as collateral 
changes in securities market volumes  related client borrowing demands  underwriting activity  and levels of securities inventory affect the amount of our financing requirements 

table of contents our bank assets consist principally of retained loans  available for sale securities  and cash and cash equivalents 
stifel bank s current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from bank clients and equity capital 
we monitor the liquidity of stifel bank daily to ensure its ability to meet customer deposit withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements and support asset growth 
we rely exclusively on financing activities and distributions from our subsidiaries for funds to implement our business and growth strategies  and repurchase shares of our common stock 
net capital rules  restrictions under our long term debt  or the borrowing arrangements of our subsidiaries  as well as the earnings  financial condition  and cash requirements of our subsidiaries  may each limit distributions to us from our subsidiaries 
we have an ongoing authorization  as amended  from the board of directors to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions 
in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares  for a total authorization to repurchase up to  shares as adjusted for the three for two stock split in june 
the share repurchase program will manage our equity capital relative to the growth of our business and help to meet obligations under our employee benefit plans 
during  we repurchased  of our shares of common stock under this authorization at an average price of 
we currently do not pay cash dividends on our common stock 
we believe our existing assets  most of which are liquid in nature  together with the funds from operations  available informal short term credit arrangements  long term borrowings  and our ability to raise additional capital will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and anticipated financing needs 
cash flow cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from million at december  operating activities provided cash of million due to cash received from earnings  a reduction in operating assets and the net effect of non cash expenses 
investing activities used million of cash for bank customer loan originations  and fixed asset purchases  offset by net proceeds from the sale of our available for sale securities and proprietary investments and bank customer loan repayments 
during  we purchased million in fixed assets  consisting primarily of information technology equipment  leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
financing activities used million of cash due to an increase in securities loaned  net  pay down of our short term borrowings and purchases of our common stock  offset by an increase in bank deposits due to the growth of the bank and proceeds from the public offering of  shares of our common stock during the third quarter of funding sources our short term financing is generally obtained through the use of bank loans and securities lending arrangements 
we borrow from various banks on a demand basis with company owned and customer securities pledged as collateral 
the value of the customer owned securities is not reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
available ongoing credit arrangements with banks totaled million at december   all of which was unused 
there are no compensating balance requirements under these arrangements 
at december   there were no short term borrowings from banks 
at december   short term borrowings from banks were million at an average rate of  which were collateralized by company owned securities valued at million 
the average bank borrowing was million  million  and million in   and  respectively  at weighted average daily interest rates of   and  respectively 
at december  and december   stifel nicolaus had a stock loan balance of million and million  respectively  at weighted average daily interest rates of and  respectively 
the average outstanding securities lending arrangements utilized in financing activities were million  million  and million during   and  respectively  at weighted average daily effective interest rates of   and  respectively 
customer owned securities were utilized in these arrangements 
the impact of the tightened credit markets has resulted in decreased financing through stock loan as our counterparties sought liquidity 
as a result  bank loan financing used to finance trading inventories increased at lower interest rates charged by banks 

table of contents stifel bank has net borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank of million at december  and an million federal funds agreement for the purpose of purchasing short term funds should additional liquidity be needed 
stifel bank receives overnight funds from excess cash held in stifel nicolaus brokerage accounts  which are deposited into a money market account 
these balances totaled million at december  our liquidity requirements may change in the event we need to raise more funds than anticipated to increase inventory positions  support more rapid expansion  develop new or enhanced services and products  acquire technologies  or respond to other unanticipated liquidity requirements 
we rely exclusively on financing activities and distributions from our subsidiaries for funds to implement our business and growth strategies  and repurchase our shares 
net capital rules  restrictions under our long term debt  or the borrowing arrangements of our subsidiaries  as well as the earnings  financial condition  and cash requirements of our subsidiaries  may each limit distributions to us from our subsidiaries 
in the event existing internal and external financial resources do not satisfy our needs  we may have to seek additional outside financing 
the availability of outside financing will depend on a variety of factors  such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the volume of trading activities  the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry  credit ratings  and credit capacity  as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of our long term or short term financial prospects if we incurred large trading losses or if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn or otherwise 
we currently do not have a credit rating  which could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position by increasing our borrowing costs and limiting access to sources of liquidity that require a credit rating as a condition to providing funds 
capital resources in connection with ars  our broker dealer subsidiaries have been subject to ongoing investigations  which include inquiries from the sec  finra and several state regulatory agencies  with which we are cooperating fully 
we are also named in a class action lawsuit similar to that filed against a number of brokerage firms alleging various securities law violations  which we are vigorously defending 
as of february   our clients held approximately million of ars 
we are  in conjunction with other industry participants actively seeking a solution to ars illiquidity 
if we were to redeem these securities from certain of our clients in order to resolve pending claims  inquiries  or investigations  it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows  and we would be required to assess whether we had sufficient regulatory capital or borrowing capacity to do so 
see item  legal proceedings of this report for a discussion of our legal matters including ars 
we have contingent earn out consideration related to our acquisition of the lm capital markets business from citigroup inc on december  the contingent earn out payment to citigroup inc is based on the performance of the combined capital markets business of both our pre closing fixed income and equity capital markets business and lm capital markets over the three year period beginning january   up to a maximum million of additional purchase consideration 
for calendar years   and  our company recorded an earn out liability of million  million  and million  respectively  which was accounted for as additional purchase price 
any payment to citigroup inc for these contingent earn out payments would be payable in early 
table of contents on february   we closed on the acquisition of ryan beck from bankatlantic bancorp  inc a contingent earn out payment is payable based on defined revenues attributable to specified individuals in ryan beck s existing private client division over the two year period following closing 
this earn out is capped at million 
a second contingent payment is payable based on defined revenues attributable to specified individuals in ryan beck s existing investment banking division 
the investment banking earn out is equal to of the amount of investment banking fees over million for each successive year in the two year period following closing 
we paid the first year investment banking contingent earn out payment of million in  shares of our common stock in may based upon the provisions of the agreements for the contingent earn outs  an earn out payment will not be due for the second year investment banking contingent earn out  but we estimate that million could be payable under the private client division contingent earn out payment arrangement 
on august   we agreed to prepay million of bankatlantic s pro rata share of the estimated private client division contingent earn out payment in exchange for a million permanent reduction of bankatlantic s pro rata share of the private client contingent payment 
we elected to make such pre payment using  shares of our common stock at an agreed upon per share price of 
in the event that bankatlantic s pro rata portion of the private client contingent payment is less than million  bankatlantic has agreed to reimburse the shortfall 
we have recorded a liability for the remaining estimated contingent earn out of million at december  the contingent payment is reflected as additional purchase consideration and reflected in goodwill 
we have the ability to pay any future contingent consideration in cash or stock at our election 
net capital requirements we operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to net capital requirements  which may limit distributions to our company from our broker dealer subsidiaries 
as previously discussed in item regulations in this report  distributions from our broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to net capital rules 
these subsidiaries have historically operated in excess of minimum net capital requirements 
however  if distributions were to be limited in the future due to the subsidiaries failure to comply with the net capital rules or a change in the net capital rules  it could have a material and adverse affect to our company by limiting our operations that require intensive use of capital  such as underwriting or trading activities  or limit our ability to implement our business and growth strategies  pay interest on and repay the principal of our debt  and or repurchase our common stock 
our non broker dealer subsidiary  stifel bank is also subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
at december   stifel nicolaus had net capital of million  which was of its aggregate debit items  and million in excess of its minimum required net capital  csa had net capital of million  which was million in excess of its minimum required net capital  butler wick had net capital of million which was million in excess of its minimum required net capital 
at december   sn ltd had capital and reserves of million  which was million in excess of the financial resources requirement under the rules of the fsa 
at december   stifel bank was considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action

critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules that require us to make assumptions  judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
for a full description of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents valuation of financial instruments trading securities owned and pledged  available for sale securities  certain other investments  and trading securities sold  but not yet purchased  on our consolidated statements of financial condition are recorded at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations 
we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas during the first quarter of sfas defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
during the fourth quarter of  both the financial accounting standards board fasb and the staff of the sec re emphasized the importance of sound fair value measurement in financial reporting 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp fas  determining fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
this statement clarifies that determining fair value in an inactive market or dislocated market depends on facts and circumstances and requires significant judgment 
this statement specifies that it is acceptable to use inputs based on management estimates or assumptions  or for management to make adjustments to observable inputs to determine fair value when markets are not active and relevant observable inputs are not available 
our fair value measurement policies are consistent with the guidance in fsp fas sfas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  or an exit price 
the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment used in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less pricing observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models that require more judgment 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established  the characteristics specific to the transaction  and overall market conditions generally 
when available  we use observable market prices  observable market parameters  or broker or dealer prices bid and ask prices to derive the fair value of financial instruments 
in the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges  the observable market prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of our trading securities and other investments owned  trading securities pledged as collateral  and trading securities sold  but not yet purchased  are based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or derived from broker or dealer prices 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product 
where available  observable market prices and pricing or market parameters in a product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques involve some degree of judgment 
for investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using the best information available 
among the factors we consider in determining the fair value of investments are the cost of the investment  terms and liquidity  developments since the acquisition of the investment  the sales price of recently issued securities  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows  the long term business potential of the issuer  the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yield that are publicly traded  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
in instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions  the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of a similar security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions 
the fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term and the differences could be material 

table of contents we utilize an outside valuation firm to assist in the valuation of our asset backed securities held in our available for sale portfolio 
the outside valuation firm utilizes comprehensive models to price the securities in a way that is consistent with the values that the market has for other debt securities on a relative or spread connected basis 
the models may include the following methodologies  as appropriate  for each individual security determine market value of each asset in portfolio  calculate default rates for each asset individually  create correlation structure for portfolio  simulate portfolio future monte carlo numerous times  run samples through waterfall  diagram net present value of cash flows to tranches in different scenarios  and determine the value of the tranches 
we validate the inputs and other information utilized  where possible  in valuations provided by third parties 
we have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into a three level classification in accordance with sfas fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are generally categorized as level i  and fair value measurements of financial instruments that have no direct observable levels are generally categorized as level iii  all other fair value measurements of financial instruments that do not fall within the level i or level iii classification are considered level ii 
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of a financial instrument is used to categorize the instrument and reflects the judgment of management 
financial assets and liabilities presented as fair value in our consolidated statements of financial condition generally are categorized as follows level i quoted prices unadjusted are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date 
a quoted price for an identical asset or liability in an active market provides the most reliable fair value measurement because it is directly observable to the market 
the type of financial instruments included in level i are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices such as equities listed in active markets and certain us treasury bonds and other government obligations 
level ii pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date 
the nature of these financial instruments include instruments for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently  derivative instruments whose fair value have been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market  or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments  the parameters of which can be directly observed 
instruments which are generally included in this category are equity securities not actively traded  corporate obligations infrequently traded  certain government and municipal obligations  certain bank notes  interest rate swaps  certain asset backed securities consisting of collateral loan obligation securities  and certain mortgage backed securities 
level iii instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the measurement date 
these financial instruments do not have two way markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value  where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation 
instruments included in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs  certain corporate obligations with unobservable pricing inputs  auction rate securities  certain airplane trust certificates  limited partnerships  and other company investments 
our investments in auction rate securities are backed by state municipal student loan bonds and closed end mutual fund owned corporate stocks and bonds 
these auction rate securities have been deemed to be illiquid  and  as a result  have been valued using unobservable inputs 
at december   level iii assets for which we bear economic exposure were million  or of the total assets measured at fair value 
during  we recorded net sales of million of level iii assets 
our valuation adjustments realized and unrealized reduced the value of our level iii assets by million 
additionally  there were million of net transfers into the level iii category during the increase in net transfers is primarily attributable to reduced price transparency on some of our preferred and municipal auction rate securities 

table of contents at december   level iii assets included the following million of auction rate securities  of which the auctions have failed  million of asset backed securities  and million of private equity and other fixed income securities 
contingencies we are involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings related to our business  including litigation  arbitration and regulatory proceedings 
some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts  including claims for punitive damages 
we have  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas to the extent that claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
this determination is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are subject to potentially significant revision as more information becomes available and due to subsequent events 
in making these determinations  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant  the basis and validity of the claim  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for  and magnitude of  damages or settlements from such pending and potential litigation and arbitration proceedings  and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies 
see item  legal proceedings  in part i of this report for information on our legal  regulatory and arbitration proceedings 
allowance for doubtful receivables from former employees we offer transition pay  principally in the form of upfront loans  to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers as part of our overall growth strategy 
these loans are generally forgiven over a five to ten year period if the individual satisfies certain conditions  usually based on continued employment and certain performance standards 
if the individual leaves before the term of the loan expires or fails to meet certain performance standards  the individual is required to repay the balance 
in determining the allowance for doubtful receivables from former employees  we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding each receivable  including the amount of the unforgiven balance  the reasons for the terminated employment relationship  and the former employees overall financial position 
the loan balance from former employees at december  and was million and million  respectively  with associated loss allowances of million and million  respectively 
allowance for loan losses we regularly review the loan portfolio of stifel bank and have established an allowance for loan losses in accordance with sfas the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to income 
in providing for the allowance for loan losses  we consider historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements 
in addition  impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans and a specific allowance established for individual loans determined to be impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
impairment is measured using the present value of the impaired loan s expected cash flow discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 

table of contents a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collectible 
factors considered in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
we determine the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  usually when principal or interest becomes days past due or when collection becomes uncertain  the accrual of interest and amortization of deferred loan origination fees is discontinued non accrual status  and any accrued and unpaid interest income is written off 
loans placed on non accrual status are returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest payments are collected and the collectibility of future principal and interest payments is reasonably assured 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
income taxes the provision for income taxes and related tax reserves is based on our consideration of known liabilities and tax contingencies for multiple taxing authorities 
known liabilities are amounts that will appear on current tax returns  amounts that have been agreed to in revenue agent revisions as the result of examinations by the taxing authorities and amounts that will follow from such examinations but affect years other than those being examined 
tax contingencies are liabilities that might arise from a successful challenge by the taxing authorities taking a contrary position or interpretation regarding the application of tax law to our tax return filings 
factors considered in estimating our liability are results of tax audits  historical experience  and consultation with tax attorneys and other experts 
fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas statement no 
 clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
and prescribed recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provided guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition

determining the fair value of assets and liabilities requires certain estimates 
at december   we had goodwill of million and intangible assets of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 
rather  they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment 
this test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities  identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  a further test is required to measure the amount of the impairment 
we have elected to test for goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each calendar year 
the results of the impairment test performed during the third quarter did not indicate any impairment 

table of contents the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  economic trends and market conditions  changes in revenue growth trends or business strategies  unanticipated competition  discount rates  technology  or government regulations 
in assessing the fair value of our reporting units  the volatile nature of the securities markets and industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows 
in addition to discounted cash flows  we consider other information such as public market comparables and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results

dilution as of december   there were  shares of our common stock issuable on outstanding options  with an average weighted exercise price of  and  outstanding stock unit grants  with each unit representing the right to receive shares of our common stock at a designated time in the future 
the restricted stock units vest on an annual basis over the next three to eight years  and are distributable  if vested  at future specified dates 
of the outstanding restricted stock unit awards   shares are currently vested and  are unvested 
assuming vesting requirements are met  the company anticipates that  shares under these awards will be distributed in   will be distributed in   will be distributed in  and the balance of  will be distributed thereafter 
an employee will realize income as a result of an award of stock units at the time shares are distributed in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares at that time  and we are entitled to a corresponding tax deduction in the year of such issuance 
unless an employee elects to satisfy such withholding in another manner  such as by paying the amount in cash or by delivering shares of stifel financial corp 
common stock already owned by such person and held by such person for at least six months  we may satisfy tax withholding obligations on income associated with such grants by reducing the number of shares otherwise deliverable in connection with such awards  such reduction to be calculated based on a current market price of our common stock 
based on current tax law  we anticipate that the shares issued when the awards are paid to the employees will be reduced by approximately to satisfy such withholding obligations  so that approximately of the total restricted stock units that are distributable in any particular year will be converted into issued and outstanding shares

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management risks are an inherent part of our business and activities 
management of these risks is critical to our soundness and profitability 
risk management at our company is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment  and knowledge of financial products and markets 
our senior management group takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment  monitoring  and control of various risks 
the principal risks involved in our business activities are market interest rates and equity prices  credit  operational  and regulatory and legal 
market risk the potential for changes in the value of financial instruments owned by our company resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices is referred to as market risk 
market risk is inherent to financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of our market risk management procedures includes all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
we trade tax exempt and taxable debt obligations  including us treasury bills  notes  and bonds  us government agency and municipal notes and bonds  bank certificates of deposit  mortgage backed securities  and corporate obligations 
we are also an active market maker in over the counter equity securities 
in connection with these activities  we may maintain inventories in order to ensure availability and to facilitate customer transactions 
changes in value of our financial instruments may result from fluctuations in interest rates  credit ratings  equity prices  and the correlation among these factors  along with the level of volatility 
we manage our trading businesses by product and have established trading departments that have responsibility for each product 
the trading inventories are managed with a view toward facilitating client transactions  considering the risk and profitability of each inventory position 
position limits in trading inventory accounts are established and monitored on a daily basis 
we monitor inventory levels and results of the trading departments  as well as inventory aging  pricing  concentration  and securities ratings 
the following table primarily represents trading inventory associated with our customer facilitation and market making activities and includes net long and short fair values  which is consistent with the way risk exposure is managed 
december  december  in thousands owned sold  but not yet purchased owned sold  but not yet purchased securities  at fair value us government obligations state and municipal bonds corporate obligations corporate stocks we are also exposed to market risk based on our other investing activities 
these investments consist of investments in private equity partnerships  start up companies  venture capital investments and zero coupon us government securities and are included under the caption investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
interest rate risk 
table of contents we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining inventories of interest rate sensitive financial instruments and from changes in the interest rates on our interest earning assets including client loans  stock borrow activities  investments  and inventories and our funding sources including client cash balances  stock lending activities  bank borrowings  and resale agreements  which finance these assets 
the collateral underlying financial instruments at the broker dealer is repriced daily  thus requiring collateral to be delivered as necessary 
interest rates on client balances and stock borrow and lending produce a positive spread to our company  with the rates generally fluctuating in parallel 
we manage our inventory exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and  where feasible  hedging with offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics 
while a significant portion of our securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years  these inventories  on average  turn over several times per year 
additionally  we monitor  on a daily basis  the value at risk var in our institutional fixed income capital markets trading portfolios using daily market data for the previous twelve months and report var at a confidence level 
var is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical price trends and volatility 
this model assumes that historical changes in market conditions are representative of future changes  and trading losses on any given day could exceed the reported var by significant amounts in unusual volatile markets 
further  the model involves a number of assumptions and inputs 
while we believe that the assumptions and inputs we use in our risk model are reasonable  different assumptions and inputs could produce materially different var estimates 
the following table sets forth the high  low  and daily average var for our institutional fixed income capital markets trading portfolios during the twelve months ended december  and the daily var at december  and twelve months ended december  var calculation at s in thousands high low daily average december  december  daily var related portfolio value var as a percent of portfolio value stifel bank s interest rate risk is principally associated with changes in market interest rates related to residential  consumer  and commercial lending activities  as well as fdic insured deposit accounts to customers of our broker dealer subsidiaries and to the general public 
our primary emphasis in interest rate risk management for stifel bank is the matching of assets and liabilities of similar cash flow and re pricing time frames 
this matching of assets and liabilities reduces exposure to interest rate movements and aids in stabilizing positive interest spreads 
stifel bank has established limits for acceptable interest rate risk and acceptable portfolio value risk 
to ensure that stifel bank is within the limits established for net interest margin  an analysis of net interest margin based on various shifts in interest rates is prepared each quarter and presented to stifel bank s board of directors for the three month period ending the month before the end of our fiscal quarter 
stifel bank utilizes a third party vendor to analyze the available data 
the following table illustrates the estimated change in net interest margin at november  based on shifts in interest rates of positive basis points and negative basis points

we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions constantly throughout each day 
our equity securities inventories are repriced on a regular basis  and there are no unrecorded gains or losses 
our activities as a dealer are client driven  with the objective of meeting clients needs while earning a positive spread 
credit risk we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities  with the counterparties primarily being broker dealers 
in the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  we may be exposed to risk 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument 
we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring position limits for each counterparty  monitoring trading counterparties  conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties  reviewing security concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions  and conducting business through clearing organizations  which guarantee performance 
our client activities involve the execution  settlement  and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients 
client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis 
credit exposure associated with our private client business consists primarily of customer margin accounts  which are monitored daily and are collateralized 
we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analyses on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities 
we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
we have accepted collateral in connection with resale agreements  securities borrowed transactions  and customer margin loans 
under many agreements  we are permitted to sell or repledge these securities held as collateral and use these securities to enter into securities lending arrangements or to deliver to counterparties to cover short positions 
at december   the fair value of securities accepted as collateral where we are permitted to sell or repledge the securities was million  and the fair value of the collateral that had been sold or repledged was million 

table of contents stifel bank extends credit to individual and commercial borrowers through a variety of loan products  including residential and commercial mortgage loans  home equity loans  construction loans and non real estate commercial and consumer loans 
bank loans are generally collateralized by real estate  real property  or other assets of the borrower 
stifel bank s loan policy includes criteria to adequately underwrite  document  monitor  and manage credit risk 
underwriting requires reviewing and documenting the fundamental characteristics of credit including character  capacity to service the debt  capital  conditions  and collateral 
benchmark capital and coverage ratios are utilized which include liquidity  debt service coverage  credit  working capital  and capital to asset ratios 
lending limits are established to include individual  collective  committee  and board authority 
monitoring credit risk is accomplished through defined loan review procedures including frequency and scope 
we are subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions  extend large loans to  or have large commitments with a single counterparty  borrower  or group of similar counterparties or borrowers ie  in the same industry 
securities purchased under agreements to resell consist of securities issued by the us government or its agencies 
receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are both with a large number of clients and counterparties  and any potential concentration is carefully monitored 
stock borrow and lending activities are executed under master netting agreements  which gives our company right of offset in the event of counterparty default 
inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made  including underwritings  may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses 
we seek to limit this risk through careful review of counterparties and borrowers and the use of limits established by our senior management group  taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counterparty  the size of the position or commitment  the expected duration of the position or commitment  and other positions or commitments outstanding 
operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems  and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes 
we operate different businesses in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process a large number of transactions 
these risks are less direct than credit and market risk  but managing them is critical  particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees  we could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions  and damage to our reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  we have developed and continue to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as accounting  operations  information technology  legal  compliance  and internal audit 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
business continuity plans exist for critical systems  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
regulatory and legal risk legal risk includes the risk of large numbers of private client group customer claims for sales practice violations 
while these claims may not be the result of any wrongdoing  we do  at a minimum  incur costs associated with investigating and defending against such claims 
see further discussion on our legal reserves policy under critical accounting policies and estimates in item and legal proceedings in item of this report 
in addition  we are subject to potentially sizable adverse legal judgments or arbitration awards  and fines  penalties  and other sanctions for non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
we are generally subject to extensive regulation by the sec  finra  and state securities regulators in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
we have comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  the extension of credit  including margin loans  collection activities  money laundering  and record keeping 
we act as an underwriter or selling group member in both equity and fixed income product offerings 
particularly when acting as lead or co lead manager  we have potential legal exposure to claims relating to these securities offerings 
to manage this exposure  a committee of senior executives review proposed underwriting commitments to assess the quality of the offering and the adequacy of due diligence investigation 

table of contents effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  securities inventory  and receivables from customers and brokers and dealers 
these monetary assets are generally liquid and turn over rapidly  and consequently  are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects various expenses of our company  such as employee compensation and benefits  communications and office supplies  and occupancy and equipment rental  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services we offer to our clients 
further  to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations
