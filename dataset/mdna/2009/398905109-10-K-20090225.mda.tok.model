item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part i  including the matters set forth in the risk factors section  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading operator in the trillion automotive retail industry 
as of december   we owned and operated franchises at dealership locations and collision service centers in the united states and six franchises at three dealerships and two collision centers in the uk we market and sell an extensive range of automotive products and services including new and used vehicles and related financing  vehicle maintenance and repair services  replacement parts  and warranty  insurance and extended service contracts 
our operations are primarily located in major metropolitan areas in alabama  california  florida  georgia  kansas  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  oklahoma  south carolina and texas in the united states of america and in the towns of brighton  hailsham and worthing in the uk as of december   our retail network consisted of the following three regions with the number of dealerships they comprised i the eastern dealerships in alabama  florida  georgia  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey  new york and south carolina  ii the central dealerships in kansas  oklahoma and texas  and iii the western dealerships in california 
each region is managed by a regional vice president reporting directly to the chief executive officer and a regional chief financial officer reporting directly to our chief financial officer 
in addition  our international operations consist of three dealerships in the uk also managed locally with direct reporting responsibilities to our corporate management team 
during  as throughout our year history  we grew our business primarily through acquisitions 
we typically seek to acquire large  profitable  well established and well managed dealerships that are leaders in their respective market areas 
from january   through december   we have acquired dealership franchises with annual revenues of billion  disposed of or terminated dealership franchises with annual revenues of billion  and been granted three new dealership franchises by our manufacturers 
in alone  we acquired luxury and domestic franchises with expected annual revenues of million 
each acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and the corresponding results of operations of these dealerships are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in the following discussion and analysis  we report certain performance measures of our newly acquired dealerships separately from those of our existing dealerships 
our operating results reflect the combined performance of each of our interrelated business activities  which include the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and parts  service and collision repair services 
historically  each of these activities has been directly or indirectly impacted by a variety of supply demand factors  including vehicle inventories  consumer confidence  discretionary spending  availability and affordability of consumer credit  manufacturer incentives  weather patterns  fuel prices and interest rates 
for example  during periods of sustained economic downturn or significant supply demand imbalances  new vehicle sales may be negatively impacted as consumers tend to shift their purchases to used vehicles 
some consumers may even delay their purchasing decisions altogether  electing instead to repair their existing vehicles 
in such cases  however  we believe the new vehicle sales impact on our overall business is mitigated by our ability to offer other products and services  such as used vehicles and parts  service and collision repair services 
we generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
this seasonality is generally attributable to consumer buying trends and the timing of manufacturer new vehicle model introductions 
in addition  in some regions of the united states  vehicle purchases decline during the winter months 
as a result  our revenues  cash flows and operating income are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters 
other factors unrelated to seasonality  such as changes in economic condition and manufacturer incentive programs  may exaggerate seasonal or cause counter seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating income 
during  the us and global economies suffered from  among other things  a substantial decline in consumer confidence and a tightening of credit availability 
as a result  our automotive retail industry was negatively impacted by decreasing customer demand for new and used vehicles  vehicle margin pressures and 
table of contents higher inventory levels 
in addition  the economic downturn has adversely impacted the manufacturers that supply our new vehicle inventory and some of our parts inventory  particularly the three domestic manufacturers 
in response to this economic crisis  we have taken several key steps to appropriately size our business and allow us to manage through this industry downturn  including wage cuts for our senior management team and board of directors  as well as various other levels  alterations to pay plans  headcount reductions and the elimination or minimization of several other variable expenses to align with current and projected operational results 
for the year ended december   we realized a net loss of million  or per diluted share  and for the years ended december  and  we realized net income of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
the following factors impacted our financial condition and results of operations in  and year ended december  asset impairments in the third quarter of  we determined that the economic conditions and resulting impact on the automotive retail industry  as well as the uncertainty surrounding the going concern of the domestic automobile manufacturers  indicated the potential for an impairment of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in response to the identification of such triggering events  we performed an interim impairment assessment of our recorded values of goodwill and intangible franchise rights 
as a result of such assessment  we determined that the fair values of certain indefinite lived intangible franchise rights were less than their respective carrying values and recorded a pretax charge of million  primarily related to our domestic brand franchises 
further  during the third quarter of  we identified potential impairment indicators relative to certain of our real estate holdings  primarily associated with domestic franchise terminations  and other equipment  after giving consideration to the likelihood that certain facilities would not be sold or used by a prospective buyer as an automobile dealership operation given market conditions 
as a result  we performed an impairment assessment of these long lived assets and determined that the respective carrying values exceeded their estimated fair market values  as determined by third party appraisals and brokers opinions of value 
accordingly  we recognized an million pretax asset impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual assessment of impairments relative to our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  utilizing our valuation model  which consists of a blend between the market and income approaches 
as a result  we identified additional impairments of our recorded value of intangible franchise rights  primarily attributable to the continued weakening of the united states economy  higher market risk premiums  the negative impact of the economic recession on the automotive retail industry and the growing uncertainty surrounding the three domestic automobile manufacturers  all of which worsened between the third and fourth quarter assessments 
specifically  with regards to the valuation assumptions utilized in our income approach  we increased our weighted average cost of capital or wacc from the wacc utilized in our impairment assessment during the third quarter of and historical levels 
in addition  because of the negative selling trends experienced in the fourth quarter of  we revised our industry sales outlook  or seasonally adjusted annual rate or saar  from our previous forecast 
further  with regards to the assumptions within our market approach  we utilized historical market multiples of guideline companies for both revenue and pretax net income 
these multiples and the resulting fair value estimates were adversely impacted by the declines in stock values during much of  including the fourth quarter 
as a result  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  predominantly related to franchises in our western region 
gain on debt redemption in  we redeemed million of our senior subordinated notes due the notes and  as a result  recognized a million pretax gain 
in addition  we redeemed million of our convertible senior notes the notes and  as a result  recognized a million pretax gain and a proportionate reduction in deferred tax assets relative to unamortized costs of the purchased options acquired that were deductible for tax purposes as an original issue discount 

table of contents lease terminations our results for the twelve months ended december  were negatively impacted by a million pretax charge  related to the termination of a dealership facility lease in conjunction with the relocation of several of our dealership franchises from one to multiple facilities 
discontinued operations during the twelve months ended december  we disposed of certain operations that qualified for discontinued operations accounting treatment 
the necessary reclassifications have been made to our consolidated statement of operations for twelve months ended december   as well as our consolidated statement of cash flows for the twelve months ended december   to reflect these operations as discontinued 
in addition  we have made reclassifications to the consolidated balance sheet as of december   which was derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  form k  to properly reflect the discontinued operations 
year ended december  asset impairments in conjunction with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights associated with six of our dealerships to be impaired 
accordingly  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of further  in conjunction with the sale of real estate associated with one of our dealerships  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge 
in addition  we recognized a total of million in additional pretax impairment charges related to the impairment of fixed assets  primarily associated with sold stores and terminated franchises 
lease terminations during the first half of  our results were negatively impacted by million of pretax charges as we terminated real estate leases associated with the sale or termination of two of our domestic brand franchises 
in addition  during  we successfully completed the conversion of all of our stores to operate on the dealer services group of automatic data processing inc adp platform for dealership management services 
as a result  we recognized an additional million in lease termination costs related to these conversions 
loss on bond redemption during the third quarter  we recognized a million pretax charge on the redemption of million of our notes 
year ended december  asset impairments in conjunction with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights associated with two of our domestic franchises to be impaired 
accordingly  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell one of our ford dealership franchises and  as a result  identified the carrying value of certain fixed assets associated with the dealership to be impaired 
in connection therewith  we recorded a pretax impairment charge of million 
hurricanes katrina and rita insurance settlements and new orleans recovery we settled all building  content and vehicle damage and business interruption insurance claims with our insurance carriers in as a result  we recognized an additional million of business interruption proceeds related to covered payroll and fixed cost expenditures incurred during  as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
lease terminations on march   we announced that adp would become the sole dealership management system provider for our existing stores 
we converted a number of our stores from other systems to adp in and settled the lease termination agreement with one of our other system providers for all stores converted as of december  in june  as a result of the significant damage sustained at our dodge store on the east bank of new orleans during hurricane katrina  we terminated our franchise with daimlerchrylser  dealership operations 
table of contents at this store and the associated facilities lease agreement 
as a result of the lease termination  we recognized a million pretax charge 
dealership disposals we disposed of franchises during  resulting in an aggregate pretax gain on sale of million 
severance costs in conjunction with our management realignment from platform to regional structures  we entered into severance agreements with several employees 
in aggregate  these severance costs amounted to million in these items  and other variances between the periods presented  are covered in the following discussion

the following discussion briefly highlights certain of the results and trends occurring within our business 
throughout the following discussion  references are made to same store results and variances  which are discussed in more detail in the results of operations section that follows 
during  the retail automotive industry suffered from dramatic shifts in customer vehicle preferences primarily associated with fuel economy  declining consumer confidence  reduced credit availability and weakening economic conditions 
our new vehicle retail sales and gross margins for  particularly in our truck heavy brands and our truck dependent markets  were adversely impacted by a shift in consumer demand towards more fuel efficient vehicles during the second and third quarters of  following a spike in gasoline prices 
later in the year  customer preferences trended away from fuel efficient vehicles  following the decline in gasoline prices  and negatively affected our new vehicle sales and margins 
further  the economic uncertainty substantially slowed our new vehicle retail sales in and  in turn  pressured our new vehicle margins 
our used vehicle results are directly affected by economic conditions  the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
declining new vehicle markets and manufacturer efforts to stimulate new vehicle sales through incentives created margin pressure in our used vehicle business and contributed to a weaker used vehicle market in as compared to and further  similar to the new vehicle business  our used vehicle sales and margins were negatively impacted by the two shifts in customer vehicle preferences during  as well as  tighter credit standards particularly reductions in 
table of contents loan to value amounts 
our consolidated parts and service gross margin also felt the impact of more rapid growth in our relatively lower margin collision business and the negative impact of declining new and used vehicle sales  with margins declining basis points in however  our consolidated finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold increased in compared to and  primarily reflecting improvements in our pricing structure 
our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased in absolute dollars by in compared to but  as a percentage of gross profit  sg a increased basis points to in  as a result of the decline in gross profit 
our operating margin for was also negatively impacted by a million charge for asset impairments  primarily attributable to identified shortfalls in the fair value of certain long lived asset and intangible franchise rights when compared to the respective capitalized value 
as a result  operating margin decreased basis points from in to in our pretax margin declined from in to in in addition to the factors noted above  the pretax margin was negatively impacted by an increase in other interest expense  primarily attributable to interest incurred on real estate related borrowings  but partially offset by gains recognized on the redemption of our notes and convertible notes 
we believe that our continued growth depends on  among other things  our ability to achieve optimum performance from our diverse franchise mix  attract and retain high caliber employees and reinvest as needed to maintain top quality facilities  while at the same time successfully acquiring and integrating new dealerships 
during  we plan to continue our transition to an operating model with greater commonality of key operating processes and systems that support the extension of best practices and the leveraging of scale 
in addition  we expect to spend less than million to construct new facilities and upgrade or expand existing facilities 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  for all of its financial assets and liabilities 
the statement does not require new fair value measurements  but emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability and provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy for classification of financial assets or liabilities based upon measurement inputs 
sfas applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
see note for the application of sfas and further details regarding fair value measurement our financial assets and liabilities as of december  in november  the fasb deferred for one year the implementation of sfas no 
for non financial assets and liabilities 
in february the fasb issued fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 sfas  which defers the effective date of sfas  as it related to non financial assets and non financial liabilities  to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have evaluated our financial statements and has determined the adoption of this pronouncement upon its existing nonfinancial assets  such as goodwill and intangible assets  will not materially impact us as we already utilize an income approach in measuring the fair value of our nonfinancial assets as prescribed by sfas upon adoption we anticipate enhancing our current disclosures surrounding our nonfinancial assets and liabilities to meet the requirements of sfas similarly to those already provided for in our financial assets and liabilities in note we determined we currently do not hold any non financial liabilities for which this pronouncement is applicable 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards  which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas  a company may elect to use a fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees and issued debt 
we adopted sfas effective january   and elected not to measure any of our currently eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which significantly changes the accounting for business acquisitions both during the period of the acquisition and in subsequent periods 
the more significant changes in the accounting for acquisitions which could impact us are certain transactions cost  which are presently treated as cost of the acquisition  will be expensed  restructuring costs associated with a business combination  which are presently capitalized  will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  contingencies  including contingent consideration  which are presently accounted for as an adjustment of purchase price  will be recorded at fair value with subsequent adjustments recognized in operations  and valuation allowances on acquired deferred tax assets  which are presently considered to be subsequent changes in consideration and are recorded as decreases in goodwill  will be recognized up front and in operations 
sfas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with an exception related to the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired contingencies related to acquisitions completed before the effective date 
we have not executed or currently plan to execute any business combinations on or subsequent to december  for the annual period 
we do not anticipate a material impact from this pronouncement on its financial position or results from operations upon adoption 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  an amendment of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which requires disclosures of the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging activities  the method of accounting for such instruments and activities under sfas no 
and its related interpretations  and disclosure of the affects of such instruments and related hedged items on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the statement encourages but does not require comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial application 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
we do not believe this statement will have a material financial impact on us but only enhance our current disclosures contained within our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets sfas  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas sfas enhances the guidance over the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under statement and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fasb statement no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption prohibited 
the measurement provision of this standard will apply only to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on our processes for determining and evaluating the useful life of its intangible assets 
in may  the fasb finalized fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion apb  which specifies the accounting for certain convertible debt instruments  including the company s convertible senior notes due convertible notes 
for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion  apb requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s economic interest cost 
the adoption of apb for our convertible notes will require the equity component of the convertible notes to be initially included in the paid in capital section of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets and the value of the equity component to be treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible notes 
higher interest expense will result by recognizing the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face amount as interest expense over the expected term of the convertible notes using an effective interest rate method of amortization 
apb is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
apb is not permitted to be adopted early and will be applied 
table of contents retrospectively to all periods presented 
we continue to evaluate the impact that the adoption of apb will have on our financial position and results of operations  but have preliminarily estimated that our other long term debt will be initially reduced by approximately million with a corresponding increase in additional paid in capital  which will be amortized as an accretion to the value of the convertible notes 
based upon the original amount outstanding  other interest expense will increase an average of approximately million per year  before income taxes  through the estimated redemption date of the convertible notes 
however  repurchases of our convertible notes  including those executed during the fourth quarter of  will reduce this additional interest charge on a prospective basis 
additionally  gains recognized during as a result of our repurchase of the convertible notes will be reduced in the retrospective application of apb critical accounting policies and accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies we use and the estimates and assumptions we make during their preparation 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 
critical accounting policies we have identified below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of all our significant accounting policies 
discontinued operations 
on june   we sold certain operations constituting our entire dealership holdings in one particular market that qualified for discontinued operations accounting and reporting treatment 
we have made certain reclassifications to our and consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows to reflect these operations as discontinued 
inventories 
we carry our new  used and demonstrator vehicle inventories  as well as our parts and accessories inventories  at the lower of cost or market in our consolidated balance sheets 
vehicle inventory cost consists of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  plus the cost of reconditioning  added equipment and transportation 
additionally  we receive interest assistance from some of our manufacturers 
this assistance is accounted for as a vehicle purchase price discount and is reflected as a reduction to the inventory cost on our balance sheets and as a reduction to cost of sales in our statements of operation as the vehicles are sold 
as the market value of our inventory typically declines over time  we establish reserves based on our historical loss experience and market trends 
these reserves are charged to cost of sales and reduce the carrying value of our inventory on hand 
used vehicles are complex to value as there is no standardized source for determining exact values and each vehicle and each market in which we operate is unique 
as a result  the value of each used vehicle taken at trade in  or purchased at auction  is determined based on industry data  primarily accessed via our used vehicle management software and the industry expertise of the responsible used vehicle manager 
our valuation risk is mitigated  somewhat  by how quickly we turn this inventory 
at december   our used vehicle days supply was days 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess  at the date of acquisition  of the purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we perform the annual impairment assessment at the end of each calendar year  or more frequently if events or circumstances at a reporting unit occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
based on the organization and management of our business prior to  each of our groups of dealerships formerly referred to as platforms qualified as reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill for impairment 
however  with our reorganization into three domestic regions in  and the corresponding changes in our management  operational and reporting structure we determined that goodwill should be evaluated at a regional level 
intangible franchise rights 
our only significant identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  are rights under our franchise agreements with manufacturers 
our dealerships franchise agreements are for various terms  ranging from one year to an indefinite period 
we expect these franchise agreements to continue indefinitely 
table of contents and  when these agreements do not have indefinite terms  we believe that renewal of these agreements can be obtained without substantial cost 
as such  we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for an indefinite period 
therefore  we do not amortize the carrying amount of our franchise rights 
franchise rights acquired in acquisitions prior to july   were not separately recorded  but were recorded and amortized as part of goodwill and remain a part of goodwill at december  and  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
like goodwill  we test our franchise rights for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment  using a fair value method 
retail finance  insurance and vehicle service contract revenues recognition 
we arrange financing for customers through various institutions and receive financing fees based on the difference between the loan rates charged to customers and predetermined financing rates set by the financing institution 
in addition  we receive fees from the sale of insurance and vehicle service contracts to customers 
further  through agreements that we have with certain vehicle service contract administrators  we earn volume incentive rebates and interest income on reserves  as well as participate in the underwriting profits of the products 
we may be charged back for unearned financing  insurance contract or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
revenues from these fees are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future amounts which might be charged back is established based on our historical chargeback results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
while our chargeback results vary depending on the type of contract sold  a change in the historical chargeback results used in determining our estimates of future amounts which might be charged back would have changed our reserve at december   by million 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
goodwill 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a combination of the discounted cash flow  or income  approach and the market approach 
included in the discounted cash flow are assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  future gross margins  future selling  general and administrative expenses and an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
we also must estimate residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements 
for the market approach  we utilize historical multiples of guideline companies 
each of these assumptions requires us to use our knowledge of our industry  our recent transactions and reasonable performance expectations for our operations 
if any one of the above assumptions change  in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with the reporting unit s 
specifically  with regards to the valuation assumptions utilized in our income approach as of december   we determined that  because of the significant uncertainty within the market and the corresponding increase in risk premiums  our weighted average cost of capital or wacc should be increased from historical levels 
in addition  based upon the negative selling trends experienced in the last several months of and the forecasts from multiple industry experts for  we utilized a seasonally adjusted annual rate or saar of million units for our industry sales outlook that was lower than our previous forecasts 
for and beyond  we used a saar trend based upon historical data and previous recession recoveries 
further  with regards to the assumptions within our market approach  we utilized recent market multiples of guideline companies for both revenue and pretax net income 
at december   and  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of its net assets step one of the impairment test 
as a result  we were not required to conduct the second step of the impairment test 
however  if any of our assumptions change  including in some cases insignificantly  or fails to 
table of contents materialize  the resulting decline in the estimated fair market value of goodwill could have resulted in a step two test of goodwill for impairment 
for example  if our assumptions regarding the risk free rate used in its estimated wacc as of december  increased by basis points or the estimated saar for decreased by approximately to all time record low levels and all other assumptions remained constant  we would have been required to perform a step two impairment test on goodwill for one of our reporting units 
however  in both scenarios  the application of step two of the goodwill impairment test would have required the assignment of value to other assets and liabilities  which we believe would have substantially or completely eliminated the shortfall in residual values of the reporting unit  resulting in an insignificant goodwill impairment charge  if any 
intangible franchise rights 
to test the carrying value of each individual franchise right for impairment under eitf d  we use a discounted cash flow based approach 
included in this analysis are assumptions  at a dealership level  regarding the cash flows directly attributable to the franchise right  revenue growth rates  future gross margins and future selling  general and administrative expenses 
using an estimated weighted average cost of capital  estimated residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements  we calculate the fair value of each dealership s franchise rights after considering estimated values for tangible assets  working capital and workforce 
if any one of the above assumptions change or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our intangible franchise rights estimated fair value could result in an additional impairment charge to the intangible franchise right associated with the applicable dealership 
for example  if our assumptions regarding risk free interest rates used in our estimated wacc used in our impairment analysis increased by basis points and all other assumptions remain constant  the resulting non cash franchise rights impairment charge would increase by million 
further  an approximate million unit decrease in the forecasted saar levels for to all time record low levels would have resulted in an additional non cash franchise rights impairment charge of million 
self insured property and casualty reserves 
we are self insured for a portion of the claims related to our property and casualty insurance programs  requiring us to make estimates regarding expected losses to be incurred 
we engage a third party actuary to conduct a study of the exposures under the self insured portion of our worker s compensation and general liability insurance programs for all open policy years 
we update this actuarial study on an annual basis and make the appropriate adjustments to our accrual 
actuarial estimates for the portion of claims not covered by insurance are based on our historical claims experience adjusted for loss trending and loss development factors 
changes in the frequency or severity of claims from historical levels could influence our reserve for claims and our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a change in the historical loss history used in determining our estimate of future losses would have changed our reserve for these losses at december   by million 
for workers compensation and general liability insurance policy years ended prior to october   this component of our insurance program included aggregate retention stop loss limits in addition to a per claim deductible limit the stop loss plans 
due to our historical experience in both claims frequency and severity  the likelihood of breaching the aggregate retention limits described above was deemed remote  and as such  we elected not to purchase this stop loss coverage for the policy year beginning november  and for each subsequent year the no stop loss plans 
our exposure per claim under the no stop loss plans is limited to million per occurrence  with unlimited exposure on the number of claims up to million that we may incur 
our maximum potential exposure under all of the stop loss plans originally totaled million  before consideration of amounts previously paid or accruals we have recorded related to our loss projections 
after consideration of the amounts paid or accrued  our remaining potential loss exposure under the stop loss plans totals million at december  fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
we account for our investments in marketable securities and debt instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity instruments as amended  which established standards of financial accounting and reporting for investments in equity instruments that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities 
accordingly  we designate these investments as available for sale  measure them at fair value and classify them as either cash and cash equivalents or 
table of contents other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based upon maturity terms and certain contractual restrictions 
as these investments are fairly liquid we believe our fair value techniques accurately reflect their market values and are subject to changes that are market driven and subject to demand and supply of the financial instrument markets 
we maintain multiple trust accounts comprised of money market funds with short term investments in marketable securities  such as us government securities  commercial paper and bankers acceptances  that have maturities of less than three months 
the valuation measurement inputs of these marketable securities represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets 
also within our trust accounts  we hold investments in debt instruments  such as government obligations and other fixed income securities 
the debt securities are measured based upon quoted market prices utilizing public information  independent external valuations from pricing services or third party advisors 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we utilize an interest rate hedging strategy in order to stabilize earnings exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates 
we measure our interest rate derivative instruments utilizing an income approach valuation technique  converting future amounts of cash flows to a single present value in order to obtain a transfer exit price within the bid and ask spread that is most representative of the fair value of our derivative instruments 
in measuring fair value  we utilize the option pricing black scholes present value technique for all of our derivative instruments 
this option pricing technique utilizes a libor forward yield curve  obtained from an independent external service provider  matched to the identical maturity term of the instrument being measured 
observable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation technique incorporate identical contractual notional amounts  fixed coupon rates  periodic terms for interest payments and contract maturity 
we have determined the valuation measurement inputs of these derivative instruments to maximize the use of observable inputs that market participants would use in pricing similar or identical instruments and market data obtained from independent sources  which is readily observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the derivative instrument 
further  the valuation measurement inputs minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
we validate the outputs of our valuation technique by comparison to valuations from the respective counterparties 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we estimate the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  which involves the use of various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions  and those requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of property and equipment and intangible franchise rights  with the remaining attributable to goodwill  if any 
we utilize third party experts to determine the fair values of property and equipment purchased 
income taxes 
we have recognized deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  that we believe will be realized  based primarily on the assumption of future taxable income 
we also have recognized million of state net operating loss carryforwards as of december  that will expire between and to the extent that we have determined that net income attributable to certain state jurisdictions will not be sufficient to realize these net operating losses  we have established a corresponding valuation allowance 
results of operations the same store amounts presented below include the results of dealerships for the identical months in each period presented in the comparison  commencing with the first full month in which the dealership was owned by us and  in the case of dispositions  ending with the last full month it was owned by us 
same store results also include the activities of our corporate headquarters

the level of retail sales  as well as our own ability to retain or grow market share  during future periods is difficult to predict 
our same store gross margin on new vehicle retail sales decreased basis points from to the sustained slowdown in the national economy and in most of the markets in which we operate continued to depress new retail vehicle sales  increasing overall new vehicle inventory levels and competitive pressure on all of our brands and causing the shrinkage in margins 
we experienced a decrease in same store new vehicle gross margin in most of our major brands 
further depressing new vehicle margins in was the shift in customer preference towards more fuel efficient vehicles during most of the year  which largely affected our truck dependent domestic brands  as well as the truck lines of our import brands

most manufacturers offer interest assistance to offset floorplan interest charges incurred in connection with inventory purchases 
this assistance varies by manufacturer  but generally provides for a defined amount regardless of our actual floorplan interest rate or the length of time for which the inventory is financed 
the amount of interest assistance we recognize in a given period is primarily a function of the mix of units being sold  as domestic brands tend to provide more assistance  and the specific terms of the respective manufacturers interest assistance programs and wholesale interest rates  the average wholesale price of inventory sold  and our rate of inventory turn 
for these reasons  this assistance has ranged from approximately to of our total floorplan interest expense over the past three years 
we record these incentives as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales as the vehicles are sold  which therefore impact the gross profit and gross margin detailed above

capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures include expenditures to extend the useful life of current facilities and expenditures to start or expand operations 
historically  our annual capital expenditures  exclusive of new or expanded operations  have approximately equaled our annual depreciation charge 
in general  expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities are driven by new franchises being granted to us by a manufacturer  significant growth in sales at an existing facility  dealership acquisition activity  or manufacturer imaging programs 
due to the current and near term projected economical conditions  we have substantially reduced our capital expenditure forecast for to be less than million  generally funded from excess cash  primarily to maintain existing facilities or complete projects initiated in acquisitions

total cash consideration paid  net of cash received  of million  included million for related real estate and the incurrence of million of inventory financing 
we purchase businesses based on expected return on investment 
in general  the purchase price  excluding real estate and floorplan liabilities  is approximately to of the annual revenue 
cash needed to complete our acquisitions comes from excess working capital  operating cash flows of our dealerships  and borrowings under our floorplan facilities and our acquisition line 
due to the current economic environment  we do not anticipate completing any dealership acquisitions in purchase of convertible note hedge 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes in  we purchased ten year call options on our common stock the purchased options 
under the terms of the purchased options  which become exercisable upon conversion of the convertible notes  we have the right to purchase a total of approximately million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the total cost of the purchased options was million 
the cost of the purchased options results in future income tax deductions that we expect will total approximately million 

table of contents in addition to the purchase of the purchased options  we sold warrants in separate transactions the warrants 
these warrants have a ten year term and enable the holders to acquire shares of our common stock from us 
the warrants are exercisable for a maximum of million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment for quarterly dividends in excess of per quarter  liquidation  bankruptcy  or a change in control of our company and other conditions 
subject to these adjustments  the maximum amount of shares of our common stock that could be required to be issued under the warrants is million shares 
the proceeds from the sale of the warrants were million 
the purchased option and warrant transactions were designed to increase the conversion price per share of our common stock from to a premium to the closing price of our common stock on the date that the convertible notes were priced to investors and  therefore  mitigate the potential dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes  if any 
no shares of our common stock have been issued or received under the purchased options or the warrants 
since the price of our common stock was less than at december   the intrinsic value of both the purchased options and the warrants  as expressed in shares of our common stock  was zero 
changes in the price of our common stock will impact the share settlement of the convertible notes  the purchased options and the warrants as illustrated below shares in thousands net share entitlement shares shares issuable under the issuable potential company under the purchased under net shares eps stock price notes options the warrants issuable dilution in thousands for dilutive earnings per share calculations  we will be required to include the dilutive effect  if applicable  of the net shares issuable under the convertible notes and the warrants as depicted in the table above under the heading potential eps dilution 
although the purchased options have the economic benefit of decreasing the dilutive effect of the convertible notes  for earnings per share purposes we cannot factor this benefit into our dilutive shares outstanding as their impact would be anti dilutive 
stock repurchases 
we generally fund our stock repurchases from excess cash 
in august  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase a number of shares equivalent to the shares issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan on a quarterly basis

provisions of our credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes require us to maintain certain financial ratios and limit the amount of disbursements we may make outside the ordinary course of business 
these include limitations on the payment of cash dividends and on stock repurchases  which are limited to a percentage of cumulative net income 
as of december   our notes were the most restrictive agreement with respect to such limits 
this amount will increase or decrease in future periods by adding to the current limitation the sum of of our consolidated net income  if positive  and of equity issuances  less actual dividends or stock repurchases completed in each quarterly period

we  acting through our subsidiaries  are the lessee under many real estate leases that provide for our use of the respective dealership premises 
generally  our real estate and facility leases have year total terms with initial terms of years and three additional five year terms  at our option 
pursuant to these leases  our subsidiaries generally agree to indemnify the lessor and other parties from certain liabilities arising as a result of the use of the leased premises  including environmental liabilities  or a breach of the lease by the lessee 
additionally  from time to time  we enter into agreements in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the purchaser  or other parties  from certain liabilities or costs arising in connection with the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of business in connection with purchases or sales of goods and services  we enter into agreements that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability would be limited by the terms of the applicable agreement 
from time to time  primarily in connection with dealership dispositions  our subsidiaries assign or sublet to the dealership purchaser the subsidiaries interests in any real property leases associated with such stores 
in general  our subsidiaries retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases to the extent that the assignee or sublessee does not perform  whether such performance is required prior to or following the assignment or subletting of the lease 
additionally  we and our subsidiaries generally remain subject to the terms of any guarantees made by us and our subsidiaries in connection with such leases 
although we generally have indemnification rights against the assignee or sublessee in the event of non performance under these leases  as well as certain defenses  and we presently have no reason to believe that we or our subsidiaries will be called on to perform under any such assigned leases or subleases  we estimate that lessee rental payment obligations during the remaining terms of these leases are approximately million at december  we and our subsidiaries also may be called on to perform other obligations under these leases  such as environmental remediation of the leased premises or repair of the leased premises upon termination of the lease  although we presently have no reason to believe that we or our subsidiaries will be called on to so perform and such obligations cannot be quantified at this time 
our exposure under these leases is difficult to estimate and there can be no assurance that any performance by us or our subsidiaries required under these leases would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments constitutes a forward looking statement 
interest rates 
we have interest rate risk in our variable rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
our policy is to manage interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps 
at december   our outstanding convertible notes and notes  which is primarily all of our fixed rate debt  totaled million and had a fair value of million 
at december   we had million of variable rate floorplan borrowings outstanding  million of variable rate mortgage facility borrowings outstanding and million of variable rate acquisition facility borrowings outstanding 
based on the aggregate amount  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our interest expense 
after consideration of the interest rate swaps described below  a basis point increase would yield a net increase of million 
we received million of interest assistance from certain automobile manufacturers during the year ended december  this assistance is reflected as a million reduction of our new vehicle cost of sales for the year ended december   and reduced our new vehicle inventory by million and million at december  and  respectively 
for the past three years  the reduction to our new vehicle cost of sales has ranged from approximately to of our floorplan interest expense 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future interest assistance  it is our expectation  based on historical data that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased assistance from certain manufacturers 
we use interest rate swaps to adjust our exposure to interest rate movements when appropriate based upon market conditions 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
we reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our balance sheet 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
all of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
the hedge instruments are designed to convert floating rate vehicle floorplan payables under our revolving credit facility to fixed rate debt 
during  we entered into two interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million 
the hedge instruments are designed to convert floating rate vehicle floorplan payables under the company s revolving credit facility to fixed rate debt 
one swap  with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of approximately and expires in august and the other with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of approximately and expires in march during  we entered into eight interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million  comprised of one swap with a million notional value that effectively locks in an interest rate of approximately and the remaining seven swaps each with a notional value of million that effectively lock in an interest rate ranging from to 
all of the swaps entered into expire in the latter half of in december  we entered into two interest rate swaps with notional values of million each  and in january  we entered into a third interest rate swap with a notional value of million 
one swap  with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of  the second swap  also with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of  and the third swap  with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of 
all three of the hedge instruments expire december  at december   net unrealized losses  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled million 
at december   net unrealized losses  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled million 
at december   net unrealized gains  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income totaled million 
the increase in net unrealized losses from to was primarily a result of the decline in interest rates experienced during the year 
at december   and  all of our derivative contracts were determined to be highly effective  and no ineffective portion was recognized in income 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we had dealership operations in the uk the functional currency of our uk subsidiaries is the pound sterling 
we intend to remain permanently invested in these foreign operations and  as such  do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
if we change our intent with respect to such international investment  we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
a percent increase in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would have resulted in a million change to our revenues for the year ended december
