overview the company is the nation s largest domestic inland tank barge operator with a fleet of active tank barges and towing vessels 
the company uses the united states inland waterway system to transport bulk liquids including petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals 
the company also owns and operates four ocean going barge and tug units transporting dry bulk commodities in united states coastwise trade 
through its diesel engine services segment  the company provides after market services for medium speed and high speed diesel engines used in marine  power generation and railroad applications 
for  the company reported record revenue  net earnings and earnings per share for the fifth straight year 
the company reported net earnings of  or per share  on revenues of  a significant improvement over the net earnings of  or per share  on revenues of  and net earnings of  or per share  on revenues of  the results included an estimated 
per share negative impact from hurricanes gustav and ike 
hurricane gustav made landfall between houma and morgan city  louisiana on september  creating disruptions to the company s gulf coast diesel engine services operations  the company s four gulf coast based offshore barge and tug units  and the inland marine transportation operations in louisiana 
hurricane ike made landfall on september in the houston galveston area as a strong category hurricane 
because of ike s size and its unpredictable course  much of the gulf coast petrochemical and refining capacity was shut down prior to landfall 
strong winds and a to foot storm surge significantly affected petrochemical and refining plants in the houston and port arthur beaumont area  some of which are still not back in operation or are operating at reduced levels 
additionally  an eight mile stretch of the gulf intracoastal waterway just east of houston was closed due to obstructions for days after ike s landfall  completely stopping movements to and from the houston area 
hurricanes ike and gustav caused no material damage to the company s active tank barge and towboat fleet  but the marine transportation and diesel engine services facilities did incur some damage 
during the fourth quarter  in response to the deteriorating united states and global economic environment  petrochemical and refining companies announced a number of plant closures and volume reductions in order to reduce inventories  which reduced upriver movements of more finished petrochemical products to the end users 
in addition  the company increased its general reserve for doubtful accounts in the fourth quarter by  before taxes  or 
per share  due to the deteriorating economic environment 
marine transportation for  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by its marine transportation segment 
the segment s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies that operate in the united states 
products transported include raw materials for many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers every day plastics  fiber  paints  detergents  oil additives and paper  among others 
consequently  the company s business tends to mirror the general performance of the united states economy and volumes produced by the company s customer base  enhanced by the inherent efficiencies of barge transportation which is generally the lowest cost mode of surface transportation

with the deteriorating economic environment during the fourth quarter  petrochemical customers responded with numerous plant closures and volume reductions in order to reduce inventories  thereby reducing upriver movements of more finished petrochemical products to the end users 
the black oil market remained strong  despite some lower refinery utilization 
the refined products market experienced continued softness in the movement of products from the gulf coast to the midwest as a result of lower gasoline demand due to higher gasoline prices 
the agricultural chemical market was strong during the first quarter and a portion of the second quarter until upper mississippi river flooding in june and july curtailed the traditional spring planting season 
high midwest inventory levels negatively impacted the second half of marine transportation revenues for benefited from the recovery of higher diesel fuel costs through contract fuel escalation clauses on all term affreightment contracts and time charter contracts 
fuel escalation clauses are designed to recover additional fuel costs when fuel prices rise and rebate fuel costs when prices decline  however  there is generally a to day delay before the contracts are adjusted 
during  approximately of marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot market revenues 
time charters  which insulate the company from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines  averaged of the revenues under term contracts during rates on term contract renewals  net of fuel  increased during in the to average range  with some contracts increasing by a higher percentage and some by a lower percentage  compared with effective january   annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of multi year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts by to  excluding fuel 
for  spot market rates  which include the cost of fuel  increased in the to average range when compared with the marine transportation operating margin for was compared with for strong demand in the majority of the segment s markets through the first nine months of  higher term contract and spot market pricing  the january  escalators on numerous multi year contracts  operating efficiencies from continued improvement in vessel crewing and the increased percentage of time charters which protects revenues from navigational and weather delays and temporary market declines  had a positive impact on the operating income and operating margin 
partially offsetting these positive factors was the loss of revenue and additional operating expenses associated with hurricanes gustav and ike 
during the fourth quarter  the demand for 
table of contents upriver movements of petrochemicals weakened and the allowance for doubtful accounts was increased  partially offset by a reduction in the number of charter boats operated and lower diesel fuel prices 
diesel engine services during  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by its diesel engine services segment  of which was generated through service and from direct parts sales 
the results of the diesel engine services segment are largely influenced by the economic cycles of the industries it serves 
the following table shows the markets serviced by the company  the revenue distribution for  and the customers for each market revenue markets serviced distribution customers marine inland river carriers dry and liquid  offshore towing dry and liquid  offshore oilfield services drilling rigs supply boats  harbor towing  dredging  great lakes ore carriers power generation standby power generation  pumping stations railroad passenger transit systems  class ii  shortline  industrial the diesel engine services segment s revenue and operating income increased and  respectively  compared with the results were positively impacted by strong engine overhaul and field repair activity and direct parts sales in the majority of its medium speed markets through the first nine months of during the fourth quarter  the medium speed market saw service levels and direct parts sales weaken as its customers activities slowed  particularly in the power generation and railroad markets  and from seasonal fluctuations in the marine markets 
the high speed market  including the acquisition of saunders in july and lake charles diesel in june  experienced continued softness in the gulf coast oil services market during  but did reflect some modest improvement in the fourth quarter  primarily the result of repairs to customers equipment damaged by hurricanes gustav and ike 
in addition  the segment benefited from higher service rates and parts pricing implemented in both its medium speed and high speed markets during and the segment was negatively impacted by hurricane gustav in early september  which resulted in the closure of the segment s gulf coast facilities for several days  as well as customer facilities and operations in the path of the hurricane 
operating income for the diesel engine services segment for increased compared with  primarily reflecting strong medium speed service activity and direct parts sales in the majority of its markets and high labor utilization through the first nine months  and higher service rates and parts pricing implemented during  partially offset by softness in its medium speed market in the fourth quarter and continued softness throughout in its gulf coast high speed market  primarily the gulf coast oil services market  and the negative impact of hurricane gustav as noted above 
the diesel engine services operating margin for was  a slight decrease when compared with for the decrease reflected softness throughout in the oil services sector of the high speed market and resulting lower labor utilization  partially offset by continued strong demand  high labor utilization and stronger pricing for the first nine months of in the medium speed markets 
the medium speed market did slow in the fourth quarter  primarily in the power generation and railroad markets  and a higher percentage of its revenues were from lower margin engine and equipment sales 
cash flow and capital expenditures the company continued to generate strong operating cash flow during  with net cash provided by operating activities of  a increase compared with  in in addition  during  the company generated cash from the exercise of stock options of  and from the disposition of assets of  cash and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility were used for capital expenditures of  including  for new tank barge and towboat construction and  primarily for upgrading the existing marine transportation fleet   for the acquisitions of orix and lake charles diesel  and for purchases of the company s common stock of  the company s debt to capitalization ratio decreased to at december  from at december   primarily due to the increase in 
table of contents stockholders equity attributable to net earnings for of  the exercise of stock options  issuance of restricted stock and lower outstanding debt  partially offset by common stock repurchases 
the company projects that capital expenditures for will be in the  to  range  including approximately  for new tank barge and towboat construction 
the new construction presently consists of barges with a total capacity of  barrels and five horsepower towboats 
delivery is anticipated to be throughout the company anticipates that in seven new barges under a seven year charter with a total capacity of  barrels will be placed in service 
the company also anticipates that new capacity for will likely approximate capacity to be retired 
for  new construction commitments include one barge with a total capacity of  barrels and two horsepower towboats  all of which are from orders 
the company s strong cash flow and unutilized loan facilities position the company to take advantage of internal and external growth opportunities in its marine transportation and diesel engine services segments 
the marine transportation segment s external growth opportunities include potential acquisitions of independent inland tank barge operators and captive fleet owners seeking to outsource tank barge requirements 
increasing the fleet size would allow the company to improve asset utilization through more backhaul opportunities  faster barge turnarounds  more efficient use of horsepower  barges positioned closer to cargoes  less cleaning due to operating more barges with compatible prior cargoes  lower incremental costs due to enhanced purchasing power and minimal incremental administrative staff 
the diesel engine services segment s external growth opportunities include further consolidation of strategically located diesel service providers  and expanded service capability for other engine and marine gear related products 
the company s visibility for is not clear  as the united states and global recession has resulted in petrochemical and refining plant closures  reduced production and employee layoffs in response to the deteriorating economic conditions 
during  approximately of marine transportation revenues were under term contracts  of which approximately are up for renewal during based on current market conditions and limited visibility  the company anticipates that renewals of term contracts during will be at or near rate levels 
spot market rates for will be driven by volumes and equipment utilization 
in and  some incremental capacity was added to the industry fleet and absorbed due to the strong market conditions 
the company anticipates some additional capacity will be added during based on current orders  however  recent reductions in petrochemical and refining output have resulted in excess tank barge capacity and lower utilization 
weaker market conditions and limited financing availability may constrain new barge orders for and the retirement of older barges may be accelerated 
additionally  the company anticipates that the diesel engine services segment will perform below levels 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below 
it is also suggested that the company s significant accounting policies  as described in the company s financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business 
the company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectible receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the 
table of contents financial strength of the company s customers  however  the current united states and global recession could impact the collectability of certain customer s trade receivables which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
property  maintenance and repairs 
property is recorded at cost 
improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred 
depreciation is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets 
when property items are retired  sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in the statement of earnings 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment by vessel class whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
the assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used  and estimated salvage values 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase are included in goodwill 
management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average weighted cost of capital 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
accrued insurance 
the company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk cargo in a marine environment 
the company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible  below which the company is liable 
in addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred  the company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the company  or are not yet fully developed 
the company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of reserves 
if the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed  the required level of reserves for claims incurred but not reported or fully developed could be materially understated 
the company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the company s deductible 
if the solvency of the insurers became impaired  there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance

table of contents movements of petrochemicals weakened during the fourth quarter 
the third quarter was negatively impacted by hurricanes gustav and ike  more fully described above 
the petrochemical market  the company s largest market  contributed of the marine transportation revenue for during the first nine months of  the demand for the movement of petrochemical products remained strong  with term contract customers continuing to operate their plants and facilities at high utilization rates until the september hurricanes  resulting in high tank barge utilization 
with the deteriorating economic environment during the fourth quarter  petrochemical customers responded with numerous plant closures and volume reductions in order to reduce inventories  thereby reducing upriver movements of more finished petrochemical products to the end users 
the black oil products market contributed of marine transportation revenue reflecting relatively strong demand throughout refined petroleum products contributed of marine transportation revenue  experiencing softness in the movement of products from the gulf coast to the midwest  driven by higher gasoline prices and resulting lower gasoline demand  but benefiting from more gulf intracoastal waterway movements 
the agricultural chemical market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  was unseasonably strong during the first quarter in advance of the traditional spring planting season  remained strong during the first two months of the second quarter until upper mississippi river flooding in june and july curtailed the traditional spring planting season 
high midwest inventory levels negatively impacted the second half of the marine transportation segment operated an average of towboats during compared with during the company continued to make progress in the crewing of its towboats as essentially all company owned towboats were fully crewed during the company operated an average of during the first nine months and operated an average of towboats in the fourth quarter 
the company has historically used chartered towboats for approximately one third of its horsepower requirements 
during the fourth quarter  the company began releasing chartered towboats as demand softened  thereby balancing horsepower needs with current requirements 
as of december   the company operated chartered towboats and as of february   the company operated chartered towboats 
for  the marine transportation segment incurred  delay days  in line with the  delay days for delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow towboat and one or more tank barges during transit when the tow is stopped due to weather  lock congestion and other navigational factors 
the delay days do not reflect the lost time incurred during hurricane ike as the houston and port arthur beaumont area petrochemical and refining facilities closed in advance of the hurricane and  due to lack of power or facility damage  did not reopen until several days after the hurricane and in some cases did not reopen or operated at reduced levels 
excluding the hurricanes  delay days for reflected ice and high water conditions in the midwest and frontal systems along the gulf coast in the first quarter  high water conditions throughout the mississippi river system during the majority of the second quarter and favorable operating conditions during july and august and the fourth quarter 
this compares with which reflected milder winter weather conditions and more normal water levels 
the delay days recorded in the second quarter did not reflect the slower transit times caused by weather issues and high water conditions  which in some cases  resulted in the deployment of additional towboats in order to meet customer delivery schedules 
during  approximately of marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot market revenues  compared with a term contract and spot market mix for the first half and contract and spot market mix for the second half 
time charters  which insulate the company from revenue fluctuations caused by winter weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines  averaged of the revenues under term contracts during the increase during in the term contract percentage was attributable to heavier demand for marine transportation services by the company s term contract customers 
the contract and spot market mix provides the company with a predictable revenue stream while maintaining spot market exposure to take advantage of new business opportunities and existing customers peak demands

the significantly higher price of diesel fuel consumed  as noted below  resulted in higher fuel costs during the first nine months 
during  the company consumed million gallons of diesel fuel compared with million gallons consumed during the lower fuel consumption was a reflection of the use of more fuel efficient engines in the towboats  less petrochemical  refined products and agricultural chemical movements into the midwest from the gulf coast  as discussed above  and less activity along the gulf coast in preparation for  during and after hurricanes gustav and ike 
the average price per gallon of diesel fuel consumed during was  an increase of compared with per gallon for fuel escalation clauses are designed to recover additional fuel costs when fuel prices rise and rebate fuel costs when prices decline  however  there is generally a to day delay before the contracts are adjusted 
spot market contracts do not have escalators for fuel

the year also included a  increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts   of which was recorded in the fourth quarter  the result of the deteriorating united states and global economic environment 
taxes  other than on income  for decreased compared with  primarily the reflection of lower waterway user taxes  partially offset by higher state franchise taxes and property taxes 
depreciation and amortization for increased compared with the increases were primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures  including new tank barges and towboats  and the acquisitions in and of marine equipment that was previously leased 
marine transportation operating income and operating margins the marine transportation operating income for increased compared with the marine transportation operating margin for was compared with for strong demand in the majority of the segment s markets through the first nine months of  higher term contract and spot market pricing  the january  escalators on numerous multi year contracts  operating efficiencies from continued improvement in vessel crewing and the increased percentage of time charters which protects revenues from navigational and weather delays and temporary market declines  had a positive impact on the operating income and operating margin 
partially offsetting these positive factors was the loss of revenue and additional operating expenses associated with hurricanes gustav and ike 
during the fourth quarter  demand for upriver movements of petrochemicals weakened and the allowance for doubtful accounts was increased  partially offset by a reduction in the number of charter boats operated and lower diesel fuel prices

the demand for marine transportation of petrochemicals and gasoline blending components remained strong throughout as term contract customers  mainly large united states petrochemical and refining companies  
table of contents continued to operate their plants and facilities at high utilization rates  resulting in continued high barge utilization for most products and trade lanes 
black oil products demand during remained strong as refineries continued to operate at close to full capacity  which generated heavy demand for waterborne transportation of heavier residual oil by products by barge 
refined petroleum products demand for transportation into the midwest during was stronger than normal 
agricultural chemical demand was seasonally strong during  benefiting from high demand for the movement of liquid fertilizer into the midwest  partially the result of record united states corn production 
the company acquired an additional one third interest in osprey in january  increasing the company s ownership to  and purchased in march the remaining of the dixie fuels partnership  bringing the company s ownership to
