item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview bancorp provides a wide range of retail and commercial banking services 
deposit services include checking  individual retirement accounts  money market  savings and time deposit accounts 
loan services include various types of commercial  consumer  and real estate lending 
the company also provides atms  corporate cash management services  debit cards  internet banking including on line bill pay  mortgage lending  safe deposit boxes  and telephone banking  among other products and services 
bancorp continues to experience challenges similarly faced by many financial institutions resulting from the slowdown in the real estate markets  including increased loan delinquencies and a decrease in the demand for certain loan products including construction  development  and land acquisition loans 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses and other factors  have adversely affected bancorp s borrowers 
this economic deterioration has caused loan delinquencies and impaired loans to increase 
in addition  strong competition for new loans and deposits has caused the interest rate spread between the company s cost of funds and what it earns on loans to decrease from levels 
this was primarily due to an increase in non accrual loans  and to decreases in interest rates earned on loans outpacing the decreases in interest paid on deposits and other borrowings 
even though bancorp s total loan portfolio has increased from  the decrease in the interest rate spread has caused net interest income to decrease from in addition  bancorp has experienced an increase in loan delinquencies  which resulted in the allowance for loan losses to increase from the decrease in net interest income and the increase in the allowance for loan losses  coupled with increased costs relating to foreclosures have caused bancorp s overall profitability to decrease from the company expects to experience continued difficult market conditions in as it seeks to grow its loan portfolio in a difficult market environment 
if interest rates increase  there may be less demand for borrowing and  the company s interest rate spread could decrease 
the company will continue to manage loan and deposit pricing against the risks of rising costs of its deposits and borrowings 
interest rates are outside the control of bancorp  so it must attempt to balance its pricing and duration of its loan portfolio against the risks of rising costs of its deposits and borrowings 
the continued success and attraction of anne arundel county  maryland  and vicinity  will also be important to bancorp s ability to originate and grow its mortgage loans and deposits  as will bancorp s continued focus on maintaining a low overhead 
in november  bancorp completed two private placements the sale to certain accredited investors of bancorp s series a preferred stock and subordinated notes for gross proceeds of million  and the sale to the treasury department under the tarp capital purchase program of bancorp s series b preferred stock and common stock warrants for gross proceeds of approximately million 
bancorp intends to use the proceeds to fund new loan originations  expand relationship banking  provide additional capital for regulatory purposes and other general corporate purposes 
the recently enacted emergency economic stabilization act of eesa also increased fdic deposit insurance on most accounts from  to  this increase is in place until the end of and is not covered by deposit insurance premiums paid by the banking industry 
in addition  the fdic has implemented two temporary programs to provide deposit insurance for the full amount of most non interest bearing transaction accounts through the end of and to guarantee certain unsecured debt of financial institutions and their holding companies through june we expect to participate only in the program that provides unlimited deposit insurance coverage through december  for noninterest bearing transaction accounts typically business checking accounts and certain funds swept into noninterest bearing savings accounts 
under that program  we will pay a basis points fee annualized on the balance of each covered account in excess of  while the extra deposit insurance is in place 
at december   we had million in such accounts in excess of  if the volatility in the market and the economy continue or worsen  our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to funds and the price of our stock could be materially and adversely impacted 
critical accounting policies bancorp s significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements are set forth in note of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  which are set forth on pages f through f of these significant accounting policies  bancorp considers the policies regarding the allowance for loan losses and valuation of foreclosed real estate to be its most critical accounting policies  given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
in addition  changes in economic conditions can have a significant impact on real estate values of underlying collateral affecting the allowance for loan losses and therefore the provision for loan losses and results of operations as well as the valuation of foreclosed real estate 
bancorp has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to its loan portfolio 
bancorp s assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations  and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers that is not known to management at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition total assets increased by  or  at december  to  compared to  at december  the following discusses the material changes between the december  and balance sheets

this increase was the result of bancorp s focus on community lending and increased marketing efforts 
the increase in the loan portfolio was primarily due to an increase in residential loan demand  refinancing of existing mortgages and an increase in funding of commercial loan obligations partially offset by a decrease in construction  land acquisition and development loans 
premises and equipment premises and equipment decreased by  or at december  to  compared to  at december  this decrease was primarily due to the annual depreciation of the premises and equipment with minimal new fixed assets added throughout other assets other assets increased by  or at december  to  compared to  at december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in foreclosed real estate in liabilities deposits

unadvanced construction loans decreased  or as of december  to  compared to  as of december  this decrease was primarily the result of increased funding of existing construction loan obligations in addition to a decrease in new construction loan originations 
home equity lines of credit increased  or  as of december  to  compared to  as of december  home equity lines of credit allow the borrowers to draw funds up to a specified loan amount  from time to time 
bancorp s management believes it has sufficient liquidity resources to have the funding available as these borrowers draw on these loans

loan commitments are obligations of bancorp to provide loans  and such commitments are made in the usual course of business 
lines of credit  which are obligations of bancorp to fund loans made to certain borrowers  increased  or  to  as of december   compared to  as of december  the increase was a result of stronger demand for this type of loan product during bancorp s management believes it has sufficient liquidity resources to have the funding available as these borrowers draw on these loans 
loans sold and serviced with limited repurchase provisions decreased  or  as of december  to  compared to  as of december  this decrease was the result of the slowdown in the market for loans sold on the secondary market 
bancorp uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for its on balance sheet instruments 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
bancorp s net income for the year ended december  was  or per share diluted 
this is compared to  or per share diluted in this decrease of  or  was primarily the result of bancorp experiencing similar challenges faced by many financial institutions caused by the slowdown in the overall economy  including increased loan delinquencies and a compression of its interest rate margin  as well as increased foreclosure related costs 
net interest income 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bancorp s interest rate spread partially offset by an increase in its loan portfolio 
bancorp s interest rate spread decreased by to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of interest rates earned on bancorp s loan portfolio decreasing faster than the decrease in interest rates paid on bancorp s interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  bancorp s non accrual loans increased from  at december  to  at december  bancorp discontinues the accrual of interest on all non accrual loans  at which time all previously accrued but uncollected interest is deducted from income 
this resulted in  of interest income not recorded on these loans 
bancorp is uncertain whether it will be able to reduce the interest rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities by attracting lower cost deposits  due to the general expectation of continued increased competition for deposit accounts 
provision for loan losses 
the bank s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk and an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
credit risk includes  but is not limited to  the potential for borrower default and the failure of collateral to be worth what the bank determined it was worth at the time of the granting of the loan 
the bank monitors its loan portfolio at least as often as quarterly and its loan delinquencies at least as often as monthly 
all loans that are delinquent and all loans within the various categories of the bank s portfolio as a group are evaluated 
the bank s board  with the advice and recommendation of the bank s delinquency committee  estimates an allowance to be set aside for loan losses 
included in determining the calculation are such factors as the current market value of the loan s underlying collateral  inherent risk contained within the portfolio after considering the state of the general economy  economic trends  consideration of particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending and consideration of known information that may affect loan collectibility 
an increase in the loan loss provision from the beginning of the year to the end of a year is the result after an analysis of the aforementioned factors and applying that rationale to the total portfolio 
the total allowance for loan losses increased  or to  as of december   compared to  as of december  the increase was a result of the current year s addition to the allowance partially offset by charge offs incurred 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or was a result of an increase in loan delinquencies  an increase in the loan portfolio  and management s determination that adding to the provision for loan losses was appropriate for the level of inherent risk in its portfolio as compared to the year ended december  bancorp continues to experience challenges similarly faced by many financial institutions resulting from the slowdown in the economy and real estate markets  including increased loan delinquencies 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses and other factors  have adversely affected bancorp s borrowers 
this economic deterioration has caused loan delinquencies and impaired loans to increase 
bancorp expects loan delinquencies and impaired loans to continue to increase in other income and non interest expenses 
revenues from mortgage banking activities decreased  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this net decrease was primarily the result of a  increase in gain on sale of loans  offset by a decrease in mortgage processing and servicing fees of  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to a general slowdown in loan activity  which resulted in fewer loans sold on the secondary market  but at higher gains during and less mortgage processing and servicing released fees during real estate commissions decreased  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of commissions earned on large settlements that took place during real estate management fees increased  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased fees charged in other non interest income increased  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher letters of credit fees

liquidity and capital resources 
in  bancorp s sources of liquidity were loan repayments  maturing investments  deposits  borrowed funds  sale of equity  and the sale of loans 
bancorp considers core deposits stable funding sources and includes all deposits  except time deposits of  or more 
at december   core deposits equaled of total deposits 
the bank s experience has been that a substantial portion of certificates of deposit renew at time of maturity and remain on deposit with the bank 
additionally  loan payments  maturities  deposit growth and earnings contributed to bancorp s flow of funds 
in addition to its ability to generate deposits  bancorp has external sources of funds  which may be drawn upon when desired 
the primary source of external liquidity is an available line of credit equal to of the bank s assets with fhlb atlanta 
the available line of credit with fhlb atlanta was  at december   of which  was outstanding at that time 
short term borrowings were and long term advances were  at december  the maturities of these long term advances at december  were as follows dollars in thousands rate amount maturity to to thereafter as of december   bancorp had outstanding an aggregate of  principal amount of subordinated debt  consisting of the debentures and the subordinated notes 
the debentures total  pay interest quarterly at a floating rate of interest of libor december  plus basis points  and mature on january  the subordinated notes total  and pay interest at an annual rate of  payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of march  june  september and december commencing december  the subordinated notes are redeemable in whole or in part at the option of bancorp at any time beginning on december  until maturity  which is december  as of december   bancorp had  outstanding in loan commitments  which bancorp expects to fund from the sources of liquidity described above 
this amount does not include undisbursed lines of credit  home equity lines of credit and standby letters of credit  in the aggregate amount of  at december   which bancorp anticipates it will be able to fund  if required  from these liquidity sources in the regular course of business 
in addition to the foregoing  the payment of dividends is a use of cash  but is not expected to have a material effect on liquidity 
as of december   bancorp had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possible additional discretionary  actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
management believes  as of december   that the bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject 
we anticipate that our primary sources of liquidity in fiscal will be from loan repayments  maturing investments  deposits  borrowed funds  and the sale of loans 
we believe that these sources of liquidity will be enough for bancorp to meet its liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
cash generated from these liquidity sources may be affected by a number of factors 
see risk factors for a discussion of the factors that can negatively impact the amount of cash we could receive

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qualitative information about market risk 
the principal objective of bancorp s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risks appropriate given bancorp s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with bancorp s interest rate risk management policy 
through this management  bancorp seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the board of directors of bancorp is responsible for reviewing assets liability policies and interest rate risk position 
the board of directors reviews the interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis and  in connection with this review  evaluates bancorp s business activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on bancorp s net interest margin and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on bancorp s loan portfolio 
while continuous movement of interest rates is certain  the extent and timing of these movements is not always predictable 
any movement in interest rates has an effect on bancorp s profitability 
bancorp faces the risk that rising interest rates could cause the cost of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  to rise faster than the yield on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments 
bancorp s interest rate spread and interest rate margin may be negatively impacted in a declining interest rate environment even though bancorp generally borrows at short term interest rates and lends at longer term interest rates 
this is because loans and other interest earning assets may be prepaid and replaced with lower yielding assets before the supporting interest bearing liabilities reprice downward 
bancorp s interest rate margin may also be negatively impacted in a flat or inverse yield curve environment 
mortgage origination activity tends to increase when interest rates trend lower and decrease when interest rates rise 
bancorp s primary strategy to control interest rate risk is to sell substantially all long term fixed rate loans in the secondary market 
to further control interest rate risk related to its loan servicing portfolio  bancorp originates a substantial amount of construction loans that typically have terms of one year or less 
the turnover in construction loan portfolio assists bancorp in maintaining a reasonable level of interest rate risk 
quantitative information about market risk 
the primary market risk facing bancorp is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise prospective  bancorp manages this risk by striving to balance its loan origination activities with the interest rate market 
bancorp attempts to maintain a substantial portion of its loan portfolio in short term loans such as construction loans 
this has proven to be an effective hedge against rapid increases in interest rates as the construction loan portfolio reprices rapidly 
the matching of maturity or repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which these assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an interest earning asset or interest bearing liability is interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities represents the bank s interest sensitivity gap 
exposure to interest rate risk is actively monitored by bancorp s management 
its objective is to maintain a consistent level of profitability within acceptable risk tolerances across a broad range of potential interest rate environments 
bancorp uses the ots net portfolio value npv model to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk  which calculates changes in npv 
the following table represents bancorp s npv at december  the npv was calculated by the ots  based upon information provided to the ots 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value npv net portfolio value npv as of pv of assets change in rates amount change change npv ratio change dollars are in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp the above table suggests that if interest rates rise bps  bancorp s interest sensitive assets would decline in value by
