these statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  and actual events or results may differ materially 
important factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the forward looking statements are disclosed throughout this report  particularly under the heading risk factors in item a of part i of this annual report 
you should review these risk factors for a more complete understanding of the risks associated with an investment in our securities 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a provider of communications networking equipment  software and services that support the transport  switching  aggregation and management of voice  video and data traffic 
our optical service delivery and carrier ethernet service delivery products are used individually  or as part of an integrated solution  in communications networks operated by communications service providers  cable operators  governments and enterprises around the globe 
we are a network specialist targeting the transition of disparate  legacy communications networks to converged  next generation architectures  better able to handle increased traffic and deliver more efficiently a broader mix of high bandwidth communications services 
our products  along with their embedded  network element software and unified service and transport management  enable service providers to efficiently and cost effectively deliver critical enterprise and consumer oriented communication services 
together with our professional support and consulting services  our product offerings seek to offer solutions that address the business challenges and network needs of our customers 
our customers face an increasingly challenging and rapidly changing environment that requires them to quickly adapt their business strategies and deliver new  revenue creating services 
by improving network productivity  reducing operating costs and providing the flexibility to enable new and integrated service offerings  our offerings create business and operational value for our customers 
effect of decline in market conditions our results of operations for fiscal described in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section reflect the weakness  volatility and uncertainty presented by the global market conditions that we encountered during the year 
our fiscal results reflect cautious spending among our largest customers during fiscal  as they sought to conserve capital  reduce debt or address uncertainties or changes in their own business models brought on by broader market challenges 
as a result  we experienced lower demand across our customer base in all geographies 
we also experienced lengthening sales cycles  customer delays in network build outs  slowing deployments and deferral of new technology adoption 
we have also experienced an increasingly competitive marketplace and a heightened customer focus on pricing and return on investment 
while we have started to see some indications that conditions in north america may be improving  we remain uncertain as to how long unfavorable macroeconomic and industry conditions will persist and the magnitude of their effects on our business and results of operations 
strategic initiatives despite difficult market conditions  we continue to believe in our longer term market opportunities and the potential represented by the underlying drivers of future demand for our hardware  software and services offerings in our target markets 
we believe consumer and enterprise use of  and increased dependence upon  a growing variety of broadband applications and services will continue to consume bandwidth  requiring our customers to invest in next generation network infrastructures that are more efficient and robust  and better able to handle higher capacity multiservice traffic and increased transmission rates 
as a result  we continued to strategically invest in our business during fiscal  prioritizing spending on key product and technology initiatives that we believe will strategically position us for longer term growth when market conditions recover 
in fact  research and development expense increased year over year despite the significant reduction in revenue during fiscal and the restructuring activities described below 
we expect to continue to invest significantly in research and development 
specifically  our ongoing development is focused upon bringing several new platforms to market during fiscal and our broader development investments are focused upon data optimized switching solutions and evolution of our coredirector family and family of reconfigurable switching solutions  extending and increasing capacity of our converged optical transport service delivery portfolio  including g transport technologies and capabilities  expanding our carrier ethernet service delivery portfolio  including larger ethernet aggregation switches  and extending the value of our network management software platform across our product portfolio 
these broader development initiatives remain focused on delivering upon our vision of transforming customer networks to adapt and scale  manage unpredictability and eliminate barriers to new service offerings 
this vision of simplified  highly automated networks is based on the following technologies programmable network elements  including software programmable hardware platforms and interfaces that use our flexiport technology  to enable on demand and automated support for multiple services and applications  common service aware operating system and unified transport and service management software for an integrated solution ensuring all network elements work seamlessly together for rapid delivery of services and applications  and optimized carrier ethernet technology our true carrier ethernet for enhanced management  faster provisioning  higher reliability and support for a wider variety of services 
through these capabilities  we seek to enable customers to automate delivery and management of a broad mix of services over networks that offer enhanced flexibility and are more cost effective to deploy  scale and manage 
pending acquisition of nortel metro ethernet networks men assets we believe that our pending acquisition of substantially all of the optical networking and carrier ethernet assets of nortel s men business will accelerate the execution of our corporate and research and development strategy  and will create a leader in next generation  automated optical ethernet networks 
following our emergence as the winning bidder in the bankruptcy auction  we agreed to acquire substantially all of the optical networking and carrier ethernet assets of nortel s men business for million in cash and million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due june the terms of the notes to be issued upon closing are set forth in note of the consolidated financial statements found under item of part ii of this annual report 
nortel s product and technology assets to be acquired include long haul optical transport portfolio  metro optical ethernet switching and transport solutions  ethernet transport  aggregation and switching technology  multiservice sonet sdh product families  and network management software products 
in addition to these products  the acquired operations also include network implementation and support services 
the assets to be acquired generated approximately billion in revenue for nortel in fiscal and approximately million unaudited in the first six months of nortel s fiscal the pending acquisition encompasses a business that is a leading provider of next generation  g and g optical transport technology with a significant  global installed base 
the acquired transport technology allows network operators to upgrade their existing g networks to g capability  quadrupling capacity without the need for new fiber deployments or complex network re engineering 
in addition to transport capability  the optical platforms acquired include traffic switching and aggregation capability for traditional protocols such as sonet sdh as well as newer packet protocols such as ethernet 
a suite of software products used to manage networks built from these technologies is also part of the transaction 
we believe that the transaction provides an opportunity to significantly transform ciena and strengthen our position as a leader in next generation  automated optical ethernet networking 
we believe that the additional resources  expanded geographic reach  new and broader customer relationships  and deeper portfolio of complementary network solutions derived from the transaction will augment ciena s growth 
we also expect that the transaction will add scale  enable operating model synergies and provide an opportunity to optimize our research and development investment 
we expect these benefits of the transaction will help ciena to better compete with traditional  larger network vendors 
we expect to make employment offers to at least  nortel employees to become part of ciena s global team of network specialists 
the transaction will significantly enhance our existing canadian based development resources  making ottawa our largest product and development center 
given the structure of the transaction as an asset carve out from nortel  we expect that the transaction will result in a costly and complex integration with a number of operational risks 
we expect to incur integration related costs of approximately million  with the majority of these costs to be incurred in the first months following the completion of the transaction 
this estimate principally reflects expense associated with equipment and information technology costs  transaction expense  and consulting and third party service fees associated with integration 
this amount does not give effect to any expense related to  among other things  facilities restructuring or inventory obsolescence charges 
as a result  the integration expense we incur and recognize for financial statement purposes could be significantly higher 
any material delays or unanticipated additional expense may harm our business and results of operations 
in addition to these integration costs  we also expect to incur significant transition services expense  and we will rely upon an affiliate of nortel to perform certain operational functions during an interim period following closing not to exceed two years 
we expect this pending transaction to close in the first calendar quarter of if the closing does not take place on or before april   the applicable asset sale agreements may be terminated by either party 
ciena has been granted early termination of the antitrust waiting periods under the hart scott rodino act and the canadian competition act 
on december   the bankruptcy courts in the us and canada approved the asset sale agreement relating to ciena s acquisition of substantially all of the north american  caribbean and latin american and asian optical networking and carrier ethernet assets of nortel s men business 
completion of the transaction remains subject to information and consultation with employee representatives and employees in certain international jurisdictions  an additional regional regulatory clearance and customary closing conditions 
as a result of the aggregate consideration to be paid as described above  we will incur significant additional indebtedness and will materially reduce our existing cash balance 
except where specifically indicated  the discussion in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations does not give effect to the possible consummation of this pending transaction and the effect on our results of operations 
goodwill impairment based on a combination of factors  including the macroeconomic conditions described above and a sustained decline in our common stock price and market capitalization below our net book value  we conducted an interim impairment assessment of goodwill during the second quarter of fiscal the conclusion of this assessment was the write off of all goodwill remaining on our balance sheet  resulting in an impairment charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal this impairment charge significantly affected our operating expense and operating and net loss for fiscal it will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below for more information regarding this assessment 
restructuring activities during the second quarter of fiscal  we took action to effect a headcount reduction of approximately employees or of our global workforce  with headcount reductions implemented across our organizations and geographies 
as part of this action  we closed our acton  massachusetts research and development facility during the third quarter 
we expect these steps will help better align our operating expense with market opportunities and the development strategy above 
we incurred an million charge in fiscal  principally consisting of million for employee related restructuring  million for acton facilities related restructuring  and million related to the revision of previous estimates 
financial results revenue for the fourth quarter was million  which represented a sequential increase of from million in the third quarter of fiscal and a decrease from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the sequential quarterly increase in revenue reflects a million increase in carrier ethernet service delivery revenue  principally related to sales of carrier ethernet switching and aggregation products in support of wireless backhaul deployments  including  in large part  g wimax 
revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal also benefited from a million increase in optical service delivery revenue  primarily reflecting increased sales of cn  and a million increase in service revenue 
in spite of slight improvements in revenue in the second half of fiscal  and improved sales of carrier ethernet switching and aggregation products during fiscal  the unfavorable market conditions and reductions in customer spending described above resulted in significant declines in annual revenue as compared to fiscal total revenue decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal revenue reflects a million decrease in sales of our optical service delivery products  revenue from the us for fiscal was million  a decrease from million in fiscal  international revenue for fiscal was million  a decrease from million in fiscal  as a percentage of revenue  international revenue was during the fiscal  a slight increase from in fiscal  and for fiscal  one customer at t representing of revenue accounted for greater than of revenue 
this compares to  when two customers at t representing  and bt representing of revenue accounted for greater than of our revenue 
gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  down from in the third quarter of fiscal gross margin for fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal product gross margin was in fiscal  a decrease from in fiscal gross margin decreases during fiscal reflect the effect of increased competition  including increased pricing pressure across our optical transport products  and less favorable product and geographic mix  including fewer sales of core switching products as a percentage of total revenue 
gross margin for fiscal was also negatively affected by increased charges related to losses on committed customer sales contracts and higher charges relating to warranty 
these additional costs of goods sold were partially offset by product cost reductions 
operating expense for fiscal was million  which includes a goodwill impairment charge of million  compared to million in fiscal annual operating expense related to research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative decreased by million in fiscal this decrease reflects our efforts to manage our workforce and constrain general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses in the face of weaker market conditions 
exclusive of the goodwill impairment  we expect operating expense to increase from fiscal  particularly if market conditions improve and we seek to fund and support the growth of our business 
our loss from operations for fiscal was million 
this compares to income from operations of million in fiscal our net loss for fiscal was million  or per share 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal net loss and operating loss reflect the effect of market conditions and lower customer spending during fiscal and a goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of fiscal  each as described above 
we generated million in cash from operations during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal cash from operations during fiscal consisted of million in cash from net income adjusted for non cash charges and million resulting from changes in working capital 
cash from operations during fiscal consisted of million in cash from net income adjusted for non cash charges and a million net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital 
at october   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term and long term investments in marketable debt securities 
as of october   headcount was  a decrease from  at october  and an increase from  at october  results of operations our results of operations for fiscal include the operations of world wide packets wwp only after the march  acquisition date 
revenue we derive revenue from sales of our products and services  which we discuss in the following three major groupings optical service delivery 
included in product revenue  this revenue grouping reflects sales of our transport and switching products and legacy data networking products and related software 
this revenue grouping was previously referred to as our converged ethernet infrastructure products 
carrier ethernet service delivery 
included in product revenue  this revenue grouping reflects sales of our service delivery and aggregation switches  broadband access products  and the related software 
global network services 
included in services revenue are sales of installation  deployment  maintenance support  consulting and training activities 
a sizable portion of our revenue continues to come from sales to a small number of communications service providers 
as a result  our revenues are closely tied to the prospects  performance  and financial condition of our largest customers and are significantly affected by market wide changes  including reductions in enterprise and consumer spending  that affect the businesses and level of infrastructure related spending by communications service providers 
our contracts do not have terms that obligate these customers to purchase any minimum or specific amounts of equipment or services 
because their spending may be unpredictable and sporadic  and their purchases may result in the recognition or deferral of significant amounts of revenue in a given quarter  our revenue can fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
our concentration of revenue increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in revenue and operating results and can exacerbate our exposure to reductions in spending or changes in network strategy involving one or more of our significant customers 
in particular  some of our customers are pursuing efforts to outsource the management and operation of their networks  or have indicated a procurement strategy to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase equipment 
given current market conditions and the effect of lower demand in fiscal  as well as changes in the mix of our revenue toward products with shorter customer lead times  the percentage of our quarterly revenue relating to orders placed in that quarter has increased in comparison to prior periods 
lower levels of backlog orders and an increase in the percentage of quarterly revenue relating to orders placed in that quarter could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarterly results 
cost of goods sold product cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers  component costs  direct compensation costs and overhead  shipping and logistics costs associated with manufacturing related operations  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees  amortization of intangible assets  cost of excess and obsolete inventory and  when applicable  estimated losses on committed customer contracts 
services cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct and third party costs  including personnel costs  associated with provision of services including installation  deployment  maintenance support  consulting and training activities  and  when applicable  estimated losses on committed customer contracts 
gross margin gross margin continues to be susceptible to quarterly fluctuation due to a number of factors 
product gross margin can vary significantly depending upon the mix of products and customers in a given fiscal quarter 
gross margin can also be affected by volume of orders  our ability to drive product cost reductions  geographic mix  the level of pricing pressure we encounter  our introduction of new products or entry into new markets  charges for excess and obsolete inventory and changes in warranty costs 
service gross margin can be affected by the mix of customers and services  particularly the mix between deployment and maintenance services  geographic mix and the timing and extent of any investments in internal resources to support this business 
operating expense research and development expense primarily consists of salaries and related employee expense including share based compensation expense  prototype costs relating to design  development  testing of our products  and third party consulting costs 
sales and marketing expense primarily consists of salaries  commissions and related employee expense including share based compensation expense  and sales and marketing support expense  including travel  demonstration units  trade show expense  and third party consulting costs 
general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and related employee expense including share based compensation expense  and costs for third party consulting and other services 
amortization of intangible assets primarily reflects purchased technology and customer relationships from our acquisitions

the resulting million net change reflects decreases of million in employee compensation cost  million in consulting services expense  million in facilities and information systems expense  and million in technology related expense 
expense for fiscal included million associated with the settlement of patent litigation 
amortization of intangible assets costs decreased due to certain intangible assets reaching the end of their useful life and becoming fully amortized during fiscal restructuring costs during fiscal was primarily related to a headcount reduction of approximately employees  the closure of our acton  massachusetts research and development facility and revisions of estimates related to previously restructured facilities 
restructuring costs for fiscal principally reflects costs associated with a workforce reduction of employees during the fourth quarter 
goodwill impairment was based on a combination of factors  including the macroeconomic conditions described above and a sustained decline in our common stock price and market capitalization below our net book value 
these factors required ciena to conduct an interim impairment assessment of goodwill during the second quarter of fiscal the conclusion of this assessment was the write off of all goodwill remaining on our balance sheet  resulting in an impairment charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal other items the table below in thousands  except percentage data sets forth the changes in other items for the periods indicated fiscal year increase decrease interest and other income  net interest expense realized loss due to impairment of marketable debt investments loss on cost method investments gain on extinguishment of debt provision benefit for income taxes denotes of total revenue denotes change from to interest and other income  net decreased due to lower average cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
lower cash balances primarily relate to the repayment at maturity of the million principal outstanding on our convertible notes during the first quarter of fiscal and our use of million in cash consideration and related expenses associated with our acquisition of wwp in the second quarter of fiscal interest expense decreased primarily due to the repayment of convertible notes at maturity at the end of the first quarter of fiscal realized loss due to impairment of marketable debt investments for fiscal reflects a loss related to commercial paper investments in siv portfolio plc formerly known as cheyne finance plc and rhinebridge llc  two structured investment vehicles sivs that entered into receivership during the fourth quarter of fiscal and failed to make payment at maturity 
these sivs completed their restructuring activities during fiscal and  as of the end of the fiscal year  we no longer held these investments 
loss on cost method investments during fiscal was due to the decline in value of our investments in two privately held technology companies that were determined to be other than temporary 
gain on extinguishment of debt reflects our repurchase of million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes due may  in an open market transaction 
we used million of our cash to effect this repurchase  which resulted in a gain of approximately million 
provision for income taxes decreased primarily due to refundable federal tax credits made available by recent economic stimulus tax law changes 
availability of refundable credits currently expires on december  we will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against nearly all net deferred tax assets until sufficient evidence exists to support a reversal 
see critical accounting policies and estimates deferred tax valuation allowance below for information relating to our deferred tax valuation allowance and the conditions required for its release

increased optical service delivery revenue reflects increases of million in sales of cn and million in sales of core switching products 
these increases were offset by decreases of million in sales of core transport products and million in sales of legacy data networking and metro transport products 
we believe that our optical service delivery revenue during fiscal benefited from increasing network capacity requirements and customer transition to more efficient and economical network architectures 
in particular  sales of our core switching products benefited from an expansion in mesh style optical networks 
revenue from our carrier ethernet service delivery products increased by million  reflecting the addition of million in sales related to service delivery and aggregation switches from our acquisition of wwp 
this increase offset a million reduction in revenue from our broadband access products

this increase offset a million reduction in revenue from our broadband access products 
in addition  us revenue benefited from a million increase in services revenue 
international revenue increased primarily due to a million increase in sales of our optical service delivery products 
this primarily reflects increases of million in sales of core switching products  million in sales of cn and million in sales of core transport products 
international revenue also benefited from a million increase in carrier ethernet service delivery revenue and a million increase in services revenue 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased due to significant improvements in services gross margin  product cost reductions and favorable product mix 
gross profit on products as a percentage of product revenue increased primarily due to significant product cost reductions and improved manufacturing efficiencies as a result of consolidation efforts relating to our supply chain and our increased use of lower cost contract manufacturers and suppliers in asia 
improved gross margin also benefited from a favorable product mix 
this improvement was partially offset by the effect on product costs of goods sold of million in costs related to the revaluation of the acquired wwp inventory 
gross profit on services as a percentage of services revenue increased significantly due to improved deployment efficiencies

we used million of our cash to effect this repurchase  which resulted in a gain of approximately million 
gain on equity investments  net during fiscal was related to a final payment from the sale of a privately held technology company in which we held a minority equity investment 
provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to foreign tax related to our foreign operations and recognition of domestic deferred tax assets from prior acquisitions 
federal tax is largely offset  except for any alternative minimum tax  by recognizing deferred tax assets that were previously reserved against by a valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources at october   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we reallocated our previous short and long term investments principally into us treasuries 
as a result  at october   short term and long term investments principally represent us treasuries 
the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in thousands october  increase decrease cash and cash equivalents short term investments in marketable debt securities long term investments in marketable debt securities total cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities the decrease in total cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities during fiscal was primarily related to the purchase of capital assets  slightly offset by cash generated from operating activities described in operating activities below 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable debt securities and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  payment of the cash consideration for our pending acquisition of nortel s men assets  acquisition related costs  integration costs  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next months

these costs are variable and are not expected to have a material impact 
purchase obligations relate to purchase order commitments to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for inventory 
in certain instances  we are permitted to cancel  reschedule or adjust these orders 
consequently  only a portion of the amount reported above relates to firm  non cancelable and unconditional obligations 
as of october   we had approximately million of other long term obligations in our consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions that are not included in this table because the periods of cash settlement with the respective tax authority cannot be reasonably estimated 
some of our commercial commitments  including some of the future minimum payments set forth above  are secured by standby letters of credit 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments secured by standby letters of credit by commitment expiration date as of october  in thousands less than one one to three to total year three years five years thereafter standby letters of credit off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any equity interests in so called limited purpose entities  which include special purpose entities spes and structured finance entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect those areas where significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
customer purchase agreements and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue for maintenance services is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
some of our communications networking equipment is integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
software revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables  including any combination of equipment  services and software 
if multiple element arrangements include software or software related elements that are essential to the equipment  we allocate the arrangement fee to those separate units of accounting 
multiple element arrangements that include software are separated into more than one unit of accounting if the functionality of the delivered element s is not dependent on the undelivered element s  there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element s  and general revenue recognition criteria related to the delivered element s have been met 
the amount of product and services revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
for all other deliverables  we separate the elements into more than one unit of accounting if the delivered element s have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered element s  and delivery of the undelivered element s is probable and substantially within our control 
revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each accounting unit or using the residual method if objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered element s 
the revenue recognition criteria described above are applied to each separate unit of accounting 
if these criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until the criteria are met or the last element has been delivered 
our total deferred revenue for products was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
our total deferred revenue for services was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for share based awards based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option based award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires that we make several estimates  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
because we considered our options to be plain vanilla  we calculated the expected term using the simplified method for fiscal options are considered to be plain vanilla if they have the following basic characteristics they are granted at the money  exercisability is conditioned upon service through the vesting date  termination of service prior to vesting results in forfeiture  there is a limited exercise period following termination of service  and the options are non transferable and non hedgeable 
beginning in fiscal we gathered more detailed historical information about specific exercise behavior of our grantees  which we used to determine expected term 
we considered the implied volatility and historical volatility of our stock price in determining our expected volatility  and  finding both to be equally reliable  determined that a combination of both measures would result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
we recognize the estimated fair value of option based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and or performance based vesting conditions 
we recognize the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense ratably over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain financial or other performance criteria or targets as a condition to the vesting  or acceleration of vesting 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense over the performance period  using graded vesting  which considers each performance period or tranche separately  based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets 
revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal  and  to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense takes into account estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our assumptions related to share based compensation and the amount of share based compensation expense we incurred for the periods covered in this report 
as of october   total unrecognized compensation expense was i million  which relates to unvested stock options and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of year  and ii million  which relates to unvested restricted stock units and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock units directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law with and without method 
under the with and without method  the windfall is considered realized and recognized for financial statement purposes only when an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax benefits including our net operating losses 
the with and without method results in the windfall from share based compensation awards always being effectively the last tax benefit to be considered 
consequently  the windfall attributable to share based compensation will not be considered realized in instances where our net operating loss carryover that is unrelated to windfalls is sufficient to offset the current year s taxable income before considering the effects of current year windfalls 
reserve for inventory obsolescence we make estimates about future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete or unmarketable by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory write downs are a component of our product cost of goods sold 
upon recognition of the write down  a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these charges were primarily related to excess inventory due to a change in forecasted product sales 
in an effort to limit our exposure to delivery delays and to satisfy customer needs we purchase inventory based on forecasted sales across our product lines 
in addition  part of our research and development strategy is to promote the convergence of similar features and functionalities across our product lines 
each of these practices exposes us to the risk that our customers will not order products for which we have forecasted sales  or will purchase less than we have forecasted 
historically  we have experienced write downs due to changes in strategic direction  discontinuance of a product and declines in market conditions 
if actual market conditions worsen or differ from those we have assumed  if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there is a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence due to a rapid change in technology  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
our inventory net of allowance for excess and obsolete was million and as of october  and october   respectively 
restructuring as part of our restructuring costs  we provide for the estimated cost of the net lease expense for facilities that are no longer being used 
the provision is equal to the fair value of the minimum future lease payments under our contracted lease obligations  offset by the fair value of the estimated sublease payments that we may receive 
as of october   our accrued restructuring liability related to net lease expense and other related charges was million 
the total minimum lease payments for these restructured facilities are million 
these lease payments will be made over the remaining lives of our leases  which range from sixteen months to ten years 
if actual market conditions are different than those we have projected  we will be required to recognize additional restructuring costs or benefits associated with these facilities 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on management s assessment  on a specific identification basis  of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally have not required collateral or other forms of security from customers 
in determining the appropriate balance for our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  management considers each individual customer account receivable in order to determine collectibility 
in doing so  we consider creditworthiness  payment history  account activity and communication with such customer 
if a customer s financial condition changes  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to take a charge for an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was million and as of october  and october   respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as of october  and october  was million 
goodwill as discussed in overview above  during the second quarter of fiscal  we conducted an interim impairment assessment that resulted in the write off of all goodwill remaining on our balance sheet 
as a result  as of october  and october   our consolidated balance sheet included million and in goodwill  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over amounts assigned to tangible or identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from our acquisitions 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  which we have determined to be the last business day of fiscal september each year 
we also test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
a non cash goodwill impairment charge would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period 
if we are required to take a substantial impairment charge  our operating results would be materially adversely affected in such period 
we determine the fair value of our single reporting unit to be equal to our market capitalization plus a control premium 
market capitalization is determined by multiplying the shares outstanding on the assessment date by the average market price of our common stock over a day period before and a day period after each assessment date 
we use this day duration to consider inherent market fluctuations that may affect any individual closing price 
we believe that our market capitalization alone does not fully capture the fair value of our business as a whole  or the substantial value that an acquirer would obtain from its ability to obtain control of our business 
as such  in determining fair value  we add a control premium which seeks to give effect to the increased consideration a potential acquirer would be required to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to set policies  direct operations and make decisions related to our company to our market capitalization 
interim impairment assessment fiscal based on a combination of factors  including the macroeconomic conditions described above and a sustained decline in our common stock price and market capitalization below our net book value  we conducted an interim impairment assessment of goodwill during the second quarter of fiscal when we performed the step one fair value comparison during the second quarter of fiscal  our market capitalization was million and our carrying value  including goodwill  was million 
we applied a control premium to market capitalization to determine a fair value of million 
because step one indicated that the fair value was less than our carrying value  we performed the step two analysis 
under the step two analysis  the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of a reporting unit s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent of the difference 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill was determined to be  and  as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million  representing the full carrying value of the goodwill 
long lived assets excluding goodwill our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  include equipment  furniture and fixtures  finite lived intangible assets  and maintenance spares 
as of october  and these assets totaled million and million  net  respectively 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
our long lived assets are part of a single reporting unit which represents the lowest level for which we identify cash flows 
due to effects on our business of difficult macroeconomic conditions  during fiscal we experienced order delays  lengthening sales cycles and slowing deployments 
as a result of these conditions  we performed an impairment analysis of all our long lived assets during the second quarter of fiscal valuation of our long lived assets requires us to make assumptions about future sales prices and sales volumes for our products that involve new technologies and uncertainties around customer acceptance of new products 
these and other assumptions are used to forecast future  undiscounted cash flows 
based on our estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows as of april   no impairment was required 
if actual market conditions differ or our forecasts change  we may be required to record a non cash impairment charge related to long lived assets in future periods 
such charges would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period 
investments we have an investment portfolio comprised of marketable debt securities which are comprised of us government obligations 
the value of these securities is subject to market volatility for the period we hold these investments and until their sale or maturity 
we recognize losses when we determine that declines in the fair value of our investments  below their cost basis  are other than temporary 
in determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including market price when available  investment ratings  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we make significant judgments in considering these factors 
if we judge that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the investment is valued at the current fair value  and we would incur a loss equal to the decline  which could materially adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 
as of october   we held a minority investment of million in a privately held technology company that is reported in other assets 
the market for technologies or products manufactured by this company is in the early stage and markets may never materialize or become significant 
this investment is inherently high risk and we could lose our entire investment 
we monitor this investment for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when necessary 
if market conditions  the expected financial performance  or the competitive position of this company deteriorates  we may be required to record a non cash charge in future periods due to an impairment of the value of our investment 
during fiscal  we recorded losses of million related to a decline in value  determined to be other than temporary  associated with two of our investments in privately held technology companies 
one of the privately held companies was purchased by a publicly traded entity 
as a result  this investment is now recorded as a trading security 
deferred tax valuation allowance as of october   we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting nearly all our net deferred tax assets of billion 
when measuring the need for a valuation allowance  we assess both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly and is maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal 
because evidence such as our operating results during the most recent three year period is afforded more weight than forecasted results for future periods  our cumulative loss during this three year period represents sufficient negative evidence regarding the need for nearly a full valuation allowance 
we will release this valuation allowance when management determines that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
any future release of valuation allowance may be recorded as a tax benefit increasing net income or as an adjustment to paid in capital  based on tax ordering requirements 
uncertain tax positions ciena accounts for uncertainty in income tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
as of october   we had million and million recorded as current and long term obligations  respectively  related to uncertain tax positions 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
warranty our liability for product warranties  included in other accrued liabilities  was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to five years 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of goods sold based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs  and associated overhead 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
the provision for product warranties was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the provision for warranty claims may fluctuate on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of products and customers in that period 
if actual product failure rates  material replacement costs  service or labor costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required 
an increase in warranty claims or the related costs associated with satisfying these warranty obligations could increase our cost of sales and negatively affect our gross margin 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business 
these may relate to disputes  litigation and other legal actions 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
a loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether any accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain a short term and long term investment portfolio 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information relating to these investments and their fair value 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percentage points from current levels  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material 
our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange risk are related to non us dollar denominated operating expense in canadian dollars cad  british pounds gbp  euros eur and indian rupees inr 
during fiscal  approximately of our operating expense  exclusive of our goodwill impairment and restructuring costs  was us dollar denominated 
to reduce variability in non us dollar denominated operating expense  we have previously entered into foreign currency forward contracts and may do so in the future 
we utilize these derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and typically have maturities of less than one year 
ciena s foreign currency forward contracts were fully matured as of october  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss was initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and  upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  was subsequently reclassified into the operating expense line item to which the hedged transaction related 
we recorded the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments in interest and other income  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
favorable foreign exchange translations  net of hedging  benefited total research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses by approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal this favorable foreign exchange translation was due to the relative strength of the us dollar in relation to the previous year 
these foreign currency forward contracts were not designed to provide foreign currency protection over the long term 
in designing a specific approach  we considered several factors  including offsetting exposures  significance of exposures  costs associated with entering into a particular instrument  and potential effectiveness 
as of october   there were no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts 
as of october   our assets and liabilities related to non dollar denominated currencies were primarily related to intercompany payables and receivables 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative or trading purposes
