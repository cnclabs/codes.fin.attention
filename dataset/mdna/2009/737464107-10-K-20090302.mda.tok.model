as of february  as of february   represents the total number of units under contract for sale upon completion and delivery of the units 
there can be no assurance that condominium units under contract will close 
the amounts reflected for this project represent the condominium portion of a mixed use development currently being developed in an entity owned with other third party developers 
the condominium portion of the project is owned through a joint venture with an atlanta based condominium development partner and is branded as the ritz carlton residences  atlanta  buckhead 
competition all of the company s apartment and for sale condominium communities are located in developed markets that include other upscale apartments and for sale condominium projects owned by numerous public and private companies 
some of these companies may have substantially greater resources and greater access to capital than the company  allowing them to grow at rates greater than the company 
the number of competitive upscale apartment and for sale condominium properties and companies in a particular market could have a material effect on the company s ability to lease apartment units at its apartment communities  including any newly developed or acquired communities  and on the rents charged  and could have a material effect on the company s ability to sell for sale condominium units and on the selling prices of such units 
in addition  other forms of residential properties  including single family housing and town homes  provide housing alternatives to potential residents of upscale apartment communities or potential purchasers of for sale condominium units 
the company competes for residents in its apartment communities based on its high level of resident service  the quality of its apartment communities including its landscaping and amenity offerings and the desirability of its locations 
resident leases at its apartment communities are priced competitively based on market conditions  supply and demand characteristics  and the quality and resident service offerings of its communities 
the company does not seek to compete on the basis of providing the low cost solution for all residents 
americans with disabilities act and fair housing act the company s multi family housing communities and any newly acquired multi family housing communities must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act the ada to the extent that such properties are public accommodations and or commercial facilities as defined by the ada 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of the company s multi family housing communities where such removal is readily achievable 
the ada does not  however  consider residential properties  such as multi family housing communities  to be public accommodations or commercial facilities  except to the extent portions of such facilities  such as the leasing office  are open to the public 
the company must also comply with the fair housing act the fha  which requires that apartment communities first occupied after march  be accessible to persons with disabilities 
noncompliance with the fha and ada could result in the imposition of fines  awards of damages to private litigants  payment of attorneys fees and other costs to plaintiffs  substantial litigation costs and substantial costs of remediation 
compliance with the fha could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in a community  including the interiors of multi family housing units covered under the fha 
in addition to the ada and fha  state and local laws exist that impact the company s multi family housing communities with respect to access thereto by persons with disabilities 
further  legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose additional burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by persons with disabilities 
the ada  fha  or other existing or new legislation may require the company to modify its existing properties 
these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings or may require the company to add other structural features that increase its construction costs 
within the past two years  there has been heightened scrutiny of multi family housing communities for compliance with the requirements of the fha and ada 
in november  the equal rights center  or erc  filed a lawsuit against the company and the operating partnership alleging various violations of the fha and the ada at certain properties designed  constructed or operated by the company and the operating partnership 
the erc seeks compensatory and punitive damages  an award of attorneys fees and costs of suit  as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief that includes retrofitting multi family housing units and public use areas to comply with the fha and ada and prohibiting construction or sale of noncompliant units or complexes 
at this stage in the proceeding  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal proceeding  nor is it possible to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that would be associated with an adverse decision 
the company cannot ascertain the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada  fha or other similar state and local legislation and such costs are post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp

the cost associated with ongoing litigation or compliance could be substantial and could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
environmental regulations the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations that apply to the development of real property  including construction activities  the ownership of real property  and the operation of multi family apartment and for sale condominium communities 
the company has instituted a policy that requires an environmental investigation of each property that it considers for purchase or that it owns and plans to develop 
the environmental investigation is conducted by a qualified third party environmental consultant in accordance with recognized industry standards 
the environmental investigation report is reviewed by the company and counsel prior to purchase and or development of any property 
if the environmental investigation identifies evidence of potentially significant environmental contamination that merits additional investigation  sampling of the property is performed by the environmental consultant 
if necessary  remediation or mitigation of contamination  including removal of contaminated soil and or underground storage tanks  placement of impervious barriers  or creation of land use or deed restrictions  is undertaken either prior to development or at another appropriate time 
when performing remediation activities  the company is subject to a variety of environmental requirements 
in some cases  the company obtains state approval of the selected remediation and mitigation measures by entering into voluntary environmental cleanup programs administered by state agencies 
in developing properties and constructing apartment and for sale condominium communities  the company utilizes independent environmental consultants to determine whether there are any flood plains  wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas that are part of the property to be developed 
if flood plains are identified  development and construction work is planned so that flood plain areas are preserved or alternative flood plain capacity is created in conformance with federal and local flood plain management requirements 
if wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas are identified  the company plans and conducts its development and construction activities and obtains the necessary permits and authorizations in compliance with applicable legal standards 
in some cases  however  the presence of wetlands and or other environmentally sensitive areas could preclude  severely limit  or otherwise alter the proposed site development and construction activities 
storm water discharge from a construction site is subject to the storm water permit requirements mandated under the clean water act 
in most jurisdictions  the state administers the permit programs 
the company currently anticipates that it will be able to obtain and materially comply with any storm water permits required for new development 
the company has obtained and is in material compliance with the construction site storm water permits required for its existing development activities 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla and comparable state laws subject the owner or operator of real property or a facility and persons who arranged for off site disposal activities to claims or liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances that are released at  in  on  under  or from real property or a facility 
in addition to claims for cleanup costs  the presence of hazardous substances on or the release of hazardous substances from a property or a facility could result in a claim by a private party for personal injury or property damage or could result in a claim from a governmental agency for other damages  including natural resource damages 
liability under cercla and comparable state laws can be imposed on the owner or the operator of real property or a facility without regard to fault or even knowledge of the release of hazardous substances and other regulated materials on  at  in  under  or from the property or facility 
environmental liabilities associated with hazardous substances also could be imposed on the company under other applicable environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state laws  or common law principles 
the presence of hazardous substances in amounts requiring response action or the failure to undertake necessary remediation may adversely affect the owner s ability to use or sell real estate or borrow money using such real estate as collateral 
various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the company s ongoing operation of its communities 
such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos containing materials in buildings  management of surfaces with lead based paint and notices to residents about the lead based paint  use of active underground petroleum storage tanks  and waste management activities 
the failure to comply with such requirements could subject the company to a government enforcement action and or claims for damages by a private party

index to financial statements the company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any material noncompliance  claim  or liability in connection with environmental conditions associated with any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities 
the company has not been notified of a material claim for personal injury or property damage by a private party relating to any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities in connection with environmental conditions 
the company is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities that could be considered to be material 
it is possible  however  that the environmental investigations of the company s properties might not have revealed all potential environmental liabilities associated with the company s real property and its apartment and for sale condominium communities or the company might have underestimated any potential environmental issues identified in the investigations 
it is also possible that future environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations or new interpretations of existing environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations will impose material environmental liabilities on the company  the current environmental conditions of properties that the company owns or operates will be affected adversely by hazardous substances associated with other nearby properties or the actions of third parties unrelated to the company  or our residents and or commercial tenants may engage in activities prohibited by their leases or otherwise expose the company to liability under applicable environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations 
the costs of defending any future environmental claims  performing any future environmental remediation  satisfying any such environmental liabilities  or responding to any changed environmental conditions could materially adversely affect the company s financial conditions and results of operations

risk factors dollars in thousands  except per share amounts the following risk factors apply to the company and the operating partnership 
all indebtedness described in the risk factors has been incurred by the operating partnership 
the economic slowdown in the us and the decline in the condominium and single family housing markets have affected and may continue to affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there has been a significant decline in economic growth  both in the us and globally  in the second half of and beginning of the trends in both the real estate development industry and the us economy continue to be unfavorable 
these trends affect the company s revenues from its apartment communities 
the company s apartment communities compete with more affordable apartments in most markets 
the company s ability to lease its units in these communities at favorable rates  or at all is dependent upon the overall level of spending  which is affected by  among other things  employment levels  recession  personal debt levels  the recent slowdown in the housing market  stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future 
the company may be disproportionately vulnerable to reduced spending arising from this overall downturn as compared to owners of lower cost apartment communities 
the rental of excess for sale condominiums and single family homes in an already competitive multi family market may also reduce the company s ability to lease its apartment units and depress rental rates in certain markets 
the excess in for sale condominiums in the company s markets also affects the company s profits in its for sale condominium business 
the market for the company s for sale condominium homes depends on an active demand for new for sale housing and high consumer confidence 
continuing decline in demand  exacerbated by tighter credit standards for home buyers  has led to an oversupply of new for sale housing that affects the price at which the company is able to sell condominium homes and the number of condominium communities that the company is able to develop in the future 
the company cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain unfavorable  but if the markets continue to be weak or deteriorate further  the pace of condominium sales and closings will be slow during post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp

index to financial statements the credit crisis  global economic volatility and a recent rise in mortgage qualification requirements may affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the current instability and tightening in the credit markets has led to an increase in spreads and pricing of secured and unsecured debt 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit and declining real estate market have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy 
added concerns fueled by the federal government conservatorship of the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association  as well as other federal government interventions in the us credit markets and similar events in europe and other regions have led to increased uncertainty and instability in global capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have contributed to global economic and financial volatility of unprecedented levels 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease  to provide funding to borrowers 
continued volatility in the credit markets may negatively impact the company s ability to borrow and refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates or at all 
further  with respect to potential condominium home purchasers  there has been a decrease in the type of mortgage products available and a significant increase in the qualification requirements for new mortgages 
the difficulty that potential condominium home buyers may have obtaining financing may result in a significant decrease in demand for the company s condominium units  which may materially adversely affect the company s operations and financial results  and the duration and severity of the effects are uncertain 
the failure of banking and financial institutions may affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s access to funds under its revolving credit facility and other lines of credit depend on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to the company 
continuing long term disruptions in the global economy and the continuation of tighter credit conditions among  and potential failures of  third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions may have an adverse effect on the company s lenders 
if the company s lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to the company  the business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition of the company could be adversely affected 
in addition  the company may have cash and cash equivalents deposited in certain banking institutions that exceed federally insured limits 
a failure of any banking institution in which the company has funds on deposit may result in a loss of its deposits in excess of the federally insured limit 
the loss of such deposits would reduce cash available to fund operations and pay dividends 
there can be no assurance that the actions of the us government  the u 
s treasury  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets  or market response to those actions  will achieve the intended effect 
the company s business may not benefit from these actions  and further government or market developments could adversely impact the company 
in response to the financial issues affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  the emergency economic stabilization act of  or the eesa  was recently enacted 
the eesa provides the us secretary of treasury with the authority to establish a troubled asset relief program  or tarp  to purchase from financial institutions up to billion of residential or commercial mortgages and any securities  obligations  or other instruments that are based on  or related to  such mortgages  as well as other financial instruments 
in addition  the us secretary of treasury has the authority to establish a program to guarantee  upon request from a financial institution  the timely payment of principal and interest on these financial assets 
additionally  in response to the decline in economic growth in the us brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis and the resulting credit crunch  the american recovery and reinvestment act of  or the arra  was recently enacted 
the arra is intended to provide a stimulus to the us economy and includes federal tax cuts  expansion of unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions  and domestic spending in education  health care and infrastructure  including the energy sector

table of contents 
index to financial statements there can be no assurance that the eesa will have a beneficial impact on the financial markets  including current extreme levels of volatility  or that the arra will have a beneficial impact on economic growth 
to the extent the market does not respond favorably to this legislation or the programs do not function as intended  the company s business may not receive the anticipated positive impact from the legislation 
in addition  the us government  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis 
it is not possible to predict whether or when such actions may occur or what impact  if any  such actions could have on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
unfavorable changes in apartment markets and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates 
market and economic conditions in the various metropolitan areas of the united states where the company operates  particularly atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas  tampa  florida and the greater washington  dc area where a substantial majority of the company s apartment communities are located  may significantly affect occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore profitability 
the recent decline in economic growth may have a disproportionate impact on the company as discussed above 
in general  factors that may adversely affect market and economic conditions include the following the economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by a reduction in jobs  industry slowdowns and other factors  local conditions  such as oversupply of  or reduced demand for  apartment homes  declines in household formation  favorable residential mortgage rates  rent control or stabilization laws  or other laws regulating rental housing  which could prevent the company from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs  and competition from other available apartments and other housing alternatives and changes in market rental rates 
any of these factors would adversely affect the company s ability to achieve desired operating results from its communities 
development and construction risks could impact the company s profitability 
the company may develop and construct apartment communities and may convert existing apartment communities into condominiums or develop for sale condominium housing 
in response to deteriorating conditions in the global capital markets and the us economy  the company has recently deferred substantive activities on its pre development pipeline but currently intends to continue to develop its active pipeline of development projects under construction 
development activities may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties 
the company s development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks the company may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs  the company may incur construction costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs or unforeseen environmental conditions  which could make completion of the property uneconomical  and the company may not be able to increase rents or for sale condominium unit sales prices to compensate for the increase in construction costs  the company may abandon development opportunities that it has already begun to explore  and it may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring those opportunities  causing potential impairment losses to be incurred  the company has at times been and may continue to be unable to complete construction and lease up of a community on schedule and meet financial goals for development projects  because occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  the company may be unable to meet its profitability goals for that community  and land costs and construction costs have been volatile in the company s markets and may continue to be volatile in the future and  in some cases  the costs of upgrading acquired communities have  and may continue to  exceed original estimates and the company may be unable to charge rents  or sales prices with respect to for sale condominium product  that would compensate for these increases in costs

table of contents 
index to financial statements possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit the company s operational and financial flexibility 
purchasers may not be willing to pay acceptable prices for apartment communities that the company wishes to sell 
a weak market may limit the company s ability to change its portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions 
furthermore  general uncertainty in the real estate markets has resulted in conditions where the pricing of certain real estate assets may be difficult due to uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and valuations  among other things  which may add to the difficulty of potential buyers to obtain financing to acquire such properties on favorable terms or cause potential buyers to not complete acquisitions of such properties 
also  if the company is unable to sell apartment communities or if it can only sell apartment communities at prices lower than are generally acceptable  then the company may have to take on additional leverage in order to provide adequate capital to execute its development and construction and acquisitions strategy 
furthermore  a portion of the proceeds from the company s overall property sales in the future may be held in escrow accounts in order for some sales to qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  the company may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from property sales 
the company is subject to increased exposure to economic and other competitive factors due to the concentration of its investments in certain markets 
at december   approximately   and on a unit basis of the company s communities were located in the atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas  greater washington  dc and tampa  florida metropolitan areas  respectively 
the company has recently adopted a strategy of reducing its concentration in atlanta  georgia and dallas  texas and building critical mass in fewer markets 
the company is currently subject to increased exposure to economic and other competitive factors specific to its markets within these geographic areas 
failure to generate sufficient cash flows could affect the company s debt financing and create refinancing risk 
the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest 
although the company may be able to use cash flow generated by its apartment communities or through the sale of for sale condominium housing to make future principal payments  it may not have sufficient cash flow available to make all required principal payments and still meet the distribution requirements that the company must satisfy in order to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes 
the following factors  among others  may affect the cash flows generated by the company s apartment communities and through the sale of for sale condominium housing the national and local economies  local real estate market conditions  such as an oversupply of apartment homes or competing for sale condominium housing  the perceptions by prospective residents or buyers of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the company s communities and the neighborhoods in which they are located  the company s ability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance for its apartment communities  rental expenses for its apartment communities  including real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  and the level of mortgage interest rates and its impact on the demand for prospective buyers of for sale condominium housing 
expenses associated with the company s investment in apartment communities  such as debt service  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in cash flows from operations from that community 
if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and the company is unable to make the mortgage payments  the company could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgagor 
the company is likely to need to refinance at least a portion of its outstanding debt as it matures 
there is a risk that the company may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt 
as of december   the company had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of  of which  matures in and  that the company will prepay in march  senior unsecured debt of  none of which matures in and  that the company repurchased in february through a tender offer and unsecured line of credit borrowings of  post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the company could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increased risk of default and in an increase in its debt service requirements 
the company s stated goal is to generally maintain total effective leverage debt and preferred equity as a percentage of undepreciated real estate assets to not more than  to generally limit variable rate indebtedness as a percentage of total indebtedness to not more than of aggregate indebtedness  and to maintain adequate liquidity through the company s unsecured lines of credit 
at december   the company s total effective leverage debt and preferred equity as a percentage of undepreciated real estate assets and the company s total variable rate indebtedness as a percentage of total indebtedness were below these percentages 
if management adjusts the company s stated goal in the future  the company could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect funds from operations  adversely affect the company s ability to make expected distributions to its shareholders and the operating partnership s ability to make expected distributions to its limited partners and result in an increased risk of default on the obligations of the company and the operating partnership 
in addition  the company s ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in bank and other credit agreements and in the company s outstanding senior unsecured notes 
the company manages its debt to be in compliance with its stated policy and with its debt covenants  but the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company s ability to service the additional debt 
accordingly  the company could become more leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default of its debt covenants or on its debt obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements 
in addition  the company may continue to utilize secured debt financing to replace near term maturities of its senior unsecured notes  which could over time increase the company s ratio of secured debt to total assets and increase the risk of default of related covenants in its bank credit agreements and its senior unsecured notes 
any covenant breach or significant increase in the company s leverage could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 
a downgrade in the credit rating of the company s securities could materially adversely affect the company s business and financial condition 
the company s senior unsecured debt is rated investment grade by standard poor s corporation and moody s investors service 
in determining the company s credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors 
these factors include earnings  fixed charges such as interest  cash flows  total debt outstanding  total secured debt  off balance sheet obligations and other commitments  total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors 
there has been a limited market for primary issuances of unsecured debt securities for reits in recent months  and the pricing of these debt securities has been at significant spreads over treasury rates 
accordingly  the company and other multi family reits have pursued secured debt financing to replace near term maturities of unsecured debt securities 
to the extent primary issuances of unsecured debt securities continue not to be available at attractive rates and the company continues to replace unsecured debt with secured debt financing  the company s ratings could come under pressure 
the rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows  business strategy and diversity  industry conditions and contingencies 
therefore  deterioration in the company s operating performance could also cause the company s investment grade rating to come under pressure 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its credit ratings or that the company s credit ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn in their entirety 
a negative change in the company s ratings outlook or any downgrade in the company s current investment grade credit ratings by the company s rating agencies could adversely affect the company s cost and or access to sources of liquidity and capital 
additionally  such a downgrade could  among other things  significantly increase the costs of borrowing under the company s unsecured credit lines  adversely impact the company s ability to obtain unsecured debt or refinance its unsecured credit lines on competitive terms in the future  or require the company to take certain actions to support its obligations  any of which would adversely affect the company s business and financial condition 
debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to the company s shareholders 
the company s ability to execute its business strategy depends on its access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including common and preferred equity 
debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts  or on favorable terms or at all 
as discussed above  the current instability and tightening in the credit markets may negatively impact the company s ability to borrow and refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates or at all 
in addition  if the company issues additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt  the interests of existing shareholders could be diluted

index to financial statements the company may not be able to maintain its current dividend level 
the company s quarterly dividend payment rate to common shareholders had been per share for the first three quarters of the board of directors reduced the company s dividend payment rate to per share for the fourth quarter of to the extent the company continues to pay dividends at this reduced dividend rate  the company currently expects that net cash flows from operations reduced by annual operating capital expenditures for should generally fund the dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders excluding the expected cost of the water intrusion remediation project of approximately  in  although there can be no assurances that such operating cash flows will be sufficient in the near term 
the company would intend to use primarily line of credit borrowings and apartment community and condominium sales to fund any additional cash flow necessary to fully fund the dividend payments to common shareholders to the extent not funded by operating cash flows  as well as to fund the water intrusion remediation project 
the company s board of directors reviews the dividend quarterly  and there can be no assurance that the current dividend level will be maintained in future periods 
the company s condominium conversion and for sale condominium housing business involves unique business risks and challenges 
the company s ability to successfully complete a condominium conversion or other for sale housing project  sell the units and achieve management s economic goals in connection with the transaction is subject to various risks and challenges  which if they materialize  may have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition including the inability to obtain approvals to rezone the property and releases from financing obligations and increases in costs resulting from delays in obtaining such approvals and releases  understanding the costs necessary to bring a newly developed or converted for sale condominium property up to standards required for its intended market position  lack of demand by prospective buyers  oversupply of condominiums in a given market  the inability of buyers to qualify for financing  lower than anticipated sale prices  the inability to close on sales of individual units under contract  competition from other condominiums and other types of residential housing  and liability claims from condominium associations or others asserting that construction performed was defective  resulting in litigation and or settlement discussions 
in general  profits realized to date from the company s sale of condominium homes have been more volatile than the company s core apartment rental operations 
in addition  the company believes that the demand of prospective buyers  the supply and competition from other condominiums and other types of residential housing  and the level of mortgage interest rates and the affordability of housing  among other factors  could have a significant impact on its ability to sell for sale units and on the sales prices achieved 
if the company is unable to sell for sale condominium homes  the company could decide to rent unsold units or could cause a condominium community to revert to a rental apartment community 
if these risks were to materialize  it could cause the company to realize impairment losses in future periods and it could cause economic returns that are materially lower than anticipated 
in addition  if the company is unable to sell for sale units  the expenses and carrying costs associated with the ownership of such units would continue 
unfavorable changes in for sale condominium housing in the company s markets and general economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of the company s condominium conversion and newly developed for sale housing business 
in total  the company has converted five apartment communities since  initially consisting of units including one held in a joint venture  into for sale condominium homes 
as of the end of  three of these condominium conversion projects were sold out 
the other two projects  consisting of a unit project in tampa  fl and a unit project in houston  tx  had  on average  closed the sales of approximately of their total units as of february  beginning in the second quarter of  the company also began closing condominium homes at its two newly developed for sale condominium projects  containing homes 
as of the end of  one of these condominium projects containing homes had sold out 
the remaining condominium project containing homes had one condominium home under contract and had closed homes as of february  post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp

index to financial statements beginning in and continuing presently  there has been a substantial decline in the condominium and single family housing markets due to increasing supplies of such assets  weak consumer confidence  tighter credit standards for home purchases  which the company believes has negatively impacted the ability of prospective condominium buyers to qualify for mortgage financing  and a significant slow down in the residential housing market in the us further  the turmoil in the global capital markets and a significant decline in economic growth in the us economy in the second half of and continuing into has resulted in a further decline in demand in the for sale housing markets 
continuing decline in demand  exacerbated by tighter credit standards for home buyers  has led to an oversupply of new for sale housing that affects the price at which the company is able to sell condominium homes and the number of condominium communities that the company is able to develop in the future 
in an effort to reduce its unsold inventory  the company implemented reduced pricing programs which have also resulted in lower condominium profits for as a result of these factors  the pace of condominium closings began to slow in the second half of and has continued to slow through and additionally  a significant portion of the condominium closings at the company s remaining newly developed for sale condominium project resulted from contracts entered into during the second half of when credit standards tightened and markets increased in volatility resulting in a further slowing of the demand for for sale housing 
the company cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain unfavorable  but if the markets continue to be weak or deteriorate further  the pace of condominium sales and closings will be slow during there can be no assurance of the amount or pace of future for sale condominium sales and closings 
to the extent that condominium pricing pressure continues or worsens or we are required to hold unsold units longer than anticipated requiring us to continue to pay debt service  the profitability of these projects may be materially adversely affected and it could cause the company to realize impairment losses in future periods 
the company s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets for impairment indicators 
factors considered in evaluating impairment of the company s existing real estate assets held for investment include significant declines in property operating profits  recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature 
generally  a real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted  estimated future cash flows of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset s net book value at the balance sheet date 
assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of management 
in years prior to as well as in  the company recorded impairment charges on assets held for investment and assets designated as held for sale 
there can be no assurance that the company will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of its assets 
for the years ended december   and  management believes it has applied reasonable estimates and judgments in determining the proper classification of its real estate assets 
however  these estimates require the use of market data values  which are currently difficult to assess 
should external or internal circumstances change requiring the need to shorten the holding periods or adjust the estimated future cash flows of certain of the company s assets  the company could be required to record additional impairment charges 
if any real estate asset held for investment is considered impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value  less selling costs 
any future impairment could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and funds from operations in the period in which the charge is taken 
increased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit the company s ability to retain its residents  lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 
the company s apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents  including other apartment communities and single family rental homes  as well as owner occupied single and multi family homes 
competitive housing in a particular area and the increasing affordability of owner occupied single and multi family homes caused by declining housing prices  mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote home ownership could adversely affect the company s ability to retain its residents  lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 
limited investment opportunities could adversely affect the company s growth 
the company expects that other real estate investors will compete to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties 
these competitors include insurance companies  pension and investment funds  developer partnerships  investment companies and other apartment reits 
this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that the company would likely pursue  and competitors may have greater resources than the company 
as a result  the company may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms  which could adversely affect its growth

index to financial statements changing interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of the company s securities 
the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  debt bearing interest at rates that vary with market interest rates 
therefore  if interest rates increase  the company s interest costs will rise to the extent its variable rate debt is not hedged effectively 
further  while the company s stated goal is to limit variable rate debt to not more than of total indebtedness  management may adjust these levels over time 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of the company s securities to demand a higher annual yield  which could adversely affect the market price of the company s common and preferred stock and debt securities 
interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges 
from time to time when the company anticipates issuing debt securities  it may seek to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
the company may do this to increase the predictability of its financing costs 
also  from time to time  the company may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit its exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates 
if the pricing of new debt securities is not within the parameters of  or market interest rates produce a lower interest cost than the company incurs under  a particular interest rate hedging contract  the contract may be ineffective 
during the third quarter of  the company s outstanding interest rate swap arrangement became ineffective under generally accepted accounting principles 
furthermore  the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has at times involved and may in the future involve material charges 
these charges are typically related to the extent and timing of fluctuations in interest rates 
despite the company s efforts to minimize its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company may not maintain coverage for all of its outstanding indebtedness at any particular time 
if the company does not effectively protect itself from this risk  it may be subject to increased interest costs resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
acquired apartment communities may not achieve anticipated results 
the company may selectively acquire apartment communities that meet its investment criteria 
the company s acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks an acquired community may fail to achieve expected occupancy and rental rates and may fail to perform as expected  the company may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations  and the company s estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate  causing the company to fail to meet its profitability goals 
failure to succeed in new markets may limit the company s growth 
the company may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of its existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise 
the company s historical experience in its existing markets does not ensure that it will be able to operate successfully in new markets 
the company may be exposed to a variety of risks if it chooses to enter new markets 
these risks include  among others an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment or for sale condominium housing market conditions and local economies  an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities  an inability to hire and retain key personnel  and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 
compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to the company s properties by persons with disabilities could result in substantial cost 
the company s multi family housing communities and any newly acquired multi family housing communities must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or the ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations and or commercial facilities as defined by the ada 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of the company s multi family housing communities where such removal is readily achievable 
the ada does not  however  consider residential post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents 
index to financial statements properties  such as multi family housing communities to be public accommodations or commercial facilities  except to the extent portions of such facilities  such as the leasing office  are open to the public 
the company must also comply with the fair housing act  or the fha  which requires that multi family housing communities first occupied after march  be accessible to persons of disabilities 
noncompliance with the fha and ada could result in the imposition of fines  awards of damages to private litigants  payment of attorneys fees and other costs to plaintiffs  substantial litigation costs and substantial costs of remediation 
compliance with the fha could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in a community  including the interiors of apartment units covered under the fha 
in addition to the ada and fha  state and local laws exist that impact the company s multi family housing communities with respect to access thereto by persons with disabilities 
further  legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose additional burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by persons with disabilities 
the ada  fha  or other existing or new legislation may require the company to modify its existing properties 
these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings or may require the company to add other structural features that increase its construction costs 
within the past few years  there has been heightened scrutiny of multi family housing communities for compliance with the requirements of the fha and ada 
in november  the equal rights center  or erc  filed a lawsuit against the company and the operating partnership alleging various violations of the fha and the ada at certain properties designed  constructed or operated by the company and the operating partnership 
the erc seeks compensatory and punitive damages  an award of attorneys fees and costs of suit  as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief that includes retrofitting multi family housing units and public use areas to comply with the fha and ada and prohibiting construction or sale of noncompliant units or complexes 
due to the preliminary nature of the litigation  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal proceeding  nor is it possible to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that would be associated with an adverse decision 
the company cannot ascertain the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada  fha or other similar state and local legislation and such costs are not likely covered by insurance policies 
the cost associated with ongoing litigation or compliance could be substantial and could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  in connection with certain property dispositions or formations of strategic joint ventures  the company may be required to provide indemnification against liabilities associated with the litigation 
losses from natural catastrophes may exceed insurance coverage 
the company carries comprehensive liability  fire  flood  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on its properties  which are believed to be of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets 
the company intends to obtain similar coverage for properties acquired or developed in the future 
however  some losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as losses from floods or wind storms  may be subject to limitations 
the company exercises discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on its investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms  however  the company may not be able to maintain its insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect it against potential losses 
further  the company s insurance costs could increase in future periods 
if the company suffers a substantial loss  its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of the lost investment 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 
the company is in the business of owning  operating  developing  acquiring and  from time to time  selling real estate 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  as a current or former owner or operator  the company could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances  often regardless of its knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of its current or former ownership or operation of the real estate 
in addition  the company could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property and other damages and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
these costs could be substantial  and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment 
the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to borrow against  sell or rent an affected property

index to financial statements costs associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly 
as a general matter  concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as such exposure has been alleged to have a variety of adverse effects on health 
as a result  there has been a number of lawsuits in the company s industry against owners and managers of apartment communities relating to moisture infiltration and resulting mold 
the company has implemented guidelines and procedures to address moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues if and when they arise 
the company believes that these measures will minimize the potential for any adverse effect on its residents 
the terms of its property and general liability policies generally exclude certain mold related claims 
should an uninsured loss arise against the company  the company would be required to use its funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 
the company makes no assurance that liabilities resulting from moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future adverse impact on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the costs of remediating damage to the company s communities that have stucco interiors or exterior insulation finishing systems for potential water penetration and other related issues could exceed current cost estimates 
the company is currently underway with an initiative to engage third party engineers and consultants to inspect and evaluate each of its communities that have stucco exteriors or exterior insulation finishing systems eifs for potential water penetration and other related issues 
at this early stage of the process  the company has preliminarily determined that varying levels of remediation and improvements may be required to be performed at approximately properties in its portfolio 
the company preliminarily estimates that the aggregate cost of this initiative could be approximately million to complete the scope of the remediation and improvements  although the scope and cost will vary considerably among individual properties 
the work is currently underway at approximately seven properties and is expected to be completed at all properties by the work may include  but not be limited to  remediation  improvements and replacements of exterior stucco and eifs siding  windows and doors  roofing and gutters  exterior sealants and coatings 
there can be no assurance that the scope of work or the company s preliminary estimates of costs will not change in the future 
at this early stage of the process  it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on the company s financial position and results of operations in subsequent periods other than as discussed above 
the company s joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company s ability to control such properties and partial interests 
instead of purchasing certain apartment communities directly  the company has invested and may continue to invest as a co venturer 
the company has also chosen to sell partial interests in certain apartment communities to co venturers and may continue this strategy in the future 
joint venturers often have shared control over the operations of the joint venture assets 
therefore  it is possible that the co venturer in an investment might become bankrupt  or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company s business interests or goals  or be in a position to take action contrary to the company s instructions  requests  policies or objectives 
consequently  a co venturer s actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk 
although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence of any joint venture to achieve its objectives  the company may be unable to take action without the company s joint venture partners approval  or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without the company s consent 
additionally  should a joint venture partner become bankrupt  the company could become liable for such partner s share of joint venture liabilities 
the company may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 
when the company s residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration  the company may not be able to relet their units 
even if the residents do renew or the company can relet the units  the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms 
because virtually all of the company s leases are for apartments  they are generally for no more than one year 
if the company is unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units  or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates  then the company s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
consequently  the company s cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced 
the company may fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes depends upon its ability to meet on a continuing basis  through actual annual operating results  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  the various qualification tests and organizational requirements imposed upon reits under the code 
the company believes that it post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents 
index to financial statements has qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended december   and plans to continue to meet the requirements to qualify as a reit in the future 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
therefore  the company may not have qualified or may not continue to qualify in the future as a reit 
the determination that the company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within the company s control 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the company s reit status 
furthermore  congress and the internal revenue service irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new decisions that make it more difficult  or impossible  for the company to remain qualified as a reit 
the company does not believe  however  that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize its reit status 
if the company were to fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year  and certain relief provisions of the internal revenue code did not apply  the company would be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  leaving less money available for distributions to its shareholders 
in addition  distributions to shareholders in any year in which the company failed to qualify would not be deductible by the company for federal income tax purposes nor would they be required to be made 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  the company also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a reit 
it is not possible to predict whether in all circumstances the company would be entitled to such statutory relief 
the company s failure to qualify as a reit likely would have a significant adverse effect on the value of its securities 
the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
management believes that the operating partnership qualifies  and has so qualified since its formation  as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation 
no assurance can be provided  however  that the irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates 
in addition  the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause the company to fail to qualify as a reit 
see the company may fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes above 
the company s shareholders may not be able to effect a change in control 
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the company and the partnership agreement of the operating partnership contain a number of provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company s shareholders or otherwise be in their best interests  including the following preferred shares 
the company s articles of incorporation provide that the company has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  of which  were outstanding as of december  the board of directors has the authority  without the approval of the shareholders  to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights of such shares 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company  even if a change of control were in the shareholders interest 
consent rights of the unitholders 
under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  the company may not merge or consolidate with another entity unless the merger includes the merger of the operating partnership  which requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of the operating partnership 
if the company were to ever hold less than a majority of the units  this voting requirement might limit the possibility for an acquisition or a change of control 
ownership limit 
one of the requirements for maintenance of the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than in value of its outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals  including entities specified in the internal revenue code  during the last half of any taxable year 
to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the ownership limit under the company s articles of incorporation prohibits ownership  directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code  by any person or persons acting as a group of more than of the issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock  subject to certain exceptions  including an exception for shares of common stock held by mr 
john a 
williams and mr 
john t 
glover  the company s former chairman and former vice chairman  respectively  and certain investors for which the company has waived the ownership limit 
together  these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit

there can be no assurances that any such future deficiencies identified may not be material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in future periods 
terrorist attacks and the possibility of wider armed conflict may have an adverse effect on the company s business and operating results and could decrease the value of the company s assets 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact one or more of the company s apartment communities could significantly affect the company s ability to operate those communities and thereby impair its ability to achieve the company s expected results

the plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages  an award of attorneys fees and costs of suit  as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief that includes retrofitting multi family units and public use areas to comply with the fha and the ada and prohibiting construction or sale of noncompliant units or complexes 
on april   erc filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prohibit the company and the operating partnership from selling any alleged noncompliant apartment communities or condominium units while the litigation is ongoing 
on july  the court entered an order denying erc s motion for the preliminary injunction 
discovery is mostly completed by both parties 
however  on august   erc disclosed an alleged million damages assessment for a portion of the compensatory damages claimed

at december   the company owned approximately of the common limited partnership interests common units in the operating partnership

conclusion of strategic process and strategies to enhance shareholder value on january   the company announced that its board of directors had authorized management  working with financial and legal advisors  to initiate a formal process to pursue a possible business combination or other sale transaction and to seek proposals from potentially interested parties 
in the first half of  the company incurred approximately  of strategic review costs related to this process 
the board announced on june  that the process had concluded without a business combination or other sale transaction due to the increasingly difficult market environment and a lack of definitive proposals 
at that same time  the board reaffirmed its commitment to actively pursue other strategies to enhance shareholder value through the following strategies realizing value through asset sales  the proceeds of which can be used to repay debt  pay potential special dividends or repurchase shares  and fund committed investments  cutting costs by reducing corporate overhead  gross development overhead and property management expenses  focusing the company by evaluating the number of markets within which it operates  and the appropriate size of its development pipeline  and pursuing construction loan financing and joint venture equity to fund development activity

the us federal government has nationalized government sponsored mortgage entities  fannie mae and freddie mac  and has taken other substantive actions to stabilize us financial institutions  capital markets and the economy 
in response to these events  the company has adjusted the timing of its strategic priorities by deferring further substantive activities on its pre development pipeline and by focusing on maintaining the relative strength of its balance sheet and the liquidity necessary to fund its operations  including its active pipeline of development projects under construction and its near term debt maturities

the status of the company s financing activities  asset sales  development and cost savings initiatives are discussed in further detail below 
operations overview although the company s operating results have benefited from generally improved fundamentals in the multi family apartment market over the last several years  the rate of growth has been moderating since  and as discussed further below  is forecasted to decline in this was evidenced by year over year increase decrease in same store operating revenues and property net operating income noi of and  respectively  in  compared to  and and  respectively  in  compared to as a result of recent events in the global capital markets and the us economy  including a severe tightening in the credit markets  increasing unemployment and declining consumer confidence  a significant decline in economic growth in the us is forecasted during historically  weaker economic conditions and declining job growth in the us and in the company s markets has led to deteriorating  even negative  revenue and noi growth in the multi family market 
further  the multi family market is being adversely impacted by a substantial decline in the overall us housing market  attributable in part to continued concerns relating to the impact of rising mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures  tighter credit markets and a rising shadow supply of for sale multi family product entering the rental market 
based on the above factors  the company is forecasting a decline in same store community revenues and noi in as more fully discussed in the outlook section below 
if the recession in the us economy were to worsen or continue beyond  the company s operating results would be adversely affected 
in addition  the overall tightening of the credit markets and current conditions in the global capital markets and the us economy could also make it increasingly difficult for the company to actively pursue sales of its assets currently held for sale and will continue to adversely impact the company s ability to obtain joint venture or other financing for its development projects while these conditions persist 
during the year ended december   the company reduced its headcount approximately  including an approximately reduction in headcount in corporate office positions  through a combination of asset sales  out sourcing  attrition and positions eliminated 
in connection with these headcount reductions  the company incurred severance charges during of approximately  the company also implemented a salary freeze for associates with base salaries greater than  substantially reduced bonuses  including eliminating any incentive bonus for for the company s president and ceo  reduced long term incentives for executive officers for and targeted long term incentives for in addition  at his request  compensation paid to the chairman of the company s board of directors was substantially reduced for and waived entirely for there can be no assurance that the company will not recognize additional severance charges in future periods 
the company is currently marketing for sale three apartment communities  totaling  units  including two communities located in atlanta  georgia and one community located in the northern virginia submarket of greater washington  dc gross proceeds that may potentially be realized by the company from the sales of these three communities are expected to be utilized consistent with the company s liquidity and balance sheet strategy discussed above and are currently expected to be in excess of  however  current conditions in the global capital markets and the us economy discussed above may adversely affect the company s ability to sell assets  making it difficult for potential buyers to obtain financing at attractive terms or at all 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the potential gross proceeds will be realized by the company  used for the purposes intended or that these assets will be sold 
the company s asset sales strategy over the past several years has been focused on repositioning its real estate portfolio and building its development and value creation capabilities centered upon its southeast  southwest and mid atlantic regions 
during this time  the company was a net seller of apartment assets in an effort to exploit opportunities to harvest post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp

index to financial statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share or unit and apartment unit data value and recycle capital through the sale of non core assets that no longer met the company s growth objectives 
the company s asset sales program has been consistent with its strategy of reducing its concentration in atlanta  georgia  building critical mass in fewer markets and leveraging the post brand in order to improve operating efficiencies 
the company has redeployed capital raised from its asset sales to strengthen its balance sheet  by reducing high coupon preferred equity and debt  and reinvesting in assets that the company believes demonstrate better growth potential 
in this regard  the company disposed of  and  apartment units in  and  respectively  for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
in  the company also transferred three communities  containing  apartment units  to a newly formed unconsolidated entity  in which the company retained a interest 
the interest in these communities effectively sold to the institutional partner generated gross proceeds of approximately  during this same period  the company acquired and apartment units for aggregate gross purchase prices of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
there were no communities acquired in as more fully described in current development activity below  the company made the decision to defer further substantive activities on all of its pre development projects and to abandon the pursuit of certain other development projects in light of difficult market conditions 
additionally  during  management evaluated its current expectations regarding the timing and projected undiscounted future cash flows from land held for future development including the company s expectations of possible future uses  capitalization rates  investors return expectations  rental rates and operating cash flows and reduced its expectations regarding the estimated fair values of its land holdings 
as a result  the company recorded non cash impairment charges of approximately  for the year ended december  to write down a substantial portion of its land held for sale and land held for future investment including the company s interest in a joint venture that holds land for future investment to estimated fair market value and to write off approximately  in pursuit costs on abandoned projects 
after considering the impact of the impairment charges discussed above  which on a cumulative basis represented an approximately reduction to the original aggregate carrying values of its land assets  the company s land held for future investment and sale totaled approximately  at december  at present  management believes that the timing of future development starts will depend largely on the stabilization of capital market conditions and the us economy  which it believes will influence conditions in employment and the local real estate markets  the company s ability to generate asset sales proceeds and its ability to attract potential construction loan financing and joint venture equity to fund future development 
until such time as substantive development activities re commence or certain land positions are sold  the company expects that operating results will be adversely impacted by costs of carrying land held for future investment or sale 
as of december   the company s aggregate pipeline of development projects under construction totaled approximately  including the company s share  net of joint venture partner interests  of 
as of the same date  approximately  of estimated construction costs remained to be funded by the company or approximately  excluding committed construction loan financing and escrow deposits held by the construction lender 
the company expects to fund future estimated construction expenditures primarily by utilizing available cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under its unsecured revolving lines of credit 
see liquidity and capital resources below where discussed further 
based on the factors discussed above  there can be no assurance that land held for investment will be developed in the future or at all 
should the company further change its expectations regarding the timing and projected undiscounted future cash flows expected from land held for future investment  the company may be required to recognize additional impairment losses in future periods 
should the company change its current estimates of the fair value of assets held for sale to below their carrying values  the company may also be required to recognize additional impairment losses in future periods 
in early  the company entered the for sale condominium housing market to exploit the strategic opportunity for post to serve those consumers who are choosing to own  rather than rent  their home 
in total  the company has converted five apartment communities since  initially consisting of units including one held in a joint venture  into for sale post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp

as of the end of  three of these condominium conversion projects were sold out 
the other two projects  containing a total of units  had on average closed the sales of approximately of their total units as of february  beginning in the second quarter of  the company also began closing condominium homes at two of its newly developed for sale condominium projects  containing homes 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed the sell out of its condominium project in the greater washington  dc area  containing homes 
the second newly developed condominium project in dallas  texas had closed the sales of approximately of its total units as of february  in addition  the company and its affiliates are developing two luxury for sale condominium developments the ritz carlton residences  atlanta  buckhead  consisting of units  and the four seasons residences in austin  texas  consisting of units 
beginning in and continuing presently  there has been a substantial decline in the condominium and single family housing markets due to increasing supplies of such assets  weak consumer confidence  tighter credit markets for home purchasers  which the company believes has negatively impacted the ability of prospective condominium buyers to qualify for mortgage financing  and a significant slow down in the residential housing market in the us further  as a result of the turmoil in the global capital markets and a recession in the us economy discussed above  the for sale housing markets are likely to continue to be weak and may even deteriorate further 
as a result  condominium closings are likely to be slow at these communities into the company implemented reduced pricing programs in in an effort to reduce its unsold condominium inventory at its completed and active for sale projects 
these reduced pricing programs have generally resulted in lower condominium profits in compared to prior years 
there can be no assurance of the amount or pace of future for sale condominium sales and closings 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement contained herein  the company uses the relative sales value method to allocate costs and recognize profits from condominium projects 
this method requires the company to estimate its total condominium profits costs and profits each period 
should the company further adjust its estimates regarding costs and profits expected to be realized from its condominium projects in future periods  the company may recognize additional losses in subsequent periods to reduce estimated profits previously recorded or may recognize impairment losses if the carrying value of these assets is not deemed recoverable 
the company s expansion into for sale condominium housing exposes the company to additional risks and challenges  which if they materialize  could have an adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   the company had approximately  of total estimated capital cost based on book value and including the company s investment in unconsolidated entities committed to its for sale condominium conversion and ground up development projects  including the company s share of projected development costs expected to be funded relating to for sale projects currently under construction and held for sale

critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements in the preparation of financial statements and in the determination of company operating performance  the company utilizes certain significant accounting polices and these accounting policies are discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  there are new accounting pronouncements issued in and that may have an impact on future reported results 
the potential impact of certain new pronouncements on the company is discussed below and in the consolidated financial statements 
as the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing apartment communities and developing  converting and selling for sale condominiums  its critical accounting policies  ones that are subject to significant management estimates and judgments  relate to cost capitalization  asset impairment evaluation and revenue and profit recognition of for sale condominium activities 
for communities under development or rehabilitation  the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes  and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to apartment communities under development and construction 
interest capitalized to projects under development or construction can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on the level of projects under development or construction and to a lesser extent  changes in the weighted average interest rate used in the calculation 
for the years ended december   and  the company capitalized interest totaling   and  respectively 
the increase in capitalized interest primarily relates to a significantly increased development pipeline over the last few years 
the weighted average interest rates used in the calculation of the capitalized interest amounts ranged from to from to and  as a result  were not the primary driver of the changes in interest capitalization discussed above 
in  the company anticipates decreased interest capitalization over levels due to the completion of current projects under development throughout and due to a decision to cease new development starts due to conditions in the global capital markets and the us economy 
the average interest rate used in the interest capitalization calculation is expected to be substantially the same or somewhat lower than due to the predominately fixed rate nature of the company s debt  future increases or decreases in short term interest rates are not expected to have a significant impact on the weighted average interest rate used for interest capitalization purposes 
future increases in short term and long term interest rates over time would cause an increase in the weighted average rate used for capitalization and cause interest amounts capitalized to increase 
internal personnel and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development or construction based upon the effort associated with such projects 
until early  the company had been increasing its development personnel in three regional geographic areas in anticipation of increased development activity in and in  and  the company expensed   and  respectively  of development personnel and associated costs 
in anticipation of slower development starts and lower development cost volumes in compared to  the company reduced the size and cost of its investment and development division principally through headcount reductions occurring in the later half of the company expects lower capitalization of development personnel and associated costs to development projects in  but due to reduced personnel and other costs  the company expects investment and development expense to be somewhat lower than in if the company does not initiate new development starts later in and into  aggregate expensed development and investment expenses will increase into without further cost reductions 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets using the methodology summarized in its accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under current accounting literature  the evaluation of the recoverability of the company s real estate assets requires the judgment of company management in the determination of the value of the future cash flows expected from the assets and the estimated holding post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents 
index to financial statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share or unit and apartment unit data period for the assets 
the company uses market capitalization rates to determine the estimated residual value of its real estate assets and  generally  takes a long term view of the holding period of its assets unless specific facts and circumstances warrant shorter holding periods expected sales  departures from certain geographic markets  etc the company considers a real estate asset held for investment as impaired if the undiscounted  estimated future cash flows of the asset both the annual estimated cash flow from future operations and the estimated cash flow from the asset s eventual sale over its expecting holding period are less than the asset s net book value 
for real estate assets held for sale  the company recognizes impairment losses if an asset s net book value is in excess of its estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
at december  and  management believed it had applied reasonable estimates and judgments in determining the proper classification of its real estate assets 
in  the severe downturn in overall economic conditions in the us and the lack of available capital have significantly impacted the value of real estate in the us including land  assets under development and operating assets held by the company 
following the methodology discussed herein  the company recorded aggregate impairment charges of  in to reduce a substantial portion of its land held for sale and land held for future investment and their associated pre development costs to their estimated fair market value 
the company also wrote off  in capitalized pursuit costs associated with abandoned projects in see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company s methodologies for determining the fair value of the company s real estate assets and for a further discussion of impairment charges recorded in should external or internal circumstances change requiring the need to shorten the holding periods or adjust the estimated future cash flows of certain of the company s assets  the company could be required to record future impairment charges 
in addition  for sale condominium assets under development are evaluated for impairment using the methodology for assets held for future investment using projected future undiscounted cash flows 
however  once construction of these assets is completed and units are ready for their intended use  for sale condominium assets are evaluated for impairment using the methodology for assets held for sale using discounted projected future cash flows 
thus  should the company s estimates of discounted future cash flows from completed condominium assets be deemed insufficient to recover the carrying value of those assets in future periods  the company may be required to recognize future impairment losses on those assets in such periods 
the company and its affiliates currently own interests in two luxury condominium assets with a total projected cost of approximately  the company s share  net of its joint venture partner s interest in one project  is approximately 
initial condominium units in these projects are currently expected to completed and delivered for their intended use starting in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  respectively 
at december   the company is selling condominiums at two condominium conversion communities and at one developed community completed in a second developed community sold its final units in late under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 the company recognizes revenue and the resulting profit from condominium sales based on the relevant facts and circumstances associated with each condominium project 
for condominium conversion projects  revenues are recognized upon the closing of each sale transaction the completed contract method  as all conditions for full profit recognition are generally met at that time and the conversion construction periods are typically very short 
in and  sales occurred at both the condominium conversion and developed communities 
under sfas no 
 the company uses the relative sales value method to allocate costs and recognize profits from condominium sales 
under the relative sales value method  estimates of aggregate project revenues and aggregate project costs are used to determine the allocation of project cost of sales and the resulting profit in each accounting period 
in subsequent periods  project cost of sale allocations and profits are adjusted to reflect changes in the actual and estimated costs and revenues of each project 
unexpected increases or decreases in estimated project revenues and project costs could cause future cost of sale and profit margin amounts recognized in the financial statements to be different than the amounts recognized in prior periods 
as the company continues in the condominium business in future periods  changes in estimates of this nature could have a significant impact on reported future results from operations 
for developed condominiums  the company evaluates the factors specified in sfas no 
and the guidance provided by eitf issue no 
eitf no 
to determine the appropriate method of accounting for each project either the percentage of completion method or the completed contract method 
the factors used to determine the appropriate method are a determination of whether the purchaser is legally committed to closing in the real estate contract  the construction of the project is beyond a preliminary phase  sufficient units have been contracted to ensure the project will post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp

and eitf no 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues and the associated profit would be recognized over the project construction period based on the ratio of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs 
the determination of the profit margins to be reported also requires an estimate of the estimated aggregate revenues to be generated from condominium sales 
increases in estimated revenues and decreases in estimated costs over time would lead to increased profit recognition in future periods 
likewise  decreases in estimated revenues and increases in estimated costs over time would lead to reductions in profit margins in future periods 
additionally  contracts terminated prior to closing under the percentage of completion method would result in the reversal of previously recognized profits and such amounts could be material under market conditions that may lead to a general market value decline for condominiums 
to date  the company accounts for revenues  project cost of sales and resulting profits at all of its condominium development projects under the completed contract method  similar to the accounting for condominium conversion projects discussed above 
this conclusion was based upon the determination that the initial and continuing cash investments received did not meet the requirements of sfas no

results of operations the following discussion of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of operations  the accompanying selected financial data and the community operations segment performance information included below 
the company s revenues and earnings from continuing operations are generated primarily from the operation of its apartment communities 
for purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance  the company categorizes its operating apartment communities based on the period each community reaches stabilized occupancy 
the company generally considers a community to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier to occur of attainment of physical occupancy on the first day of any month or one year after completion of construction 
for the year ended december   the company s portfolio of operating apartment communities  excluding five communities held in unconsolidated entities  consisted of the following communities that were completed and stabilized for all of the current and prior year  two communities that achieved full stabilization during  portions of two communities that are being converted into condominiums that are reflected in continuing operations under sfas no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  one operating community that was acquired in  and six communities and an additional phase of one community under rehabilitation programs or in lease up 
these operating segments exclude the operations of three apartment communities classified as discontinued operations  and three apartment communities currently under development not currently in lease up

index to financial statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share or unit and apartment unit data the company has adopted an accounting policy related to communities in the lease up stage whereby substantially all operating expenses including pre opening marketing and management and leasing personnel expenses are expensed as incurred 
during the lease up phase  the sum of interest expense on completed units and other operating expenses including pre opening marketing and management and leasing personnel expenses will initially exceed rental revenues  resulting in a lease up deficit  which continues until such time as rental revenues exceed such expenses 
the lease up deficits for the years ended december   and were approximately   and  respectively 
in order to evaluate the operating performance of its communities for the comparative years listed below  the company has presented financial information which summarizes the rental and other revenues  property operating and maintenance expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and net operating income on a comparative basis for all of its operating communities and for its stabilized operating communities 
net operating income is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
the company believes that the line on the company s consolidated statement of operations entitled net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to net operating income 
net operating income is reconciled to gaap net income in the financial information accompanying the tables 
the company believes that net operating income is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a reit s operating real estate because it provides a measure of the core operations  rather than factoring in depreciation and amortization  financing costs and general and administrative expenses 
this measure is particularly useful  in the opinion of the company  in evaluating the performance of geographic operations  operating segment groupings and individual properties 
additionally  the company believes that net operating income  as defined  is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate investment community

until such time as substantive development activities re commence or certain land positions are sold  the company expects that operating results will be adversely impacted by costs of carrying land held for future investment or sale 
inflation for each of the last three years and as of december   substantially all of the leases at the communities allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder  and thus may enable the company to seek increases in rents 
the substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less and the remaining leases are for up to two years 
at the expiration of a lease term  the company s lease agreements generally provide that the term will be extended unless either the company or the lessee gives at least sixty days written notice of termination 
in addition  the company s policy generally permits the earlier termination of a lease by a lessee upon thirty days written notice to the company and the payment of an amount equal to two month s rent as compensation for early termination 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to offset the risk to the company that the adverse effect of inflation may have on the company s general  administrative and operating expenses 
funds from operations the company uses the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of funds from operations ffo 
ffo is defined by nareit as net income available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap 
ffo is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies because not all real estate companies use the same definition 
the company s ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the current nareit definition 
the company also uses ffo as an operating measure 
accounting for real estate assets using historical cost accounting under gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its april white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  the concept of ffo was created by nareit for the reit industry to provide an alternate measure 
since the company agrees with the concept of ffo and appreciates the reasons surrounding its creation  management believes that ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance 
in addition  since most equity reits provide ffo information to the investment community  the company believes ffo is a useful supplemental measure for comparing the company s results to those of other equity reits 
the company believes that the line on the company s consolidated statement of operations entitled net income available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo

while management believes that ffo is an important supplemental non gaap financial measure  management believes it is also important to stress that ffo should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity
