item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the oil and gas industry in which the company participates has historically experienced significant volatility 
demand for the company s services and products depends primarily upon the general level of activity in the oil and gas industry worldwide  including the number of drilling rigs in operation  the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of these wells  the volume of production  the number of well completions and the level of well remediation activity 
oil and gas activity is in turn heavily influenced by  among other factors  oil and gas prices worldwide 
high levels of drilling and well remediation activity generally spur demand for the company s products and services used to drill and remediate oil and gas wells 
additionally  high levels of oil and gas activity increase cash flows available for drilling contractors  oilfield service companies  and manufacturers of oil country tubular goods to invest in capital equipment that the company sells 
beginning in early  increasing oil and gas prices led to steadily rising levels of drilling activity throughout the world 
concerns about the long term availability of oil and gas supply also began to build 
consequently  the worldwide rig count increased in  in  and in as a result of higher cash flows realized by many drilling contractors and other oilfield service companies  as well as the long term concerns about supply demand imbalance and the need to replace aging equipment  market conditions for capital equipment purchases have improved significantly since and  resulting in higher backlogs for the company at the end of compared to the end of and backlog for the company was at approximately billion at december  compared to approximately billion and billion for december  and  respectively 
in  most of the company s rig technology revenue resulted from major capital expenditures of drilling contractors  well servicing companies  and oil companies on rig construction and refurbishment  and well servicing equipment 
these capital expenditures are influenced by the amount of cash flow that contractors and service companies generate from drilling  completion  and remediation activity  as well as by the availability of financing  the outlook for future drilling and well servicing activity  and other factors 
generally the company believes the demand for capital equipment lags increases in the level of drilling activity 
the remainder of the rig technology segment s revenue in was related to the sale of spare parts and consumables  the provision of equipment repair services  and the rental of equipment  which the company believes are generally determined directly by the level of drilling and well servicing activity 

table of contents the majority of the company s petroleum services supplies revenue is closely tied to drilling activity  although a portion is related to the sale of capital equipment to drilling contractors  which may somewhat lag the level of drilling activity 
portions of the segment s revenue that are not tied to drilling activity include i the sale of progressive cavity pumps and solids control equipment for use in industrial applications  and ii the sale of fiberglass and composite tubing to industrial customers  which is generally unrelated to drilling or well remediation activity but may be tied somewhat to oil and gas prices 
the company s revenue from distribution services is almost entirely driven by drilling activity and oil and gas production activities 
drilling and well servicing activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time 
the willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital investments to explore for and produce oil and natural gas will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which the company has no control  including the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to maintain oil price stability through voluntary production limits of oil  the level of oil production by non opec countries  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  general economic and political conditions  costs of exploration and production  the availability of new leases and concessions  access to external financing  and governmental regulations regarding  among other things  environmental protection  taxation  price controls and product allocations 
the willingness of drilling contractors and well servicing companies to make capital expenditures for the type of specialized equipment the company provides is also influenced by numerous factors over which the company has no control  including the general level of oil and gas well drilling and servicing  rig dayrates  access to external financing  outlook for future increases in well drilling and well remediation activity  steel prices and fabrication costs  and government regulations regarding  among other things  environmental protection  taxation  and price controls 
overview of oil and gas well drilling and servicing processes oil and gas wells are usually drilled by drilling contractors using a drilling rig 
a bit is attached to the end of a drill stem  which is assembled by the drilling rig and its crew from foot joints of drill pipe and specialized drilling components known as downhole tools 
using the conventional rotary drilling method  the drill stem is turned from the rotary table of the drilling rig by torque applied to the kelly  which is screwed into the top of the drill stem 
increasingly  drilling is performed using a drilling motor  which is attached to the bottom of the drill stem and provides rotational force directly to the bit  rather than such force being supplied by the rotary table 
the use of a drilling motor permits the drilling contractor to drill directionally  including horizontally 
the company sells and rents drilling motors  downhole tools and drill pipe through its petroleum services supplies segment 
during drilling  heavy drilling fluids or drilling muds are pumped down the drill stem and forced out through jets in the bit 
the drilling mud returns to the surface through the space between the borehole wall and the drill stem  carrying with it the drill cuttings drilled out by the bit 
the drill cuttings are removed from the mud by a solids control system which can include shakers  centrifuges and other specialized equipment and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner 
the solids control system permits the mud  which is often comprised of expensive chemicals  to be continuously reused and recirculated back into the hole 
through its rig technology segment  the company sells the large mud pumps that are used to pump drilling mud through the drill stem 
through its petroleum services supplies business  the company sells transfer pumps and mud pump consumables  sells and rents solids control equipment  and provides solids control and waste management services 
many operators internally coat the drill stem to improve its hydraulic efficiency and protect it from corrosive fluids sometimes encountered during drilling  and inspect and assess the integrity of the drill pipe from time to time 
the company provides drill pipe inspection and coating services  and applies hardbanding material to drill pipe to improve its wear characteristics 
these services are provided through the company s petroleum services supplies segment 
as the hole depth increases  the kelly must be removed frequently so that additional foot joints of drill pipe can be added to the drill stem 
when the bit becomes dull or the equipment at the bottom of the drill stem including the drilling motors otherwise requires servicing  the entire drill stem is pulled out of the hole and disassembled by disconnecting the joints of drill pipe 
these are set aside or racked  the old bit is replaced or service is performed  and the drill stem is reassembled and lowered back into the hole a process called tripping 
during drilling and tripping operations  joints of drill pipe must be screwed together and tightened made up  and loosened and unscrewed spun out 
the company s rig technology business provides drilling equipment to manipulate and maneuver the drill pipe in this manner 
when the hole has reached certain depths  all of the drill pipe is pulled out of the hole and larger diameter pipe known as casing is lowered into the hole and permanently cemented in place in order to protect against collapse and contamination of the hole 
the casing is typically inspected before it is lowered into the hole  a service the company s petroleum services supplies business provides 
the company s rig technology segment manufactures pressure pumping equipment that is used to cement the casing in place 
the raising and lowering of the drill stem while drilling or tripping  and the lowering of casing into the wellbore  are accomplished with the rig s hoisting system 
a conventional hoisting system is a block and tackle mechanism that works within the drilling rig s derrick 
the lifting of this mechanism is performed via a series of pulleys that are attached to the drawworks at the base of the derrick 
the company s rig technology segment sells and installs drawworks and pipe hoisting systems 
during the course of normal drilling operations  the drill stem passes through different geological formations  which exhibit varying pressure characteristics 
if this 
table of contents pressure is not contained  oil  gas and or water would flow out of these formations to the surface 
the two means of containing these pressures are i primarily the circulation of drilling muds while drilling and ii secondarily the use of blowout preventers should the mud prove inadequate and in an emergency situation 
the company s rig technology group sells and services blowout preventers bops 
drilling muds are carefully designed to exhibit certain qualities that optimize the drilling process 
in addition to containing formation pressure  they must i provide power to the drilling motor  ii carry drilled solids to the surface  iii protect the drilled formations from being damaged  and iv cool the drill bit 
achieving these objectives often requires a formulation specific to a given well and can involve the use of expensive chemicals as well as natural materials such as certain types of clay 
the fluid itself is often oil or more expensive synthetic mud 
given this expense  it is highly desirable to reuse as much of the drilling mud as possible 
solids control equipment such as shale shakers  centrifuges  cuttings dryers  and mud cleaners help accomplish this objective 
the company s petroleum services supplies group rents  sells  operates and services this equipment 
drilling muds are formulated based on expected drilling conditions 
however  as the hole is drilled  the drill stem may encounter a high pressure zone where the mud density is inadequate to maintain sufficient pressure 
should efforts to weight up the mud in order to contain such a pressure kick fail  a blowout could result  whereby reservoir fluids would flow uncontrolled into the well 
to prevent blowouts to the surface of the well  a series of high pressure valves known as blowout preventers are positioned at the top of the well and  when activated  form tight seals that prevent the escape of fluids 
when closed  conventional bops prevent normal rig operations 
therefore  the bops are activated only if drilling mud and normal well control procedures cannot safely contain the pressure 
bops have been designed to contain pressures of up to  psi 
the operations of the rig and the condition of the drilling mud are closely monitored by various sensors  which measure operating parameters such as the weight on the rig s hook  the incidence of pressure kicks  the operation of the drilling mud pumps  etc 
through its rig technology segment  the company sells and rents drilling rig instrumentation packages that perform these monitoring functions 
during the drilling and completion of a well  there exists an ongoing need for various consumables and spare parts 
while most of these items are small  in the aggregate they represent an important element of the process 
since it is impractical for each drilling location to have a full supply of these items  drilling contractors and well service companies tend to rely on third parties to stock and deliver these items 
the company provides this capability through its distribution services segment  which stocks and sells spares and consumables made by third parties  as well as spares and consumables made by the company 
after the well has reached its total depth and the final section of casing has been set  the drilling rig is moved off of the well and the well is prepared to begin producing oil or gas in a process known as well completion 
well completion usually involves installing production tubing concentrically in the casing 
due to the corrosive nature of many produced fluids  production tubing is often inspected and coated  services offered by the company s petroleum services supplies business 
sometimes operators choose to use corrosion resistant composite materials which the company offers through its petroleum services supplies business  or corrosion resistant alloys  or operators sometimes pump fluids into wells to inhibit corrosion 
from time to time  a producing well may undergo workover procedures to extend its life and increase its production rate 
workover rigs are used to disassemble the wellhead  tubing and other completion components of an existing well in order to stimulate or remediate the well 
workover rigs are similar to drilling rigs in their capabilities to handle tubing  but are usually smaller and somewhat less sophisticated 
the company offers a comprehensive range of workover rigs through its rig technology segment 
tubing and sucker rods removed from a well during a well remediation operation are often inspected to determine their suitability to be reused in the well  which is a service the company s petroleum services supplies business provides 
frequently coiled tubing units or wireline units are used to accomplish certain well remediation operations or well completions 
coiled tubing is a recent advancement in petroleum technology consisting of a continuous length of reeled steel tubing which can be injected concentrically into the production tubing all the way to the bottom of most wells 
it permits many operations to be performed without disassembling the production tubing  and without curtailing the production of the well 
wireline winch units are devices that utilize single strand or multistrand wires to perform well remediation operations  such as lowering tools and transmitting data to the surface 
through the rig technology segment  the company sells and rents various types of coiled tubing equipment  and wireline equipment and tools 
the company also manufactures and sells coiled tubing pipe through its petroleum services supplies segment 
rig technology the company has a long tradition of pioneering innovations in drilling and well servicing equipment which improve the efficiency  safety  and cost of drilling and well servicing operations 
the rig technology segment designs  manufactures and sells a wide variety of top drives  automated pipe handling systems  motion compensation systems  rig controls  bops  handling tools  drawworks  risers  rotary tables  mud pumps  cranes  drilling motors and other drilling equipment for both the onshore and offshore markets 
the rig technology segment also manufactures entire rig packages  both drilling and workover  in addition to well servicing equipment such as coiled tubing units  pressure pumping equipment  and wireline winches 
the rig technology group sells directly to drilling 
table of contents contractors  shipyards and other rig fabricators  well servicing companies  national oil companies  major and independent oil and gas companies  supply stores  and pipe running service providers 
the rig technology segment rents and sells proprietary drilling rig instrumentation packages and control systems which monitor various processes throughout the drilling operation  under the name md totco instrumentation 
demand for its products  several of which are described below  is strongly dependent upon capital spending plans by oil and gas companies and drilling contractors  and the level of oil and gas well drilling activity 
land rig packages 
nov designs  manufactures  assembles  upgrades  and supplies equipment sets to a variety of land drilling rigs  including those specifically designed to operate in harsh environments such as the arctic circle and the desert 
our key land rig product names include the ideal rig and rapid rig 
nov s recent rig packages are designed to be safer and fast moving  to utilize ac technology  and to reduce manpower required to operate a rig 
top drives 
the top drive drilling system tds  originally introduced by nov in  significantly alters the traditional drilling process 
the tds rotates the drill stem from its top  rather than by the rotary table  with a large electric motor affixed to rails installed in the derrick that traverses the length of the derrick to the rig floor 
therefore  the tds eliminates the use of the conventional rotary table for drilling 
components of the tds also are used to connect additional joints of drill pipe to the drill stem during drilling operations  enabling drilling with three joints of drill pipe compared to traditionally drilling with one joint of drill pipe 
additionally  the tds facilitates horizontal and extended reach drilling 
drilling motors 
nov has helped lead the application of ac motor technology in the oilfield industry 
we are now transitioning from buying motors from third parties to building them in our own facilities and further developing motor technology  including the introduction of permanent magnet motor technology to the industry 
these permanent magnet motors are being used in top drives  cranes  mud pumps  winches  and drawworks 
rotary equipment 
the alternative to using a tds to rotate the drill stem is to use a rotary table  which rotates the pipe at the floor of the rig 
the rig technology group produces rotary tables as well as kelly bushings and master bushings for most sizes of kellys and makes of rotary tables 
in  nov introduced the rotary support table for use on rigs with a tds 
the rotary support table is used in concert with the tds to completely eliminate the need for the larger conventional rotary table 
pipe handling systems 
pipe racking systems are used to handle drill pipe  casing and tubing on a drilling rig 
vertical pipe racking systems move drill pipe and casing between the well and a storage racking area on the rig floor 
horizontal racking systems are used to handle tubulars while stored horizontally for example  on the pipe deck of an offshore rig and transport tubulars up to the rig floor and into a vertical position for use in the drilling process 
vertical pipe racking systems are used predominantly on offshore rigs and are found on almost all floating rigs 
mechanical vertical pipe racking systems greatly reduce the manual effort involved in pipe handling 
pipe racking systems  introduced by nov in  provide a fully automated mechanism for handling and racking drill pipe during drilling and tripping operations  spinning and torquing drill pipe  and automatic hoisting and racking of disconnected joints of drill pipe 
these functions can be integrated via computer controlled sequencing  and operated by a driller in an environmentally secure cabin 
an important element of this system is the iron roughneck  which was originally introduced by nov in and is an automated device that makes pipe connections on the rig floor and requires less direct involvement of rig floor personnel in potentially dangerous operations 
the automated roughneck is an automated microprocessor controlled version of the iron roughneck 
horizontal pipe transfer systems were introduced by nov in they include the pipe deck machine pdm  which is used to manipulate and move tubulars while stored in a horizontal position  the pipe transfer conveyor ptc  which transports sections of pipe to the rig floor  and a pickup laydown system pls  which raises the pipe to a vertical position for transfer to a vertical racking system 
these components may be employed separately  or incorporated together to form a complete horizontal racking system  known as the pipe transfer system pts 
pipe handling tools 
the company s pipe handling tools are designed to enhance the safety  efficiency and reliability of pipe handling operations 
many of these tools have provided innovative methods of performing the designated task through mechanization of functions previously performed manually 
the rig technology group manufactures various tools used to grip  hold  raise  and lower pipe  and in the making up and breaking out of drill pipe  workstrings  casing and production tubulars including spinning wrenches  manual tongs  torque wrenches and kelly spinners 
mud pumps 
mud pumps are high pressure pumps located on the rig that force drilling mud down the drill pipe  through the drill bit  and up the space between the drill pipe and the drilled formation the annulus back to the surface 
these pumps  which generate pressures of up to  psi  must therefore be capable of displacing drilling fluids several thousand feet down and back up the well bore 
the conventional mud pump design  known as the triplex pump  uses three reciprocating pistons oriented horizontally 
recently  nov has introduced the hex pump  which uses six pumping cylinders  versus the three used in the triplex pump 
along with other design features  the greater number of cylinders reduces pulsations or surges and increases the output available from a given 
table of contents footprint 
reduced pulsation is desirable where downhole measurement equipment is being used during the drilling process  as is often the case in directional drilling 
hoisting systems 
hoisting systems are used to raise or lower the drill stem while drilling or tripping  and to lower casing into the wellbore 
the drawworks is the heart of the hoisting system 
it is a large winch that spools off or takes in the drilling line  which is in turn connected to the drill stem at the top of the derrick 
the drawworks also plays an important role in keeping the weight on the drill bit at a desired level 
this task is particularly challenging on offshore drilling rigs  which are subject to wave motion 
to address this  nov has introduced the active heave drilling ahd drawworks 
the ahd drawworks uses computer controlled motors to compensate for the motion experienced in offshore drilling operations 
cranes 
nov provides a comprehensive range of crane solutions  with purpose built products for all segments of the oil and gas industry as well as many other markets 
the company encompasses a broad collection of brand names with international recognition  and includes a large staff of engineers specializing in the design of cranes and related equipment 
the product range extends from small cargo handling cranes to the world s largest marine cranes 
in all  the company provides over twenty crane product lines that include standard model configurations as well as custom engineered and specialty cranes 
motion compensation systems 
traditionally  motion compensation equipment is located on top of the drilling rig and serves to stabilize the bit on the bottom of the hole  increasing drilling effectiveness of floating offshore rigs by compensating for wave and wind action 
the ahd drawworks  discussed above  was introduced to eliminate weight and improve safety  removing the compensator from the top of the rig and integrating it into the drawworks system 
in addition to the ahd drawworks  nov has introduced an active heave compensation ahc system that goes beyond the capabilities of the ahd drawworks to handle the most severe weather 
additionally  nov tensioning systems provide continuous axial tension to the marine riser pipe larger diameter pipe which connects floating drilling rigs to the well on the ocean floor and guide lines on floating drilling rigs  tension leg platforms and jack up drilling rigs 
blowout preventers 
bops are devices used to seal the space annulus between the drill pipe and the borehole to prevent blowouts uncontrolled flows of formation fluids and gases to the surface 
the rig technology group manufactures a wide array of bops used in various situations 
ram and annular bops are back up devices that are activated only if other techniques for controlling pressure in the wellbore are inadequate 
when closed  these devices prevent normal rig operations 
ram bops seal the wellbore by hydraulically closing rams thick heavy blocks of steel against each other across the wellbore 
specially designed packers seal around specific sizes of pipe in the wellbore  shear pipe in the wellbore or close off an open hole 
annular bops seal the wellbore by hydraulically closing a rubber packing unit around the drill pipe or kelly or by sealing against itself if nothing is in the hole 
nov s pressure control while drilling pcwd bop  introduced in  allows operators to drill at pressures up to  psi without interrupting normal operations  and can act as a normal spherical bop at pressures up to  psi 
in  nov introduced the nxt ram type bop which eliminates door bolts  providing significant weight  rig time  and space savings 
its unique features make subsea operation more efficient through faster ram configuration changes without tripping the bop stack 
in  nov introduced the lxt  which features many of the design elements of the nxt  but is targeted at the land market 
in  the company began commercializing technology related to a continuous circulation device 
this device enables drilling contractors to make and break drill pipe connections without stopping the circulation of drilling fluids  which helps increase drilling efficiency 
derricks and substructures 
drilling activities are carried out from a drilling rig 
a drilling rig consists of one or two derricks  the substructure that supports the derrick s  and the rig package  which consists of the various pieces of equipment discussed above 
the rig technology segment designs  fabricates and services derricks used in both onshore and offshore applications  and substructures used in onshore applications 
the rig technology group also works with shipyards in the fabrication of substructures for offshore drilling rigs 
instrumentation 
the company s instrumentation business provides drilling rig operators real time measurement and monitoring of critical parameters required to improve rig safety and efficiency 
in  the company introduced its rigsense wellsite information system  which combines leading hardware and software technologies into an integrated drilling rig package 
access of drilling data is provided to offsite locations  enabling company personnel to monitor drilling operations from an office environment  through a secure link 
systems are both sold and rented  and are comprised of hazardous area sensors placed throughout the rig to measure critical drilling parameters  all networked back to a central command station for review  recording and interpretation 
this allows key rig personnel to perform individual jobs more effectively 
the company has evolved from data collection to a leading drilling information provider by using state of the art satellite communications to increase operational efficiencies between drilling rigs and their corporate office 
the company offers unique business integration services to directly integrate information into business applications that improves accuracy and assists drilling contractors in managing their drilling business 
reports on drilling activities and processes are now provided from the rig site as a part of the drillsuite business solution to assist the drilling contractor in managing their business of drilling 
drillsuite allows contractors to streamline administration by eliminating manual entry of data  
table of contents promotes accurate payroll processing and invoicing  and includes asset tracking and preventive maintenance management through its rigms solution 
the real time information provided also allows the company to advance the drilling process using advanced drilling algorithms and electronic controls such as our wildcat auto drilling system for better execution of the well plan  enhanced rates of penetration  reduced program costs  and improved wellbore quality 
complimenting the company s surface solutions is a portfolio of down hole instrumentation dhi products for both straight hole and directional markets 
key advancements in this area include the introduction of the company s time saving etotco electronic drift recorder  which serves as an electronic equivalent to the traditional mechanical drift tool that helped to launch the company in as a pioneer in down hole electromagnetic em communications for mwd tools  the company serves the market of independent directional drillers with sales and rental business models via its blackstar em mwd group 
the em advantage allows the benefits of mwd operations to be realized for drilling situations where traditional mud pulsed communications are problematic with respect to wellbore quality 
coiled tubing equipment 
coiled tubing consists of flexible steel tubing manufactured in a continuous string and spooled on a reel 
it can extend several thousand feet in length and is run in and out of the wellbore at a high rate of speed by a hydraulically operated coiled tubing unit 
a coiled tubing unit is typically mounted on a truck or skid steel frames on which portable equipment is mounted to facilitate handling with cranes or flatbed trucks and consists of a hydraulically operated tubing reel or drum  an injector head which pushes or pulls the tubing in or out of the wellbore  and various power and control systems 
coiled tubing is typically used with sophisticated pressure control equipment which permits the operator to continue to safely produce the well 
the rig technology group manufactures and sells both coiled tubing units and the ancillary pressure control equipment used in these operations 
through its acquisition of rolligon in late  the company enhanced its portfolio by adding additional pressure pumping and coiled tubing equipment products 
currently  most coiled tubing units are used in well remediation and completion applications 
the company believes that advances in the manufacturing process of coiled tubing  tubing fatigue protection and the capability to manufacture larger diameter and increased wall thickness coiled tubing strings have resulted in increased uses and applications for coiled tubing products 
for example  some well operators are now using coiled tubing in drilling applications such as slim hole re entries of existing wells 
nov engineered and manufactured the first coiled tubing units built specifically for coiled tubing drilling in generally  the rig technology group supplies customers with the equipment and components necessary to use coiled tubing  which the customers typically purchase separately 
the group s coiled tubing product line consists of coiled tubing units  coiled tubing pressure control equipment  pressure pumping equipment  snubbing units which are units that force tubulars into a well when pressure is contained within the wellbore  nitrogen pumping equipment and cementing  stimulation  fracturing and blending equipment 
wireline equipment 
nov s wireline products include wireline drum units  which consist of a spool or drum of wireline cable  mounted in a mobile vehicle or skid  which works in conjunction with a source of power an engine mounted in the vehicle or within a separate power pack skid 
the wireline drum unit is used to spool wireline cable into or out of a well  in order to perform surveys inside the well  sample fluids from the bottom of the well  retrieve or replace components from inside the well  or to perform other well remediation or survey operations 
the wireline used may be slick line  which is conventional steel cable used to convey tools in or out of the well  or electric line  which contains an imbedded single conductor or multi conductor electrical line which permits communication between the surface and electronic instruments attached to the end of the wireline at the bottom of the well 
wireline units are usually used in conjunction with a variety of other pressure control equipment which permit safe access into wells while they are flowing and under pressure at the surface 
the company engineers and manufactures a broad range of pressure control equipment for wireline operations  including wireline blowout preventers  strippers  packers  lubricators and grease injection units 
additionally  the company makes wireline rigging equipment such as mast trucks

the pumps expendables business provides centrifugal  reciprocating  and progressing cavity pumps and pump expendables pumps expendables into the global oil and gas and industrial markets 
tubular coating 
the company develops  manufactures and applies its proprietary tubular coatings  known as tube kote coatings  to new and used tubulars 
tubular coatings help prevent corrosion of tubulars by providing a tough plastic shield to isolate steel from corrosive oilfield fluids such as co 
 h 
s and brine 
delaying or preventing corrosion extends the life of existing tubulars  reduces the frequency of well remediation and reduces expensive interruptions in production 
in addition  coatings are designed to increase the fluid flow rate through tubulars by decreasing or eliminating paraffin and scale build up  which can reduce or block oil flow in producing wells 
the smooth inner surfaces of coated tubulars often increase the fluid through put on certain high rate oil and gas wells by reducing friction and turbulence 
the company s reputation for supplying quality internal coatings is an important factor in its business  since the failure of coatings can lead to expensive production delays and premature tubular failure 
in  nov created a owned joint venture in china with the huabei petroleum administration bureau  which coats chinese produced drill pipe using nov s proprietary coatings 
in  the joint venture opened a second coating plant in jiangyin city  china 
tubular inspection 
newly manufactured pipe sometimes contains serious defects that are not detected at the mill 
in addition  pipe can be damaged in transit and during handling prior to use at the well site 
as a result  exploration and production companies often have new tubulars inspected before they are placed in service to reduce the risk of tubular failures during drilling  completion  or production of oil and gas wells 
used tubulars are inspected by the company to detect service induced flaws after the tubulars are removed from operation 
used drill pipe and used tubing inspection programs allow operators to replace defective lengths  thereby prolonging the life of the remaining pipe and saving the customer the cost of unnecessary tubular replacements and expenses related to tubular failures 
tubular inspection services employ all major non destructive inspection techniques  including electromagnetic  ultrasonic  magnetic flux leakage and gamma ray 
these inspection services are provided both by mobile units which work at the wellhead as used tubing is removed from a well  and at fixed site tubular inspection locations 
the group provides an ultrasonic inspection service for detecting potential fatigue cracks in the end area of used drill pipe  the portion of the pipe that traditionally has been the most difficult to inspect 
tubular inspection facilities also offer a wide range of related services  such as api thread inspection  ring and plug gauging  and a 
table of contents complete line of reclamation services necessary to return tubulars to useful service  including tubular cleaning and straightening  hydrostatic testing and re threading 
in addition  the company applies hardbanding material to drill pipe  to enhance its wear characteristics and reduce downhole casing wear as a result of the drilling process 
in  the company introduced its proprietary line of hardbanding material  tcs 
the group also cleans  straightens  inspects and coats sucker rods at facilities throughout the western hemisphere 
additionally  new sucker rods are inspected before they are placed into service  to avoid premature failure  which can cause the oil well operator to have to pull and replace the sucker rod 
mill systems and sales

its primary purpose is to connect the above surface drilling rig to the drill bit 
a drilling rig will typically have an inventory of  to  feet of drill pipe depending on the size and service requirements of the rig 
joints of drill pipe are connected to each other with a welded on tool joint to form what is commonly referred to as the drill string or drill stem 
when a drilling rig is operating  motors mounted on the rig rotate the drill pipe and drill bit 
in addition to connecting the drilling rig to the drill bit  drill pipe provides a mechanism to steer the drill bit and serves as a conduit for drilling fluids and cuttings 
drill pipe is a capital good that can be used for the drilling of multiple wells 
once a well is completed  the drill pipe may be used again in drilling another well until the drill pipe becomes damaged or wears out 
in recent years  the depth and complexity of the wells our customers drill  as well as the specifications and requirements of the drill pipe they purchase  have substantially increased 
a majority of the drill pipe we sell is required to meet specifications exceeding minimum american petroleum institute api standards 
we offer a broad line of premium drilling products designed for the offshore  international and domestic drilling markets 
our premium drilling products include our proprietary lines of xt and turbotorque tm connections and inch drill pipe that delivers hydraulic performance superior to standard inch drill pipe and weight benefits superior to standard inch drill pipe 
drill collars are used in the drilling process to place weight on the drill bit for better control and penetration 
drill collars are located directly above the drill bit and are manufactured from a solid steel bar to provide necessary weight 
heavyweight drill pipe is a thick walled seamless tubular product that is less rigid than a drill collar 
heavyweight drill pipe provides a gradual transition between the heavier drill collar and the lighter drill pipe 
we also provide subs  pup joints short and odd sized tubular products and other drill stem accessories 
these products all perform special functions within the drill string as part of the drilling process 
intelliserv 
the company provides well site data transmission services 
intelliserv s core product  the intelliserv network  was commercialized in february and incorporates various proprietary mechanical and electrical components into our premium drilling tubulars to allow bi directional data transfer via the drill string 
this network functions at speeds several orders of magnitude higher than current mud pulse and electromagnetic transmission systems and will potentially deliver significant improvements in drilling efficiency and well placement 
intelliserv began its commercial operations in last quarter of and offers its products and services on a rental basis to oil and gas operators

in addition to producing green tubes  vat produces seamless tubular products for the octg market and non octg products used in the automotive  petrochemical  construction  mining  tunneling and transportation industries 
fiberglass composite tubulars 
when compared to conventional carbon steel and even corrosion resistant alloys  resin impregnated fiberglass and other modern plastic composites often exhibit superior resistance to corrosion 
some producers manage the corrosive fluids sometimes found in oil and gas fields by utilizing composite or fiberglass tubing  casing and line pipe in the operations of their fields 
in  the company acquired fiber glass systems  a leading provider of high pressure fiberglass tubulars used in oilfield applications  to further serve the tubular corrosion prevention needs of its customers 
fiber glass systems has manufactured fiberglass pipe since under the name star  and was the first manufacturer of high pressure fiberglass pipe to be 
table of contents licensed by the api in through acquisitions and investments in technologies  the company has extended its fiberglass and composite tubing offering into industrial and marine applications  in addition to its oilfield market 
coiled tubing 
coiled tubing provides a number of significant functional advantages over the principal alternatives of conventional drill pipe and workover pipe 
coiled tubing allows faster tripping  since the coiled tubing can be reeled quickly on and off a drum and in and out of a wellbore 
in addition  the small size of the coiled tubing unit compared to an average workover rig or drilling rig reduces preparation time at the well site 
coiled tubing permits a variety of workover and other operations to be performed without having to pull the existing production tubing from the well and allows ease of operation in horizontal or highly deviated wells 
thus  operations using coiled tubing can be performed much more quickly and  in many instances  at a significantly lower cost 
finally  use of coiled tubing generally allows continuous production of the well  eliminating the need to temporarily stop the flow of hydrocarbons 
as a result  the economics of a workover are improved because the well can continue to produce hydrocarbons and thus produce revenues while the well treatments are occurring 
continuous production also reduces the risk of formation damage which can occur when the flow of fluids is stopped or isolated 
under normal operating conditions  the coiled tubing string must be replaced every three to four months 
nov designs  manufactures  and sells coiled tubing under the quality tubing brand name at its mill in houston  texas 
downhole tools 
the company designs  manufacturers and services a wide array of downhole motors used in straight hole  directional  slim hole  and coiled tubing drilling applications

this business also maintains a wide variety of motor power sections  including its proprietary rotors and stators marketed under the brand name mono monoflo  which it incorporates into its own motors and also sells to third parties 
downhole drilling motors utilize hydraulic horsepower from the drilling fluid pumped down the drill stem to develop torque at the bit 
motors are capable of achieving higher rotary velocities than can generally be achieved using conventional surface rotary equipment 
motors are often used in conjunction with high speed pdc bits to improve rates of penetration 
the downhole tools group also manufactures and sells drilling jars and fishing tools  which are marketed under the griffith tm and bowen brand names 
drilling jars are placed in the drill string  where they can be used to generate a sudden  jarring motion to free the drill string should it become stuck in the wellbore during the drilling process 
this jarring motion is generated using hydraulic and or mechanical force provided at the surface 
in the event that a portion of the drill string becomes stuck and cannot be jarred loose  fishing tools are run into the wellbore on the end of the drill string to retrieve the portion that is stuck

seasonal nature of the company s business historically  the level of some of the company s businesses has followed seasonal trends to some degree 
in general the rig technology group has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuation although orders for new equipment may be modestly affected by holiday schedules 
there can be no guarantee that seasonal effects will not influence future sales in this segment 
in canada  the petroleum services supplies segment has typically realized high first quarter activity levels  as operators take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas 
in past years  certain canadian businesses within petroleum services supplies and distribution services have declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions 
table of contents which resulted in thawing  softer ground  difficulty accessing drill sites  and road bans that curtailed drilling activity canadian breakup 
however  these businesses have typically rebounded in the third and fourth quarter 
petroleum services supplies activity in both the us and canada sometimes increases during the third quarter and then peaks in the fourth quarter as operators spend the remaining drilling and or production capital budgets for that year 
petroleum services supplies revenues in the rocky mountain region sometimes decline in the late fourth quarter or early first quarter due to harsh winter weather 
the segment s fiberglass and composite tubulars business in china has typically declined in the first quarter due to the impact of weather on manufacturing and installation operations  and due to business slow downs associated with the chinese new year

raw materials the company believes that materials and components used in its servicing and manufacturing operations and purchased for sales are generally available from multiple sources 
the prices paid by the company for its raw materials may be affected by  among other things  energy  steel and other commodity prices  tariffs and duties on imported materials  and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company experienced higher steel prices and greater difficulty securing necessary steel supplies in and than it experienced during the preceding several years 
in and  the price for mild steel and standard grades stabilized while specialty alloy prices continued to rise driven primarily by escalation in the price of the alloying agents 
however  toward the end of  the company began to see price escalations in all grades of steel that continued into during  steel prices stabilized and the company began to experience some declines in steel prices late in the year 
the company has generally been successful in its effort to mitigate the financial impact of higher raw materials costs on its operations by applying surcharges to and adjusting prices on the products it sells 
furthermore  nov continued to expand its supply base in  and throughout the world to address our 
table of contents customers needs 
higher prices and lower availability of steel and other raw material the company uses in its business may adversely impact future periods

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to other information contained or incorporated by reference herein 
realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
we are dependent upon the level of activity in the oil and gas industry  which is volatile 
the oil and gas industry historically has experienced significant volatility 
demand for our services and products depends primarily upon the number of oil rigs in operation  the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of these wells  the volume of production  the number of well completions  capital expenditures of other oilfield service companies and the level of workover activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states and canada 
the willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures to explore for and produce oil and natural gas and the willingness of oilfield service companies to invest in capital equipment will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control  including the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  to maintain price stability through voluntary production limits  the level of production by non opec countries and worldwide demand for oil and gas  level of production from known reserves  cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas  level of drilling activity and drilling rig dayrates  worldwide economic activity  national government political requirements  development of alternate energy sources  and environmental regulations 
if there is a significant reduction in demand for drilling services  in cash flows of drilling contractors  well servicing companies  or production companies or in drilling or well servicing rig utilization rates  then demand for the products and services of the company will decline 

table of contents volatile oil and gas prices affect demand for our products 
oil and gas prices have been volatile since in general  oil prices approximated per barrel from through  experienced a decline into the low teens in and  and have generally ranged between per barrel since in  oil prices were extremely volatile oil prices rose to per barrel in july only to fall into the per barrel range in december spot gas prices generally ranged between per mmbtu of gas from through  then experienced severe spikes into the range in and absent occasional spikes and dips due to imbalances in supply and demand  prices have generally ranged between per mmbtu during the last two years 
in  spot gas prices continued to be extremely volatile 
expectations for future oil and gas prices cause many shifts in the strategies and expenditure levels of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors  particularly with respect to decisions to purchase major capital equipment of the type we manufacture 
oil and gas prices  which are determined by the marketplace  may fall below a range that is acceptable to our customers  which could reduce demand for our products 
worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 
recent events have paralyzed credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis 
most economists foresee a slow and uncertain recovery of credit markets  given the current global recession 
the slowdown in worldwide economic activity caused by the global recession has reduced demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
furthermore  many of our customers access the credit markets to finance their oil and natural gas drilling activity 
if the recent crisis and recession reduce the availability of credit to our customers  they may reduce their drilling and production expenditures  thereby decreasing demand for our products and services 
any such reduction in spending by our customers could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
there are risks associated with certain contracts for our drilling equipment 
as of december   we had a backlog of approximately billion of drilling equipment to be manufactured  assembled  tested and delivered by our rig technology group 
the following factors  in addition to others not listed  could reduce our margins on these contracts  adversely affect our position in the market or subject us to contractual penalties our failure to adequately estimate costs for making this drilling equipment  our inability to deliver equipment that meets contracted technical requirements  our inability to maintain our quality standards during the design and manufacturing process  our inability to secure parts made by third party vendors at reasonable costs and within required timeframes  unexpected increases in the costs of raw materials  and our inability to manage unexpected delays due to weather  shipyard access  labor shortages or other factors beyond our control 
the company s existing contracts for rig equipment carry significant down payment and progress billing terms favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects and generally do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience 
however  unfavorable market conditions or financial difficulties experienced by our customers may result in cancellation of contracts or the delay or abandonment of projects 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
competition in our industry could ultimately lead to lower revenues and earnings 
the oilfield products and services industry is highly competitive 
we compete with national  regional and foreign competitors in each of our current major product lines 
certain of these competitors may have greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than us  and may be in a better competitive position 
the following competitive actions can each affect our revenues and earnings price changes  
table of contents new product and technology introductions  and improvements in availability and delivery 
in addition  certain foreign jurisdictions and government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies or regulations which may give local nationals in these countries competitive advantages 
competition in our industry could lead to lower revenues and earnings 
we have aggressively expanded our businesses and intend to maintain an aggressive growth strategy 
we have aggressively expanded and grown our businesses during the past several years  through acquisitions and investment in internal growth 
we anticipate that we will continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy but we cannot assure you that attractive acquisitions will be available to us at reasonable prices or at all 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own or that our management will be able to manage effectively the increased size of the company or operate any new lines of business 
any inability on the part of management to integrate and manage acquired businesses and their assumed liabilities could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
in addition  we may need to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
future acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense  increased interest expense  increased financial leverage or decreased operating income for the company  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
our operating results have fluctuated during recent years and these fluctuations may continue 
we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results in the past 
we cannot assure that we will realize earnings growth or that earnings in any particular quarter will not fall short of either a prior fiscal quarter or investors expectations 
the following factors  in addition to others not listed  may affect our quarterly operating results in the future fluctuations in the oil and gas industry  competition  the ability to service the debt obligations of the company  the ability to identify strategic acquisitions at reasonable prices  the ability to manage and control operating costs of the company  fluctuations in political and economic conditions in the united states and abroad  and the ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
there are risks associated with our presence in international markets  including political or economic instability  currency restrictions  and trade and economic sanctions 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from operations outside the united states based on revenue destination 
our foreign operations include significant operations in canada  europe  the middle east  africa  southeast asia  south america and other international markets 
our revenues and operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries  including uncertain political and economic environments  which may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies  or are subject to governmental policies  giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority owned by local nationals 
as a result of these policies  we may rely on joint ventures  license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries 
in addition  political considerations may disrupt the commercial relationships between us and government owned petroleum companies 
our operations outside the united states could also expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations 
the us department of justice doj  the us securities and exchange commission and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of trading sanctions laws  the foreign corrupt practices act and other federal statutes 
under trading sanctions laws  the doj may seek to impose modifications to business practices  including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries  and modifications to compliance programs  which may increase compliance costs 
if any of the risks described above materialize  it could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we have received federal grand jury subpoenas requesting records related to our exports to and other activities in certain countries 
we are cooperating fully with agents from the us department of commerce  bureau of industry and security  in responding to the subpoenas 
based on available information  we cannot predict what effect the subpoenas or any resulting government action may have on our financial position or results of operations 
the results of our operations are subject to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we earn revenues  pay expenses and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar  including the canadian dollar  the euro  the british pound sterling and the norwegian krone 
approximately of our revenue was derived from sales outside the united states 
because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars  we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period 
thus  increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other currencies in which our operations are conducted will affect our revenues and operating income 
because of the geographic diversity of our operations  weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time 
we also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency exchange fluctuations 
we had forward contracts with a notional amount of  million with a fair value of million as of december  to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we are also subject to risks that the counterparties to these contracts fail to meet the terms of our foreign currency contracts 
we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates would not affect our financial results 
an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets could reduce our earnings 
the company has approximately billion of goodwill and billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives on its consolidated balance sheet as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require the company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include but are not limited to a significant reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or drilling  a significant reduction in profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling contractors  a significant reduction in worldwide well remediation activity  a significant reduction in capital investment by other oilfield service companies  or a significant increase in worldwide inventories of oil or gas 
the timing and magnitude of any goodwill impairment charge  which could be material  would depend on the timing and severity of the event or events triggering the charge and would require a high degree of management judgment 
if we were to determine that any of our remaining balance of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets was impaired  we would record an immediate charge to earnings with a corresponding reduction in stockholders equity  resulting in an increase in balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization 
see additional discussion on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in critical accounting estimates of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with any of the numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies that govern environmental protection  zoning and other matters applicable to our businesses 
our businesses are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies governing environmental protection  zoning and other matters 
these laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional changes in the future 
if existing regulatory requirements change  we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures 
we cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations 
governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
under these circumstances  we might be required to reduce or cease operations or conduct site remediation or other corrective action which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
our businesses expose us to potential environmental liability 
our businesses expose us to the risk that harmful substances may escape into the environment  which could result in personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
our current and past activities  as well as the activities of our former divisions and subsidiaries  could result in our facing substantial environmental  regulatory and other liabilities 
these could include the costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations 
these liabilities could also be imposed on the basis of one or more of the following theories 
table of contents negligence  strict liability  breach of contract with customers  or as a result of our contractual agreement to indemnify our customers in the normal course of business  which is normally the case 
we may not have adequate insurance for potential environmental liabilities 
while we maintain liability insurance  this insurance is subject to coverage limits 
in addition  certain policies do not provide coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination 
we face the following risks with respect to our insurance coverage we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies  or the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
even a partially uninsured claim  if successful and of significant size  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

the device combines a spinning wrench  torque wrench  and backup wrenches 
beam pump surface pump that raises and lowers sucker rods continually  so as to operate a downhole pump 
bit the cutting or boring element used in drilling oil and gas wells 
the bit consists of a cutting element and a circulating element 
the cutting element is steel teeth  tungsten carbide buttons  industrial diamonds  or polycrystalline diamonds pdcs 
these teeth  buttons  or diamonds penetrate and gouge or scrape the formation to remove it 
the circulating element permits the passage of drilling fluid and utilizes the hydraulic force of the fluid stream to improve drilling rates 
in rotary drilling  several drill collars are joined to the bottom end of the drill pipe column  and the bit is attached to the end of the drill collars 
drill collars provide weight on the bit to keep it in firm contact with the bottom of the hole 
most bits used in rotary drilling are roller cone bits  but diamond bits are also used extensively

the reel is an integral part of the coiled tubing unit  which consists of several devices that ensure the tubing can be safely and efficiently inserted into the well from the surface 
because tubing can be lowered into a well without having to make up joints of tubing  running coiled tubing into the well is faster and less expensive than running conventional tubing 
rapid advances in the use of coiled tubing make it a popular way in which to run tubing into and out of a well 
also called reeled tubing 
cuttings fragments of rock dislodged by the bit and brought to the surface in the drilling mud

table of contents kelly bushing a special device placed around the kelly that mates with the kelly flats and fits into the master bushing of the rotary table 
the kelly bushing is designed so that the kelly is free to move up or down through it 
the bottom of the bushing may be shaped to fit the opening in the master bushing or it may have pins that fit into the master bushing 
in either case  when the kelly bushing is inserted into the master bushing and the master bushing is turned  the kelly bushing also turns 
since the kelly bushing fits onto the kelly  the kelly turns  and since the kelly is made up to the drill stem  the drill stem turns 
also called the drive bushing 
kelly spinner a pneumatically operated device mounted on top of the kelly that  when actuated  causes the kelly to turn or spin 
it is useful when the kelly or a joint of pipe attached to it must be spun up  that is  rotated rapidly for being made up 
kick an entry of water  gas  oil  or other formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling 
it occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled 
if prompt action is not taken to control the kick  or kill the well  a blowout may occur 
making up to assemble and join parts to form a complete unit eg  to make up a string of drill pipe 
to screw together two threaded pieces 
compare break out

riser pipe the pipe and special fitting used on floating offshore drilling rigs to established a seal between the top of the wellbore  which is on the ocean floor  and the drilling equipment located above the surface of the water 
a riser pipe serves as a guide for the drill stem from the drilling vessel to the wellhead and as a conductor or drilling fluid from the well to the vessel 
the riser consists of several sections of pipe and includes special devices to compensate for any movement of the drilling rig caused by waves 
also called marine riser pipe  riser joint 

table of contents rotary table the principal piece of equipment in the rotary table assembly  a turning device used to impart rotational power to the drill stem while permitting vertical movement of the pipe for rotary drilling 
the master bushing fits inside the opening of the rotary table  it turns the kelly bushing  which permits vertical movement of the kelly while the stem is turning 
rotating blowout preventer rotating head a sealing device used to close off the annular space around the kelly in drilling with pressure at the surface  usually installed above the main blowout preventers 
a rotating head makes it possible to drill ahead even when there is pressure in the annulus that the weight of the drilling fluid is not overcoming  the head prevents the well from blowing out 
it is used mainly in the drilling of formations that have low permeability 
the rate of penetration through such formations is usually rapid 
safety clamps a clamp placed very tightly around a drill collar that is suspended in the rotary table by drill collar slips 
should the slips fail  the clamp is too large to go through the opening in the rotary table and therefore prevents the drill collar string from falling into the hole 
also called drill collar clamp 
shaker see shale shaker shale shaker a piece of drilling rig equipment that uses a vibrating screen to remove cuttings from the circulating fluid in rotary drilling operations 
the size of the openings in the screen should be selected carefully to be the smallest size possible to allow per cent flow of the fluid 
also called a shaker 
slim hole completions slim hole drilling drilling in which the size of the hole is smaller than the conventional hole diameter for a given depth 
this decrease in hole size enables the operator to run smaller casing  thereby lessening the cost of completion 
slips wedge shaped pieces of metal with serrated inserts dies or other gripping elements  such as serrated buttons  that suspend the drill pipe or drill collars in the master bushing of the rotary table when it is necessary to disconnect the drill stem from the kelly or from the top drive unit s drive shaft 
rotary slips fit around the drill pipe and wedge against the master bushing to support the pipe 
drill collar slips fit around a drill collar and wedge against the master bushing to support the drill collar

table of contents executive summary national oilwell varco generated earnings of billion or per fully diluted share in  on revenues of billion 
earnings per share increased percent and revenue increased percent from the company s earnings and revenues  respectively  due in part to our acquisition of grant prideco  inc  discussed below 
operating income was billion or percent of sales for the year  including charges of million before tax or per share after tax related to the acquisition 
excluding these transaction related charges earnings would have been per diluted share for the year  an increase of percent 
grant prideco acquisition on april  the company completed its acquisition of grant prideco  inc for a combination of approximately billion in cash and the issuance of million shares of national oilwell varco common stock 
the grant prideco merger further strengthened national oilwell varco s position as manufacturer to the oilfield 
its drill bits and reamers are being integrated into the company s offering of drilling motors  non magnetic drill collars  jars and shock tools  to complement its comprehensive package of bottomhole assembly tools used to drill complex wellpaths 
additionally  grant prideco s drillpipe products are purchased and consumed by the company s existing drilling contractor customer base 
the company believes that consumption of drillpipe per foot of hole drilled  or per rig running  has been increasing due to the rising complexity of wellpath designs 
overall the acquisition better positioned national oilwell varco to capitalize on continued application of horizontal  directional and extended reach drilling  through both drillpipe and drill bit product sales 
integration of the business has proceeded well 
the company is introducing new drillpipe tracking products  and expanding oem drillpipe repair and maintenance offerings through its worldwide network of pipe service operations 
the company is also consolidating of a number of bit and downhole tool sales facilities worldwide  and leveraging combined manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
oil gas equipment and services market worldwide developed economies turned down sharply late in as looming housing related asset write downs at major financial institutions paralyzed credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis 
major central banks are responding vigorously  but credit and financial markets have not yet recovered  and a credit driven worldwide economic recession is in full force 
asset and commodity prices  including oil and gas prices  have declined sharply 
after rising steadily for six years to peak at around per barrel in july  oil prices collapsed back to the to per barrel range recently 
higher oil and gas prices over the past several years have led to high levels of exploration and development drilling in many oil and gas basins around the globe  but this is slowing  at least in the near term 
the count of rigs actively drilling in the us as measured by baker hughes a good measure of the level of oilfield activity and spending peaked at  rigs on september   but has decreased to  rigs as of february   as a result of the lower commodity prices and tight credit 
many oil and gas operators reliant on external financing to fund their drilling programs are curtailing some of their drilling activity in view of tighter credit markets and lower commodity prices 
so far this appears to be having the greatest impact on gas drilling across north america 
most international activity is driven by oil exploration and production by national oil companies  which has historically been less susceptible to short term commodity price swings 
therefore we expect international drilling activity to be less impacted by the credit crisis  but the international rig count may show some declines nonetheless 
the company believes its petroleum services supplies segment and its distribution services segment will be affected by a drilling downturn first and most acutely  while the company s rig technology segment would largely be less impacted in the short term owing to its high level of backlog 
recent downturns follow an extended period of high drilling activity which fueled strong demand for oilfield services since incremental drilling activity through the upswing shifted toward harsh environments  employing increasingly sophisticated technology to find and produce reserves 
higher utilization of drilling rigs has tested the capability of the world s fleet of rigs  much of which is old and of limited capability 
technology has advanced significantly since most of the existing rig fleet was built 
the industry invested little during the late s and s on new drilling equipment  but drilling technology progressed steadily nonetheless  as the company and its competitors continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling 
as a consequence  the safety  reliability  and efficiency of new  modern rigs surpass the performance of most of the older rigs at work today 
drilling rigs are now being pushed to drill deeper wells  more complex wells  highly deviated wells and horizontal wells  tasks which require larger rigs with more capabilities 
the drilling process effectively consumes the mechanical components of a rig  which wear out and need periodic repair or replacement 
this process has been accelerated by very high rig utilization and wellbore complexity 
drilling consumes rigs  more complex and challenging drilling consumes rigs faster 
the industry responded by launching many new rig construction projects since  to retool the existing fleet of jackup rigs of the existing jackup rigs are more than years old  to replace older mechanical and dc electric land rigs with improved ac power  electronic controls  automatic pipe handling and rapid rigup and rigdown technology  and to build out additional ultradeep floating drilling rigs  including semisubmersibles and drillships  to employ recent advancements in deepwater drilling to exploit unexplored deepwater basins 
we believe that the newer rigs offer considerably higher efficiency  safety  and capability  and that many will effectively replace a portion of the existing fleet 
as a result of these trends the company s rig technology segment grew 
table of contents its backlog of capital equipment orders from billion at march   to billion at december  however  as a result of the credit crisis and slowing drilling activity  the backlog declined six percent from its third quarter peak of billion 
this was the first decline since national oilwell and varco merged in the company expects the backlog to decline during as revenue out of backlog is likely to exceed inbound new orders 
the land rig backlog comprised percent and equipment destined for offshore operations comprised percent of the total backlog as of december  equipment destined for international markets totaled percent of the backlog 
the company believes that its existing contracts for rig equipment are strong in that they carry significant down payment and progress billing terms favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects  and generally do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience 
for this reason we do not expect the credit crisis or softer market conditions to result in material cancelations of contracts or abandonment of major projects  however  there can be no assurance that such discontinuance of projects will not occur  particularly if the credit crisis or economic downturn deepens significantly 
segment performance rig technology generated billion in revenue and billion in operating profit in  yielding an operating margin of 
the group generated percent operating leverage or flowthrough the increase in operating profit divided by the increase in revenue on percent revenue growth from as of december  the scheduled outflow of revenue from backlog is expected to be in the range of billion per quarter in  or billion for the full year 
non backlog revenue for the segment totaled billion or percent of the segment total for from through the end of  the segment has delivered a total of newly built offshore rigs 
the petroleum services supplies segment generated revenues of billion and operating profit of billion in  which included only a partial year contribution from the acquired grant prideco businesses 
on an adjusted basis for a full year contribution of grant prideco  inc  including estimated fixed asset and intangible asset stepup impact but excluding transaction charges and inventory step up amortization  the segment generated billion in revenue and billion in operating profit  yielding an operating margin of percent 
operating profit leverage or flowthrough from  on the same adjusted basis  was percent on six percent sales growth 
north america accounted for approximately percent of petroleum services supplies segment revenues during the year 
distribution services segment revenues were billion during  an increase of percent from the prior year 
operating profit was million or percent of sales  and operating profit leverage or flowthrough was percent from the prior year 
the us accounted for about percent of the segment s revenues overall  and canadian sales accounted for about percent of the mix 
international sales benefitted from a number of expansion initiatives in new geographic markets undertaken in and prior  and total international sales were approximately percent of the mix in included in these initiatives were the company s unique rig store concept 
outlook the recent emergence of a serious banking crisis  a global recession  and lower commodity prices are presenting increasingly challenging prospects to our business 
consequently we are cautious in our outlook for  and believe we will see orders for new rigs fall by half or more in drilling activity  particularly by independent gas producers reliant on external financing  will likely continue to decline through at least the first half of the year 
as a result our outlook for the company s petroleum services supplies segment and distribution services segment remains very guarded 
we expect revenues for both groups to decline sharply in the first quarter  due mostly to north american drilling activity declines  and we are uncertain when they may recover to prior levels 
decremental leverage for both groups is expected to be above our long term estimated levels percent for petroleum services supplies  percent for distribution services due to rising pricing pressure we are experiencing  particularly in north america 
our outlook for international markets  which are more driven by national oil company activity  are historically less volatile and expected to see better market conditions 
the rig technology segment is expected to be less affected by the downturn due to the strength of its backlog 
the company is nevertheless well positioned to manage through this uncertain period  and should benefit from its strong balance sheet and capitalization  access to credit  and a high level of contracted orders which are expected to continue to generate good earnings well into the downturn 
the company has a long history of cost control and downsizing in response to depressed market conditions  and of executing strategic acquisitions during difficult periods 
steel prices have begun to decline in many areas  and the company is reducing outsourcing  overtime  and discretionary expenditures in view of the market 
such a period may present opportunities to the company to effect new organic growth and acquisition initiatives  and we remain hopeful that a downturn will generate new opportunities

distribution services revenue from distribution services totaled  million  an increase of million from the prior period 
the number of drilling rigs actively searching for oil and gas is a key metric for this business segment 
worldwide rig count increased in compared to  with increases of  and in canada  international and the us rig activity  respectively 
the company s distribution services segment continued efforts to expand in international markets resulted in a increase in international revenue 
the expansion primarily consisted of opening rig stores or facilities that maintain levels of consumables used on rigs  in centrally located areas

worldwide rig count increased in compared to  with increases of and in the us and international rig activity  offset almost entirely by a decline in canada rig activity 
the company s distribution services segment efforts to expand in international markets along with the increasing international market activity resulted in a increase in international revenue

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  million  and total debt of million 
at december   cash and cash equivalents were  million and total debt was million

these negative cash flows were offset by net income of  million  an increase in billings in excess of costs of million and non cash charges of million 
receivables increased due to greater revenue in compared to as the fourth quarter revenue was  million compared to  million for the fourth quarter of inventory increased due to continued higher activity and growing backlog orders

at december   the company had  million of available funds under its two revolving credit facilities 
we also believe increases in capital expenditures caused by any need to increase manufacturing capacity can be funded from operations or through debt financing 
a summary of the company s outstanding contractual obligations at december  is as follows in millions payment due by period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations total debt operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments standby letters of credit as of december   the company had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits  see note  income tax  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents we intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates  but the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
the company expects to reduce its capital spending approximately in to the million range 
we expect to fund future cash acquisitions and capital spending primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings  including the unborrowed portion of the credit facility or new debt issuances  but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us 
inflation has had an impact on certain of our operations in recent years 
we believe that the higher costs for energy  steel and other commodities experienced in have largely been mitigated by increased prices and component surcharges for the products we sell 
however  higher steel  labor  energy or other commodity prices may adversely impact future periods 
critical accounting estimates in preparing the financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long term construction contracts  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  impairments of long lived assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and income taxes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
revenue recognition under long term construction contracts the company uses the percentage of completion method to account for certain long term construction contracts in the rig technology group 
these long term construction contracts include the following characteristics the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications  the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts  and construction projects often have progress payments 
this method requires the company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project  progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date  all of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin the company recognizes in each reporting period 
the company prepares detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project  taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin 
significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least quarterly by senior management 
factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access  weather  production efficiencies  availability and costs of labor  materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in risk factors 
these factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the company s estimates and materially impact the company s future reported earnings 
historically  the company s estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues and gross profits on percentage of completion contracts 
based upon an analysis of percentage of completion contracts for all open contracts outstanding at december  and  adjustments representing the differences between the estimated and actual results to all outstanding contracts resulted in net changes to gross profit margins of million on billion of outstanding contracts and million on billion of outstanding contracts  respectively 
while the company believes that its estimates on outstanding contracts at december  and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage of completion accounting  the factors identified in the preceding paragraph could result in significant adjustments in future periods 
the company has recorded revenue on outstanding contracts on a contract to date basis of billion at december  allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from customer accounts requires the company to make judgments regarding future events and trends 
allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the company s portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis 
this process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience  current aging status of the customer accounts  and financial condition of the company s customers 
based on a review of these factors  the company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable portfolio as a whole 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues come from international oil companies  international shipyards  international oilfield service 
table of contents companies  and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
therefore  the company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions 
if worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate  the creditworthiness of the company s customers could also deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these receivables  and additional allowances could be required 
at december  and  allowance for bad debts totaled million and million  or and of gross accounts receivable  respectively 
historically  the company s charge offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  because of the risk factors mentioned above  changes in our estimates could become material in future periods 
inventory reserves inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand  assumptions about future demand and market conditions  and estimates about potential alternative uses  which are usually limited 
the company s inventory consists of specialized spare parts  work in process  and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the company s large installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the oilfield 
customers rely on the company to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner 
the company s estimated carrying value of inventory therefore depends upon demand driven by oil and gas drilling and well remediation activity  which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
at december  and  inventory reserves totaled and of gross inventory  respectively 
while inventory reserves and accruals have not had a material impact on the company s financial results for the periods covered in this report  changes in worldwide oil and gas activity  or the development of new technologies which make older drilling technologies obsolete  could require the company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory 
such changes in our estimates could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives 
the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
we estimate the fair value of these intangible and fixed assets using an income approach 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
the forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our income forecast as well as our weighted average cost of capital  both key assumptions used in our calculation 
changes to these assumptions  including  but not limited to further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts  further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas  significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers  higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity  or any other significant adverse economic news could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
due to further significant declines in the company s stock price and oil and gas commodity prices  coupled with unprecedented turbulence in the credit markets  the company determined a triggering event occurred in the fourth quarter of we performed an impairment analysis at december  which did not result in an impairment charge 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the company has approximately billion of goodwill and billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives on its consolidated balance sheet as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require the company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include  but not limited to further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts  further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas  significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers  higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity 
the timing and magnitude of any goodwill impairment charge  which could be material  would depend on the timing and severity of the event or events triggering the charge and would require a high degree of management judgment 
the company performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the annual impairment tests are performed during the fourth quarter of each year 
if it is determined that goodwill is impaired the impairment is measured based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if the company encounters events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill and identified intangibles has been impaired 
fair value of the reporting units is determined based on internal management estimates  forecasts and judgments  using a combination of three methods discounted cash flow  comparable companies  and representative transactions 
while the company primarily uses the discounted cash flow method to assess fair value  the company uses the comparable companies and representative transaction methods to validate the discounted cash flow analysis and further support management s expectations where possible 
the discounted cash flow is based on management s short term and long term forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit 
the two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment which bears the risk of change and could impact the company s goodwill impairment analysis include the cash flow from operations from each of the company s individual business units and the weighted average costs of capital for the discount rate 
the starting point for each of the fourteen reporting unit s cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan 
the detailed planning process takes into consideration a multitude of factors including worldwide rig activity  inflationary forces  pricing strategies  customer analysis  operational issues  competitor analysis  capital spending requirements  working capital needs  customer needs to replacing aging equipment  increased complexity of drilling  new technology  and existing backlog among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections 
cash flows beyond the specific operating plans were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short term or long term trend 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of and in the early stages of  both commodity prices and rig activity dropped significantly and as a result  projections for the remainder of also reflected substantial declines compared to the company updated its operating plans and discounted cash flows based on this information 
the goodwill impairment analysis which we performed during the fourth quarter of and updated as of december   did not result in an impairment in the current year 
the company had no impairment of goodwill for the years ended december  and the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the projected results and goodwill impairment analysis assuming revenue for each individual reporting unit decreased an additional from the current projections for each of the next three years   and  while holding all other factors constant  and no goodwill impairment was identified for any of the reporting units 
the company believes that such a drop approximately corresponds to a three year worldwide average rig count in the range of  to  active drilling rigs  a level of activity last seen approximately five years ago 
the worldwide rig count has been volatile  is reasonably likely to continue to be so in the future  and has varied from a low of  rigs in to a high of  rigs in in worldwide rig activity averaged  active rigs 
additionally  if the company were to increase their discount rate basis points  while keeping all other assumptions constant  there would be no impairments in any of the reporting units 
inherent in our projections are key assumptions relative to how long the current downward cycle might last 
while we believe these assumptions are reasonable and appropriate  we will continue to monitor these  and update our impairment analysis if the cycle downturn continues for longer than expected 
while the company does not believe that these events or changes are likely to occur  it is reasonably possible these events could transpire if market conditions worsen and if the market fails to recover in and or any significant changes to these assumptions and factors could have a material impact on the company s goodwill impairment analysis 
other indefinite lived intangible assets  representing trade names management intends to use indefinitely  were valued and are tested for impairment using the relief from royalty method  a form of the income approach 
an impairment is measured and recognized based on the amount the book value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds its calculated fair value as of the date of the impairment test 
included in the impairment test are assumptions  for each trade name  regarding the related revenue streams attributable to the trade names  the royalty rate  and the discount rate applied 
based on the company s indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of  the company had no impairment of other indefinite lived intangible assets for the years ended december  and if any of the above assumptions change  including in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our trade name s estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the projected results and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment assuming revenue for each individual trade name decreased an additional from the current projections for each of the next three years   and  while holding all other factors constant  and a pre tax non cash impairment charge of approximately million would be incurred under those assumptions 
if the discount rate applied to the fair value calculation increased by basis points  and all other assumptions remained constant  a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of approximately million would be incurred under those assumptions 
income taxes the company is a us registered company and is subject to income taxes in the us the company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world 
income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the company operates and income is earned 
the company s annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year 
the company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation  which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries 

table of contents the company maintains liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
the annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the company considers appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain tax credits which may not be ultimately sustained 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means 
the company is subject to audits by federal  state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments 
the company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is an interpretation of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year  the effect will be recognized in the period of the event 
the company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized 
income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the company s valuation allowances 
the realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income 
any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings 
the company has not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
should the company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  the company may be required to record additional taxes 
unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the company makes an annual determination whether to permanently reinvest these earnings 
if  as a result of these reassessments  the company distributes these earnings in the future  additional tax liability would result  offset by any available foreign tax credits 
the company does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
additional information concerning each of these matters follows foreign currency exchange rates we have extensive operations in foreign countries 
the net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency 
these operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency  which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that do impact income 
during the years ended december   and  the company reported foreign currency gains losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
the gains losses were primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the foreign exchange gain is primarily the result in the weakening of the following major currencies of which the company has material exposure against the us dollar british pound sterling  canadian dollar  euro and the norwegian krone 
further weakening of these currencies against the us dollar may continue to create similar gains in future periods to the extent we maintain net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the above currencies as their functional currency 
certain revenues in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those us dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency 
similarly  some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies  but have associated us dollar costs  which also gives rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
in order to mitigate that risk  we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs 
we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had entered into foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating  million to hedge cash flow exposure to foreign currency exchange risk of forecasted or firm commitments 
these exposures arise when local currency operating expenses are not in balance with local currency revenue collections 
based on quoted market prices as of december  and for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates  we have recorded a gain loss of million and million  respectively  to adjust these foreign currency forward contracts to their fair market value of million and million respectively 
this loss is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet 
it is expected that million of the loss will be reclassified into earnings within the next months with an offset by gains from the underlying transactions resulting in no impact to earnings or cash flow 
at december   the company has cash flow hedges in place through the second quarter of a gain loss from ineffectiveness of million and million is included in earnings related to these foreign currency contracts for the years ending december  and respectively 
ineffectiveness for was not material 
at december   the company had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating million designated and qualifying as fair value hedges to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange risk of firm commitments 
based on quoted market prices as of december  and for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates  we recorded a gain loss of million and million  respectively  to adjust these foreign currency forward contracts to their fair market value of million and million  respectively 
this loss is offset by designated gains on the firm commitments 
ineffectiveness for  and was not material 
at december   the company had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating million to offset exposures to foreign currency exchange risk of nonfunctional currency balance sheet accounts  primarily consisting of account receivables and account payables  and are not designated as hedges 
therefore  changes in the fair value million for and million for of these contracts are recorded each period in current earnings 
on january   the company settled the net investment hedges with notional amounts aggregating  million by delivering norwegian kroner and receiving us dollars 
the related cumulative tax effected gain of million was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss

these market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities 
the company estimates that a hypothetical movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on these financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by million 
the counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions 
the credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis 
in the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract  our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential 
we assess the functional currencies of our operating units to ensure that the appropriate currencies are utilized in accordance with the guidance of sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
effective january   we changed the functional currency of our rig technology unit in norway from the norwegian krone to the us dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which they operate 
this change was precipitated by significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances  including the increased order rate for large drilling platforms and components technology  the use of our norway unit as our preferred project manager of these projects  increasing revenue and cost base in us dollars  and the implementation of an international cash pool denominated in us dollars 
as a norwegian krone functional unit  norway was subject to increasing foreign currency exchange risk as a result of these changes in its economic environment and was dependent upon significant hedging transactions to offset its non functional currency positions 
at december   our norway operations had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating  million with a fair value of million to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk against the us dollar  our reporting currency 
effective with the change in the functional currency  the company terminated these hedges 
the related net gain position of million associated with the terminated hedges has been deferred and is being recognized into earnings in the future period s the forecasted transactions affect earnings  of which million has been recognized into earnings at december  the company has subsequent to january   entered into new hedges to cover the exposures as a result of the changes to us dollar functional 
at december   our norway operations had derivatives with  million in notional value with a fair value of million  included in the table above 

table of contents interest rate risk at december   our long term borrowings consisted million of senior notes  million of senior notes  million of senior notes  million of senior notes and million of senior notes 
we had million of other borrowings at december  we occasionally have borrowings under our other credit facilities  and a portion of these borrowings could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements 
these instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from either libor  nibor or euribor  or at the prime interest rate 
under our credit facilities  we may  at our option  fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over libor  nibor or euribor for days to months 
our objective is to maintain a portion of our debt in variable rate borrowings for the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings 
on february   we settled and terminated our three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million associated with our senior notes 
under this agreement  we received interest at a fixed rate of and pay interest at a floating rate of six month libor plus a weighted average spread of approximately 
the swap agreements originally entered into by varco were recorded at their fair market value at the date of the merger and no longer qualify as effective hedges under fas the swaps have been marked to market for periods subsequent to the merger and any change in their value has been reported as an adjustment to interest expense 
the change in the fair market value of the interest swap agreements resulted in a million increase in interest expense for the period ended december
