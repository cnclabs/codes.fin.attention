item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance  and to a limited extent annuities  to middle income households throughout the united states 
we view our operations by segments  which are the major insurance product lines of life  health  and annuities  and the investment segment that supports the product lines 
segments are aligned based on their common characteristics  comparability of the profit margins  and management techniques used to operate each segment 
insurance product line segments 
as fully described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the product line segments involve the marketing  underwriting  and benefit administration of policies 
each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies 
each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market 
whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole  or the individual distribution units within the segment  the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin  which is premium revenue less policy obligations policy acquisition costs and commissions investment segment 
the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources  including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity 
our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income  which is net investment income less interest credited to net policy liabilities financing costs the tables in note business segments reconcile torchmark s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three year period ending december  additionally  this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year to year comparability and which reconciles to net income 
that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark s operations on a segment by segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 
summary of operations net income declined million or to million in on a diluted per share basis  net income declined to 
the primary cause for the decline was after tax realized investment losses of million million before tax 
these losses were due mostly to writedowns of fixed maturity securities issued by lehman brothers and washington mutual 
in  net income grew or million over the prior year to million 
on a per share basis  net income grew to 
per share earnings growth exceeded the growth in dollar earnings in both periods as a result of our share repurchase program discussed later under this caption 
life insurance was our strongest performing segment in both years  contributing million to pretax growth and million to growth 
margin improvements in this segment were a result of premium growth and lower obligation ratios in both periods 
the investment segment also contributed to the growth in pretax income in each year  rising million in and million in excess investment income  measuring the profit of the investment segment  was benefited by reduced financing costs and growth in the size of the investment portfolio in both years 
the growth in excess investment income was attained even though significant cash flow has been used to buy torchmark stock in all three periods 
in  the contributions to growth in our life insurance and investment segments were more than offset by declines in our annuity and health segments 
our annuity underwriting loss was million  compared with gains of million in and million in in  declines in equity markets have caused variable policyholder account values to decline  guaranteed minimum death benefit costs to increase  policyholders to withdraw funds  and changes in actuarial assumptions all of which have resulted in the underwriting losses 
we do not emphasize this segment and have discontinued the sale of variable annuities in  only offering a fixed annuity product 
health insurance underwriting margin improved million to million in  but declined or million in to million 
this

index to financial statements segment has experienced increased competition in recent periods  especially in  which has caused a decline in agent count resulting in a significant reduction in new sales 
total revenues declined in to billion 
in  total revenues rose to billion from billion in life premium rose million in and million in  while net investment income rose million in and million in growth in these two revenue components accounted for the increase in revenues 
however  revenues were negatively affected by the aforementioned pretax realized loss of million and a decline in health premium of million  described further under this caption 
life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december   rising in to billion and also in margins as a percentage of premium have also increased slightly each year to of premium in and from in life net sales rose in to million  after having declined slightly in the two preceding years 
net sales rose in each of the three major life distribution channels in life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption life insurance 
we market three primary health insurance products under age limited benefit health insurance  medicare supplement insurance  and the medicare part d prescription drug benefit 
health premium declined in to billion from billion in health premium was flat in with the primary factor in the decline was the decline in agent count in our united american branch office during the year  our largest health producer 
this agency has experienced intense competition  which has resulted in a significant decrease in new health sales and has negatively impacted premium income 
efforts are underway to rebuild this agency 
prior to  this agency had been instrumental in the growth in the sales of our limited benefit health product  as demand for this product had increased 
accordingly  premium from the limited benefit product has grown significantly in relation to medicare supplement premium in recent years 
while medicare supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium  increased competition has also dampened sales of this product resulting in premium declines in each successive year 
also  was our third year of offering medicare part d insurance 
as most of the country s part d enrollees selected a plan provider in  we do not expect growth in our part d business going forward 
see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 
while we still offer fixed annuities  we do not emphasize sales of annuity products  favoring life insurance instead 
see the caption annuities for further discussion of the annuity segment 
as previously mentioned  the investment segment s pretax profitability  or excess investment income  increased million in and million in it had declined in the previous year 
this segment benefited from lower financing costs in each successive year 
in  these costs declined primarily due to lower rates and a lower average balance on our short term debt 
in  our interest expense on funded debt declined due to the refinancing of the two funded debt issues noted below 
prior to  the average yield on new investments acquired had been lower than the average portfolio yield  restricting growth in net investment income in relation to the size of the portfolio 
in  however  the yield on new investments exceeded the portfolio yield by basis points 
growth in total investment income has been negatively affected by torchmark s share repurchase program described later under this caption  which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments 
management believes that the acquisition of torchmark stock at favorable prices provides a superior return on available cash 
torchmark s current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investment grade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives 
approximately of our invested assets at fair value consists of fixed maturities of which was investment grade at december  the average quality rating of the portfolio was bbb 
the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alt a mortgages  no residential mortgages  no counterparty risks  no credit default swaps  or derivative contracts 
see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and note investments in the notes to consolidated statements of operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as mentioned earlier in this summary  we wrote down certain fixed maturities and equities during  including bonds issued by lehman brothers  washington mutual  and various other institutions in the pretax amount of million 
the write downs were taken as these securities met our criteria for other than temporary impairment 
these writedowns compared with million taken in and none in please refer to note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption other than temporary impairments for more information on these writedowns and our criteria for consideration of other than temporary impairment

realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and may have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
under the caption realized gains and losses in this report  we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses including the writedowns 
also  as explained in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments 
during the second quarter of  we issued two new debt securities in separate public offerings our trust preferred securities  redemption amount million and our senior notes  par value million 
these offerings essentially provided funding for the repayment of two existing debt instruments in the fourth quarter of the call of our trust preferred securities at a redemption price of million and the maturity of our senior notes  par value million 
more information on these transactions can be found in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 
in each of the years through  net income was affected by certain significant  unusual  and nonrecurring nonoperating items 
we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations 
a discussion of these items follows 
as reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption litigation and tax settlements  we have been involved in a number of litigation issues over the course of the three year period through in which we either received settlements net of expenses or incurred settlement losses and expenses 
these issues resulted in after tax charges of thousand in  thousand in  and an after tax benefit of million in additionally  as described under the same caption of note  we received tax settlements in each year in the amounts of million in  million in  and million in all of these litigation and tax issues pertained to issues arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations 
legal expenses and litigation items pertaining to current operations are included in either insurance administrative expenses or parent expenses  as appropriate  in our segment analysis 
as explained in note investments under the caption other than temporary impairments  we wrote down certain company occupied property to fair value during the write down resulted in an after tax charge of million 
in  liberty began a program to dispose of its agency office buildings  replacing them with rental facilities 
in  buildings were sold for gross proceeds of million and a pre tax gain of million 
in  additional buildings were sold for proceeds of million and a pretax gain of million million after tax 
the program began to wind down in as five buildings were sold for proceeds of thousand and a pretax gain of thousand thousand after tax 
four buildings remained to be sold at december  because of the significant scale of this nonoperating activity  we have removed million million after tax from our core results representing the gain in and the gains on the sales in and

index to financial statements torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in and was reaffirmed at its october  board of director s meeting 
with no specified authorization amount  we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company s excess cash flow  general market conditions  and other alternative uses 
the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable 
additionally  when stock options are exercised  proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises 
the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december  analysis of share purchases amounts in thousands purchases shares amount shares amount shares amount excess cash flow and borrowings option proceeds total throughout the remainder of this discussion  share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings 
a discussion of each of torchmark s segments follows 
life insurance 
life insurance is our largest insurance segment  with life premium representing of total premium 
life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented of the total in additionally  investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 
life insurance premium rose to billion in after having increased in to billion 
life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels 
premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency other agencies we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term annualized premium in force  net sales  and first year collected premium 
annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any 
table of contents 
index to financial statements given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve month period 
annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue 
net sales is annualized premium issued  net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue  except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired 
we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued 
first year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year 
first year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur  and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december   an increase of over billion a year earlier 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december  the following table shows net sales information for each of the last three years by distribution method 
life insurance net sales by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency other agencies the table below discloses first year collected life premium by distribution channel 
life insurance first year collected premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency other agencies direct response is our leading writer of life insurance 
the direct response operation consists of two primary components direct mail and insert media 
direct mail targets primarily young middle income households with children 
the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product 
not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales  but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders 
parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population 
also  both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 
at this time  we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance 
we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response s premier markets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements insert media  which targets primarily the adult market  involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media  such as coupon packets  newspapers  bank statements  and billings 
this media was historically placed by direct marketing and advertising distributors  inc dmad  previously an unrelated entity with which we have had a business relationship for over fifteen years 
we acquired dmad in january  for million  and integrated their operations during this acquisition allowed the company to expand marketing opportunities through increased solicitation volume and also improve margins through cost savings in the insert media component 
the direct response operation accounted for of our life insurance premium during  the largest of any distribution group 
direct response s share of total life premium has risen steadily in each of the last three years as illustrated in the chart above 
life premium for this channel rose in both and net sales rose in to million after a decline in to million 
first year collected premium increased in to million after a decline in the american income exclusive agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions  but also on credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
life premium for this agency rose to million in  after having also increased in net sales increased in to million from million in net sales rose in first year collected premium rose in to million  after having increased in as in the case of all of torchmark s agency distribution systems  continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count 
growth in the agent count has contributed to the improvements in sales in this agency 
the american income agent count was  at december  compared with  a year earlier  an increase of 
the agent count rose in from  at year end this agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business 
additionally  the systematic  centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents 
the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets its life products to primarily middle income customers in southeastern states 
liberty s life premium declined in both and compared with the respective prior year 
liberty s life premium sales  in terms of net sales  were million in  representing an increase of in net sales had declined in first year collected premium increased in to million  after having declined in growth in the liberty agency s sales and premium volume are highly dependent on building the size of its agency force 
liberty has implemented initiatives similar to those of american income to recruit new agents  primarily through the use of the internet 
the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
liberty s agent count rose to  at december  from  a year earlier 
this compared with an increase of in but a decline of in most of the growth in the agent count occurred in the latter half of the year 
as new agents become trained and more seasoned  they are expected to become more productive 
the growth in net sales is attributable to the growth in the agent counts in and the latter part of  while the decline in net sales was a result of the decline in agent counts in and early in  the liberty national agency began the reorganization of its marketing leadership and restructured its agent compensation system to provide greater reward to productive agents and to establish production minimums for agents 
these changes led to terminations and resignations during of agents not meeting these production minimums 
however  management believes that these changes will result in a more productive agency over the long term 
management also believes these changes are responsible for recent margin improvements 
a larger and more productive agency force should lead to increased sales  which in turn should result in increased premium growth 
we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the united investors agency  the military agency  the united american independent and branch office agencies  and other small miscellaneous sales agencies 
the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business 
united investors represented of torchmark s life premium income 
the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and

the united american independent and branch office agencies combined represented approximately of torchmark s total life premium

margin improvements in both and were primarily the result of premium growth  but favorable mortality was also a positive factor 
this improvement in mortality is not expected to be a trend 
an important factor in the increase was that american income s obligation ratios decreased from to 
additionally  the proportion of american income premium to total premium has grown each year  and that has caused life margins to increase because that agency s margins are torchmark s highest  well exceeding in all periods

index to financial statements health insurance 
health products sold by torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limited benefit hospital surgical plans  cancer  and accident plans sold to people under age we also sell medicare supplements to enrollees in the federal medicare program  as well as providing coverage under the medicare part d prescription drug program beginning january  health premium represented of torchmark s total premium income in excluding part d premium  health premium represented in  compared with in and in health underwriting margin  excluding part d  accounted for of the total in  compared with in and in these declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment 
health results have also been negatively affected by increased competition in recent periods

this risk sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims  and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis 
we market supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels with the two united american agencies being our market leaders 
over the past several years  we have placed greater emphasis on the sale of limited benefit health insurance products to under age consumers rather than medicare supplement insurance as customer demand for the limited benefit hospital surgical 
table of contents 
index to financial statements plans has increased and price competition and lesser demand for medicare supplements has dampened the sales of that product 
while medicare supplement still remains our largest health product in terms of premium income  the proportion of premium from other limited benefit health products has grown steadily over the past few years

the united american branch office and independent agencies 
as discussed above  the two united american ua agencies have emphasized sales of individual supplemental limited benefit health plans known generally as hospital surgical plans marketed to under age customers for which demand has increased in recent years 
these plans generally provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined  a fixed amount surgical schedule  out patient coverage  and other miscellaneous hospital related charges 
they also contain caps on total per illness benefits 
consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual major medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers 
minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limited benefit plans are generally lower than those of medicare supplement  however  the medicare supplement product has historically had slightly higher persistency rates  resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium 
both of the ua agencies offer these limited benefit plans 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the ua branch office is an exclusive agency  meaning the agents in its offices nationwide sell only for us 
in recent years  this agency has focused its efforts on sales of limited benefit products  and has been successful in building the sales of these plans replacing the decline in medicare supplement sales 
in  the ua branch office represented of torchmark s non medicare part d sales 
beginning in late and throughout  this agency has experienced increased agent turnover and a decline in agent count due to increased competition in the sales of health products 
as a result  sales and premium at the ua branch office declined in as is the case with all of our captive agencies  growing the agency size translates into increased sales and premium growth 
after growing very rapidly in periods prior to mid  the producing agent count in the ua branch office has declined since that time 
at year end  the producing agent count was  compared with  at the end of and  at december  these declines in agent count have resulted in the declines in net sales and premium growth shown in the charts above  especially in efforts are underway to rebuild this agency 
going forward  we are shifting the emphasis in the ua branch office agency to life and health products currently marketed by liberty national agents 
these products are priced to achieve higher profit margins and have better persistency than ua s limited benefit health insurance 
we will continue to offer the current product portfolio  but the majority of our financial incentives will be used to encourage agents to sell the liberty national product line 
we believe this will improve the stability and profitability of the ua branch office agency 
the ua independent agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large  multi state organizations down to one person offices 
all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies  of which  were active producing agents for torchmark at december  this agency is our largest carrier of medicare supplement insurance  with million or of our medicare supplement premium income in overall  this agency s contribution to torchmark s total health sales and premium has declined in each of the past three years  as a result of the increased competition in medicare supplement sales 
health premium for the ua independent agency declined to million in  after declining in the declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses 
the liberty national exclusive agency  predominantly a life insurance distribution channel  is the third largest writer of torchmark health business based on premium collected 
cancer supplemental plans are the type of limited benefit health products primarily produced by this agency 
liberty is our only distribution channel for which cancer insurance is its primary health product 
liberty s health premium declined in to million after a drop in several factors have contributed to the decline in health premium in this agency 
most notable has been the increased emphasis on sales of the higher margin life products at liberty 
another factor  prior to  was the decline in agent count discussed earlier under the caption life insurance as a result of the change in the agent compensation system in to improve persistency and margins 
however  recruiting and training initiatives have resulted in a significant increase in the liberty agent count in additionally  there was a settlement of a class action lawsuit in early concerning a closed block of cancer business over the timing and size of the premium rate increases on this block 
this block represented approximately half of liberty s cancer business at that time and approximately at year end prior to the settlement  significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on this block resulted in higher health premium  but increasing claims continued to reduce underwriting margins 
the settlement provided for reduced benefits paid going forward and further required liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business 
net health sales in the liberty agency rose to million  compared with net health sales of million 
net health sales had declined from sales of million 
american income exclusive agency  also predominantly a life insurance distribution channel  is our fourth largest health insurance distributor based on premium collected 
its health plans are comprised of various limited benefit plans for which approximately of the agency s health premium was from accident policies 
sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 
health premium at this agency rose in to million  after having increased to million in net health sales were million in  compared with million in and million in net health sales comprised less than of the american income agency s total net sales in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements direct response  primarily a life operation  also offers health insurance  which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups 
in  net health sales were million  comprising less than of direct response s total life and health net sales 
direct response health net sales and premium income have risen each year over the prior year 
net sales increased in and in health premium rose in both and  increasing to million in medicare part d 
torchmark  through its subsidiary united american  began offering insurance coverage under the government s medicare part d plan as of january  the medicare part d plan is a stand alone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries 
part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american  unlike the traditional medicare program for hospital and doctor services  where cms is the primary insurer and private medicare supplement insurers are secondary insurers 
the program generally calls for cms to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium 
total medicare part d premium was million in  compared with million in and million in the decline in part d premium resulted from the decline in the number of enrollees 
enrollment for all part d coverages ends on december of the previous year  except for enrollees who reach age in the current year 
at december   united american had approximately thousand enrollees for the part d plan  compared with thousand for the plan year 
although final enrollment has not been confirmed  we do not expect a significant increase in enrollees for the plan year 
our medicare part d product is sold primarily through the direct response operation  but is also sold by the two ua agencies 
part d net sales were million in and million in  compared with million in we count only sales to new first time enrollees in net sales and was the first year the medicare part d program was in effect 
the majority of and premium income was from previous enrollees 
we believe that the medicare part d program is an excellent addition to our health product offerings because of our experience with the senior age market and with medicare supplements  the government assurances with regard to the risk sharing agreements for participating insurers  the incremental income added to our health insurance margins  and the renewal of the business every year 
due to our experience with service to the senior age market and the use of our existing direct response marketing system  entry to this business required little new investment 
however  we do not expect growth in the part d product in the near future  as most medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a plan in additionally  as with any government sponsored program  the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market

annuities 
fixed annuity products are sold on a limited basis by our subsidiaries 
variable annuities were sold prior to but new sales were discontinued during the year 
annuities represented less than of torchmark s premium revenue 
we do not emphasize this segment  and annuities continue to diminish in relation to our other operations 
annuity deposit balances dollar amounts in thousands at december  fixed variable balances in separate accounts declines in equity markets during have had a significant effect on the variable policyholder account balance  as they have resulted in declines in value in the underlying investments and increased policyholder withdrawals 
the decline in the size of the annuity account balance has had a negative impact on annuity underwriting income 
an analysis of underwriting income is as follows 
annuities summary of results dollar amounts in thousands at december  policy charges policy obligations required interest on reserves net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes amortization of acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense underwriting income attributable to fixed annuities variable annuities insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense a significant portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements 
this spread sometimes results in negative net policy obligations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements annuities generate earnings from periodic policy fees and charges to the account balances  reduced by net policy obligations and acquisition costs 
policy charges and underwriting margins have declined in each of the periods presented  primarily due to the declines in our variable annuity business 
because policy charge revenues for variable annuities are based on the size of the policyholder s account value  policy charges have declined each period as declining equity markets  voluntary terminations  and lower sales have resulted in decreases in the variable account balance  especially in in addition to the revenue declines  underwriting income for the variable product has been negatively affected by two other factors 
first  we have guaranteed minimum death benefits to variable policyholders providing that a certain minimum death benefit will be payable to them regardless of the policyholders account value upon death 
for this reason  we provide a reserve for this benefit for which the cost increases as the policyholder s account value declines 
this reserve is subject to the periodic review of underlying assumptions and a revision or unlocking when experience so indicates 
in  the additional charge to policy obligation expense from unlocking was million  compared with reduced expense of million in and million in the other factor is that the deferred acquisition cost asset with regard to variable annuities is also subject to the unlocking of assumptions 
because of the variable account balance decline  future revenues and profits on variable business would also be expected to decline 
this unlocking of assumptions resulted in a net charge of million in  compared with charges of million in and 
million in without these unlocking adjustments  variable underwriting income would have been million in of revenue  compared with million of revenue in and million of revenue in the unamortized deferred acquisition cost balance was million at december  compared with million at year end if equity markets do not stabilize  we could see higher amortization of acquisition costs in the future 
the variable annuity business is our only business where margins are significantly impacted by changes in equity markets 
while the fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year  policy charges have remained steady and underwriting income has declined slightly each year 
the stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist of surrender charges and are not based on account size 
these charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods 
a significant portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements  which can result in negative net policy obligations 
however  this investment income spread has declined in each year  resulting in the decline in underwriting income

the increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses and medicare part d administrative expense 
one factor in the higher legal expense was the affirmation of an earlier jury verdict in insurance claim litigation in the amount of million 
medicare part d administrative expenses were lower in both and than in because open enrollment remained in effect in until may  causing us to incur additional administrative expenses in that year 
open enrollments for the and plan years were closed on december of the respective prior year 
salaries  particularly in  were favorably impacted by the previously mentioned changes to liberty national s agent compensation system 
while these changes resulted in reductions in agent salaries and related employee costs of approximately million in compared with  new initiatives have resulted in an increase in these costs in of approximately million over management believes that these salary reductions could be replaced by higher deferred acquisition costs going forward  however  as the compensation system changes emphasize a commission based agent compensation system rather than salaries 
commissions on new product sales are deferred and amortized over the premium paying life of the business 
management believes that pension cost will increase approximately million in  as a result of the impact that declining financial markets have had on pension funding 
parent company expense rose thousand or in and million or in included in and expenses were charges in the amount of million in and million in for expenses incurred related to potential acquisition bids that were not successful 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as mentioned in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we settled litigation in prior periods relating to issues occurring many years ago  but incurred million in legal costs in and thousand in as previously noted  we do not consider the costs of settling litigation applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations 
stock compensation expense rose in because was the first year after adoption of the accounting rule requiring the expensing of stock options where we had three years of annual employee grants being expensed  and 
the employee grant was fully vested in before adoption and there was no grant in new restricted stock grants in each of the three years through  which generally vest over five years  have also contributed to the increases in and stock compensation expense 
management believes that it is highly unlikely that stock compensation expense will increase materially in or over the near term 
as stated in note business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense  and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 
as described in note investments under the caption other than temporary impairments  we wrote down certain company occupied real estate because it met our criteria as described in that note for other than temporary impairment 
as a result  we incurred a pretax charge of million which is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
investments 
we manage our capital resources including investments  debt  and cash flow through the investment segment 
excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations 
it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment 
it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding  representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company 
since implementing our share repurchase program in  we have used billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives 
share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest bearing assets  but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding 
in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis  we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment

per share excess investment income increased in and in the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income  which rose to million in it increased to million in from million in as presented in the following chart  the growth in net investment income in both periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets 
growth in net investment income growth in mean invested assets at amortized cost the lower growth in income is reflective of new investments that have been made in recent years at long term yields lower than the portfolio s average yield  resulting from the lower rates available in financial markets in those periods 
however  as noted under the caption investment acquisitions below  we did acquire billion in fixed maturities in yielding basis points higher than the average portfolio yield for the first time in several years 
in each year through  new acquisitions were made at lower yields than the yields on securities disposed of  contributing to the lower growth in income relative to the portfolio growth 
another factor limiting the growth in net investment income relative to average assets in was the purchase of million of tax exempt municipal securities 
yields available on municipal bonds are lower  but produce significant tax savings to the company 
also contributing to the lower growth in yields in recent years were calls on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio  as the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities 
given the sizeable annual cash flow from our operations  we expect mean invested assets to continue to grow  but if rates available for new investments do not exceed our portfolio yield  the rate of growth of investment income will lag the growth in assets 
more detailed information about investment acquisitions follows under the caption investment acquisitions 
excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt 
information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table

for more specific information on life and health crediting rates  please refer to note future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs 
financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income

analysis of financing costs amounts in thousands interest on funded debt interest on short term debt other reclassification of interest due to deconsolidation subtotal of interest expense benefit from interest rate swaps financing costs financing costs declined million or in they declined million or in the decline resulted from a decrease in short term interest rates during  as well as a decline in our average commercial paper balance for the year to million 
the primary factor in the decrease was the refinancing in of two of our funded debt issues 
our senior notes million principal amount matured and our trust preferred securities million redemption value were called in the fourth quarter of these repayments were essentially funded by the issuance of two new instruments in the second quarter of  our senior notes million principal amount and our trust preferred securities million principal amount 
because the new issues were offered several months before the other securities were repaid  interest on funded debt increased million 
it should be noted  however  that we invested the proceeds of the new offerings and the investment income from those proceeds offset the increased financing costs  having little impact on excess investment income 
partially offsetting the decline in interest on funded debt in was an increase in interest on short term debt 
while higher short term rates were a factor  the primary cause of the increase was a higher average balance of our commercial paper outstanding in  which rose to million 

table of contents 
index to financial statements prior to  we entered into several interest rate swap agreements  in which we exchanged our fixed interest commitments for floating rate commitments 
in the low interest environment experienced in the past several years  these swaps provided us with a considerable spread between our actual interest cost and what our fixed interest cost would have been 
however  as rates began to rise in and  we began to dispose of these instruments in and had disposed of all remaining swap instruments as of the second quarter of the benefit of the swaps in reduced our financing costs in that year by thousand 
more information concerning the debt offerings  repayments  and swaps is disclosed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
excess investment income benefits from increases in long term rates available on new investments and decreases in short term borrowing rates 
of these two factors  higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short term rates 
investment acquisitions 
torchmark s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investment grade fixed maturities with long maturities maturity date more than years after acquisition date that meet our quality and yield objectives 
we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long term nature of our policy liabilities 
we believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable 
if such longer term securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives  new money is invested short term  with maturities less than five years 
during calendar years through  torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities  primarily corporate securities 
there were no below investment grade securities acquired 
investment grade corporate securities include both bonds and trust preferred securities which are classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases 
the effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield 
this date is commonly known as the worst call date 
for noncallable bonds  the worst call date is always the maturity date 
for callable bonds  the worst call date is the call date that produces the lowest yield or the maturity date  if the yield calculated to the maturity date is lower than the yield calculated to each call date 
two different average life calculations are shown  average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date

we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a make whole basis prior to maturity 
we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so 
for investments in callable bonds  the actual life of the investment will depend on whether or not and if so  when the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date 
given our investments in callable bonds  the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment 
we do know that the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity 
data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 
prior to  we generally did not invest in securities with maturity dates more than years after the acquisition date 
because of the changing investment environment during and  we invested some funds in fixed maturity securities bonds  trust preferred securities and redeemable preferred stocks with longer scheduled maturity dates 
in virtually all cases  such securities have a scheduled maturity date and are callable many years prior to the scheduled maturity date 
due primarily to this increase in these longer term securities  the average life of funds invested during and to both next call and maturity is significantly higher than that of investments during new cash flow available to us for investment has been affected by issuer calls as a result of the low interest environment experienced during the past three years 
issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost 
calls increase funds available for investment  but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called 
issuer calls were million in  million in  and million in the level of calls was unusual  and contributed to the significant increase in funds invested in that year

because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities  the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms

approximately million of the increase was attributable to securities for which there was a one step downgrade in the bloomberg composite rating 
more than million of the increase was attributable to securities issued by banks and insurance companies 
as discussed in note investments under the caption fair value measurements  we believe  based on what we have observed in the market  that much of the increase in unrealized losses was attributable to illiquidity in the markets 
this illiquidity has contributed to a spread widening  and accordingly unrealized losses  on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable 
torchmark has the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery

index to financial statements credit risk sensitivity 
credit risk is the level of certainty that a security s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity 
approximately of our fixed maturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities including redeemable preferred and asset backed securities 
as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities  credit risk is a concern 
we mitigate this ongoing risk  in part  by acquiring investment grade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer 
we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis 
we also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors

the balance of the portfolio is spread among issuers in a wide variety of sectors 
gross unrealized losses were billion 
as previously noted  based upon what we have observed in the market  management believes that much of the unrealized loss at december  was attributable to illiquidity in the market  contributing to a spread widening  and accordingly unrealized losses  on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable 
torchmark has the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery 
approximately of the gross unrealized losses were attributable to the financial sector  including attributable to life and health or property casualty insurance companies and attributable to banks 
we are encouraged by the efforts of the federal government to help banks and insurance companies to weather the current financial crisis  but the company cannot predict at this time what impact these efforts will have on ultimate recovery

approximately of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade 
our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alt a mortgages loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower 
we have no direct investments in residential mortgages  nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts 
we do not participate in securities lending 
there are no off balance sheet investments  as all investments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets

the collateral underlying these cdos is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies  but no sub prime or alt a mortgages are included in the collateral 
our current investment policy is to acquire only investment grade obligations 
thus  any increases in below investment grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 
subsequent data as of february  the gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity assets at february  was billion  an increase of million or since december  the decline in fair value of fixed maturities in the financial bank sector accounted for million of the increase in gross unrealized loss 

table of contents 
index to financial statements market risk sensitivity 
torchmark s financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk  meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
since of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixed rate investments  the portfolio is highly subject to market risk 
declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value 
under normal market conditions  we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity 
the long term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio 
the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio 
however  in accordance with gaap  these liabilities are not marked to market 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in basis points at december  at december  realized gains and losses 
our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits  sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future 
in addition to the payment of these benefits  we also incur acquisition costs  administrative expenses  and taxes as a part of insurance operations 
because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods  premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations 
for this reason  we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations 
this portfolio consists primarily of high quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long term insurance product obligations 
as a result  fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities 
expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 
because our investment portfolio is large and diverse  investments are occasionally sold or called  resulting in a realized gain or loss 
these gains and losses occur only incidentally  usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers 
investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments 
we do not engage in trading investments for profit 
therefore  gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield  or which result from events that are beyond our control  are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 
realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations  and as a result  can have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the period to period trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations 
accordingly  they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations 
for these reasons  and in line with industry practice  we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

table of contents 
index to financial statements financial condition liquidity 
liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
our liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations  a portfolio of marketable securities  and a line of credit facility 
the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs 
sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income 
cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments  commissions  administrative expenses  and taxes 
cash inflows from insurance operations significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers  such as torchmark  expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods  sometimes many years later 
an actuarially computed reserve is carried in the financial statements for these future benefits 
earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period  but there is no corresponding cash outlay 
therefore  cash provided from operations is generally expected to exceed net income 
cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of the investment portfolio 
cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements 
available cash flows are also used to repay debt  to buy back torchmark shares  to pay shareholder dividends  and for other corporate uses 
as discussed below under the caption parent company liquidity  the primary source of the cash flows for these purposes is dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries to the parent company 
cash flows provided from operations were million in  million in  and million in in addition  we received million in investment maturities  repayments  and calls in  adding to available cash flows 
such repayments were billion in and million in our cash and short term investments were million at year end and million at year end additionally  we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need 
these securities had a fair value of billion at december  however  our strong cash flows from operations  investment maturities  and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 
parent company liquidity 
an important source of cash flow to the parent company is dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries 
as allowed by insurance regulations  the insurance subsidiaries generally pay dividends to torchmark parent in amounts equal to their prior year earnings calculated on a statutory basis 
these dividends are received in order to meet the parent company s dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on debt of the parent company  and operating expenses of the parent 
in  million in dividends were paid to the parent company  as compared with million in and million in after paying debt obligations  shareholder dividends  and other expenses but before share repurchases  torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in of approximately million 
parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes  such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases 
in  it is expected that the parent company will receive million in dividends from subsidiaries and that a range of million to million will be available as excess cash flow  assuming that our senior debt due in august  is refinanced 
certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends 
for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries  see the restrictions section of note shareholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations 
torchmark qualifies for and is participating in the commercial paper funding facility cpff  a facility created by the federal reserve board to purchase commercial paper from eligible issuers 
torchmark can issue million under the cpff  which was the par amount outstanding at december  book value million 
capital in our insurance subsidiaries is sufficient to support current operations 
as of december   the ratio of regulatory capital to company action level required capital was  in line with recent years 

table of contents 
index to financial statements an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand by letters of credit up to million 
as of december   we had available million on this facility 
for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility  see the commercial paper section of note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as fully described and discussed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt  torchmark had outstanding million par amount trust preferred securities at both december  and the capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders 
the trust is an off balance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules 
deconsolidation is required because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest 
therefore torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity  even though we own all of the entity s voting equity and have guaranteed the entity s performance 
while these liabilities are not on our consolidated balance sheets  they are represented by torchmark s junior subordinated debentures due to the trust 
these junior subordinated debentures were a torchmark liability of million par and book value at both december  and these securities are indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption capital resources in this report 
the preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our interest payment on our debt to the trusts 
as described in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 
as of december   we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities other than as described above 
all of our guarantees  other than the trust preferred guarantee  were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries  as disclosed in note commitments and contingencies 
the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december  amounts in millions actual liability total payments less than one year one to three years four to five years more than five years fixed and determinable funded debt principal funded debt interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations pension obligations uncertain tax positions future insurance obligations total funded debt is itemized in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations 
pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans 
they are offset by invested assets in the trusts  which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the obligations as they become due 
therefore  our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on torchmark s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   these pension obligations were million  but there were also assets of million in the pension entities 
the schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations  except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted 
please refer to note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on pension obligations 
uncertain tax positions do not include million of accrued interest 
see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force and separate account obligations at december  these estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown 
management believes that the assets supporting the liability of billion at december   along with future premiums and investment income  will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations

index to financial statements capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of short term debt the commercial paper facility described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term funded debt  junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities  and shareholders equity 
the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark s capital trust iii which is liable for its trust preferred securities 
in accordance with gaap  these instruments are included in due to affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets 
a complete analysis and description of long term debt issues outstanding is presented in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   the same as a year earlier 
our senior debentures are due in august  at a redemption amount of million plus accrued interest  and are classified as short term debt because they are due within a year 
as a result  reported long term debt at december  was million 
if conditions in financial markets stabilize  we intend to refinance this debt with another issue 
otherwise  we intend to repay the debt with our excess cash flow 
during the second quarter of  we registered and issued two new security offerings our trust preferred securities  offered through torchmark capital trust iii at a redemption value of million less issue expenses  and our senior notes issued for the principal amount of million less issue expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  we redeemed our trust preferred securities and we repaid our senior notes which matured 
the trust preferred securities were redeemed for million plus accrued dividends and our senior notes were repaid in the principal amount of million plus accrued interest 
specific information about the new securities offered and the securities repaid in  including the uses of proceeds and sources of funding  is disclosed and discussed in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
over the past several years  we have entered into swap agreements to exchange the fixed rate commitments on our funded debt for floating rate commitments 
during the low interest rate environment in recent years  these swaps were very beneficial in reducing our interest cost 
however  as short term rates rose in with no meaningful change in long term rates  these swaps became less profitable 
because we believed that the swap settlements could have possibly become unprofitable  we disposed of our two remaining swap agreements during and held no swap agreements after june more information about our swaps is found in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption interest rate swaps 
we believe that the most beneficial use of our excess cash flow could be a strategic acquisition 
however  an acquisition is unlikely until financial markets stabilize 
absent an acquisition  we believe that the best use of excess cash is to buy company stock 
however  we will exercise caution given current economic conditions 
we will not jeopardize our liquidity or debt covenants through our share repurchase program 
as previously mentioned  our board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the stock repurchase program in october  in amounts and timing that management  in consultation with the board  determined to be in the best interest of the company 
we have repurchased common stock every year since  except for  the year following the acquisition of american income 
since the beginning of  we have repurchased million shares at a total cost of billion  and have acquired no fewer than million shares in any one year 
we believe that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings and to return on equity  and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value 
as noted earlier in this report  we acquired over million shares at a cost of million in with excess cash flow 
if the free cash flow used for the repurchase of our common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds  an estimated million of additional investment income  after tax  would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have declined to 
because share purchases were made  actual net income per share was  a lesser decline of 
we intend to continue the repurchase of our common shares when conditions are favorable 
the majority of purchased shares are retired each year 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we maintain a significant available for sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders liabilities 
accounting rule sfas requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period 
the period to period changes in fair value  net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax  are reflected directly in shareholders equity 
changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets 
while sfas requires invested assets to be revalued  accounting rules do not permit interest bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner 
due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders equity  this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders equity 
if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets  the effect on equity would be largely offset 
fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period to period presentation of our shareholders equity  capital structure  and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets 
for this reason  our management  credit rating agencies  lenders  many industry analysts  and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of sfas when analyzing our balance sheet  capital structure  and financial ratios 
the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources 
additionally  the tables present the effect of sfas on relevant line items  so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark s capital structure 
selected financial data at december  at december  at december  gaap effect of sfas gaap effect of sfas gaap effect of sfas fixed maturities millions deferred acquisition costs millions total assets millions short term debt millions long term debt millions shareholders equity millions book value per diluted share debt to capitalization diluted shares outstanding thousands actual shares outstanding thousands amount added to deducted from comprehensive income to produce the stated gaap item includes torchmark s junior subordinated debentures in   and in the amount of million 
torchmark s debt covenants require that the effect of sfas be removed to determine this ratio 
effective in  the fasb issued a new statement sfas  offering an option which  if elected  would permit us to value our interest bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our available for sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income  the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings 
because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt  the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile  causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results 
therefore  we do not intend to elect this option 
as discussed earlier in this report  the fixed maturity portfolio incurred million in net unrealized investment losses in million after tax and adjustments of deferred acquisition costs 
these unrealized losses are believed by management to have been brought on by widening credit spreads in financial markets  and were the primary factor in the decline in our shareholders equity in share purchases in each of the years through were generally offset by net income  having little impact on our total shareholders equity in those periods 
torchmark s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was times in  compared with times in and times in a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report

the credit quality of torchmark s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies 
in  standard poor s affirmed all credit ratings on torchmark and its subsidiaries 
however  it revised its outlook to negative from stable for the company 
standard poor s cited our increased risk within our investment portfolio which has experienced significant unrealized losses concentrated in the financial sector 
they also noted that our share repurchase program has reduced our capitalization  but that we were still well within a level adequate to support their rating 
fitch also revised its outlook to negative during during  standard poor s lowered its credit rating on torchmark s outstanding debt from a to a  and lowered the rating of its preferred stock from a to bbb 
the credit rating change was attributed to weaker agent productivity  recruiting  and retention  as well as changes in direct response strategy  all of which have contributed to lower new sales 
during  am best downgraded torchmark s funded debt one notch from a to a  and its preferred stock from a to bbb 
moody s downgraded our funded debt from a to baa  and our preferred stock from baa to baa both downgrades were to reflect the notching  or widening of rating levels between the insurance companies and their parent company which has issued the debt 
this notching is typical for these rating agencies as they rate other insurance companies 
it does not reflect any change in the creditworthiness of the company

the am best a excellent rating is assigned to those companies which  in its opinion  have demonstrated excellent overall performance when compared to the norms of the life health insurance industry 
a excellent companies have an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 
the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard poor s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics  differing only slightly from those rated higher 
the minus sign shows the relative standing within the major rating category 
the a rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics  somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings

other items litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries 
such punitive damage claims that are tried in alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
additionally  it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi  a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts 
this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case 
based upon information presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material

index to financial statements critical accounting policies future policy benefits 
because of the long term nature of insurance contracts  our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future 
the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry 
the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note future policy benefit reserves 
approximately of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december  are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas  under which the liability is the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits 
the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue 
under sfas  these assumptions are locked in and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts  except where there is a premium deficiency  as defined in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits 
otherwise  variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies 
a premium deficiency event for torchmark s sfas business is very rare  and did not occur during the three years ended december  the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business reported under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments sfas 
under sfas  the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date 
accordingly  there are no assumptions used in the determination of the sfas future policy benefit liability 
deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased 
the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset 
deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales 
additionally  the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption value of insurance purchased as indicated in note deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximately of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december  are accounted for under the provisions of sfas for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the premium paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums 
the projection assumptions for sfas business are set at the time of contract issue 
under sfas  these assumptions are locked in at that time and  except where there is a loss recognition issue  are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts 
absent a premium deficiency  variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume 
we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for our sfas assets for any period in the three years ended december  the remaining portion of deferred acquisition costs pertain to business reported under sfas for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits 
these contracts are not subject to lock in 
under sfas  the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
with the exception of variable annuities  as discussed earlier in this report  revisions related to our sfas assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december  the variable annuity block could sustain further increases in the level of amortization if equity markets do not stabilize 
amortization for sfas blocks other than variable annuities is not expected to have a material impact on operations for the foreseeable future 
policy claims and other benefits payable 
this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
the estimate of unreported 
table of contents 
index to financial statements claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us 
however  the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns 
factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation  the litigation environment  regulatory mandates  and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established 
changes in these estimates  if any  are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made 
we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits  including the estimate of unsubmitted claims  are the most appropriate under the circumstances 
however  there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation 
at this time  we do not expect any change in estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 
revenue recognition 
premium income from our subsidiaries insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected 
however  in accordance with gaap  revenues on limited payment contracts and universal life type contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently 
revenues on limited payment contracts are recognized over the contract period 
premium for deposit balance products  such as our annuity and interest sensitive life policies  is added to the policy account value 
the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability 
this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance  administration  surrender  and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder 
in each case  benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 
we report investment income as revenue  less investment expenses  when it is earned 
our investment activities are integral to our insurance operations 
because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future  the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested 
anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates  contract liabilities  and other product contract features 
these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on our net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in our insurance and annuity products 
for more information concerning revenue recognition  investment accounting  and interest sensitivity  please refer to note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities  investments  and market risk sensitivity in this report 
valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in high quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time 
while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity  they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time  primarily to maintain our investment quality and diversification standards 
we report this portfolio at fair value 
fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction 
the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets  having a greater impact on longer term maturities 
because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio  small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company 
this impact is disclosed in basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report 
however  as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report  we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and  as such  we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 
during  the values of our fixed maturities have also been affected by illiquidity in the financial markets  which has contributed to a spread widening  and accordingly unrealized losses  on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable 
even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale  we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products 
considerable information concerning the policies  procedures  classification levels  and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments are presented in note investments under the caption fair value measurements 
impairment of investments 
we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value  where fair value has declined below carrying value 
while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions  an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary 
the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements impairments of investments are disclosed in note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report 
while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other than temporary impairment  it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 
defined benefit pension plans 
we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full time employees 
we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees 
our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions 
in accordance with gaap  an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time 
these obligations are offset  at least in part  by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 
at december   our net liability under these plans was million 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover  retirement age  the expected return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled 
these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation 
a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation 
a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation 
small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans 
while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions  given the information available from company experience  economic data  independent consultants and other sources  we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected 
our discount rate  rate of return on assets  and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised  if necessary  based on more current information available to us 
note also contains information about pension plan assets  investment policies  and other related data 
cautionary statements we caution readers regarding certain forward looking statements contained in the foregoing discussion and elsewhere in this document  and in any other statements made by us or on our behalf whether or not in future filings with the securities and exchange commission 
any statement that is not a historical fact  or that might otherwise be considered an opinion or projection concerning us or our business  whether express or implied  is meant as and should be considered a forward looking statement 
such statements represent our opinions concerning future operations  strategies  financial results or other developments 
forward looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
if these estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect  the actual results may differ materially from the forward looking statements made on the basis of such estimates or assumptions 
whether or not actual results differ materially from forward looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments  which may be national in scope  related to the insurance industry generally  or applicable to torchmark specifically 
such events or developments could include  but are not necessarily limited to changes in lapse rates and or sales of our insurance policies as well as levels of mortality  morbidity and utilization of healthcare services that differ from our assumptions  federal and state legislative and regulatory developments  particularly those impacting taxes and changes to the federal medicare program that would affect medicare supplement and medicare part d insurance  market trends in the senior aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare  such as health maintenance organizations hmos and other managed care or private plans  and that could affect the sales of traditional medicare supplement insurance
