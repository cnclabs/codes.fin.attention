item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
in the event that our loan customers do not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans  and the collateral securing the repayment of these loans is insufficient  or a ready market is not available  to cover any remaining loan balance  we could experience significant loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets  if any  serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans 
as of december   our allowance for loan losses was million  representing of total loans and of nonperforming loans as of that date 
in determining the amount of our allowance for loan losses  we rely on our loan quality reviews  our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions  among other factors 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio  which may require additions to our allowance 
although we are unaware of any specific problems with our loan portfolio that would require any increase in our allowance at the present time  our allowance for loan losses may need to be increased further in the future due to our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of commercial business and commercial real estate loans 
any material additions to our allowance for loan losses would materially decrease our net income 
in addition  our regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
our concentrations in construction loans  including speculative construction loans  nonresidential real estate loans and land loans may expose us to increased credit risk 
at december   million  or of our total loan portfolio  consisted of construction loans  nonresidential real estate loans and land loans  and million  or of the construction loan portfolio  consisted of speculative construction loans at that date 
speculative construction loans are loans made to builders who have not identified a buyer for the completed property at the time of loan origination 
although our origination of these types of loans has slowed as the local economy has slowed  over time  we intend to continue to emphasize the origination of these loan types 
these loan types expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family mortgage loans because the repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operation or sale of the property and the income stream of the borrowers and such loans typically involve larger balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers 
in addition  many borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us so an adverse development with respect to one loan or credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of non payment and loss 
furthermore  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses through future charges to income as the portfolio of these types of loans grows  which would hurt our earnings 
for more information about the credit risk we face  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management 
noncore funding represents a large component of our funding base 
in addition to the traditional core deposits  such as demand deposit accounts  interest checking  money market savings and certificates of deposits  we utilize several noncore funding sources  such as federal home loan bank of cincinnati advances  federal funds purchased and other sources 
we utilize these noncore funding sources to fund our ongoing operations and growth 
the availability of these noncore funding sources are subject to broad economic conditions and  as such  the pricing on these sources may fluctuate significantly and or be restricted at any point in time  thus impacting our net interest income  our immediate liquidity and or our access to additional liquidity 
in recent months  several fhlb institutions have announced impairment charges relating to mortgage securities and other assets and that their capital positions have deteriorated to the point that they may suspend dividend payments to their members 
we are a member of the fhlb of cincinnati which continues to pay dividends 
however  should financial conditions continue to weaken  certain fhlb institutions including fhlb of cincinnati may have to suspend dividend payments or curtail advances to member institutions 
should the fhlb system deteriorate to the point of not being able to fund future advances to banks  including first federal  this would place increased pressure on other wholesale funding sources 
fluctuations in interest rates may hurt our earnings and asset value 
most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  and thus subject us to significant risks from changes in interest rates 
consequently  our results of operations can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates and our ability to manage interest rate risk 
changes in market interest rates  changes in the relationships between short term and long term market interest rates  or changes in the relationship between different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates earned on interest earning assets differently than the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
this difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income or a decrease in interest rate spread 
in addition to affecting our profitability  changes in interest rates can impact the valuation of our assets and liabilities 
future fdic assessments will hurt our earnings 
in february  the fdic adopted an interim final rule imposing a special assessment on all insured institutions due to recent bank and savings association failures 
the emergency assessment amounts to basis points of insured deposits as of june  the assessment will be collected on september  the special assessment will negatively impact the company s earnings 
if the special assessment had been based on the company s assessable deposits at december   the special assessment would have equaled approximately  in addition  the interim rule would also permit the fdic to impose an emergency special assessment after june   of up to basis points if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance or as a result of deterioration in the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio due to institution failures 
on march   the chairman of the fdic announced that the fdic intends to lower the special assessment from basis points to basis points 
the decrease in the special assessment is contingent upon passage of legislation of the u 
s 
congress 
the assessment rates  including the special assessment  are subject to change at the discretion of the board of directors of the fdic 
any additional emergency special assessment imposed by the fdic will further hurt the company s earnings 
we could be subject to reinvestment risk related to the federal reserve program to purchase mortgage backed securities backed by fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae 
on november   the federal reserve announced that it will initiate a program to purchase billion in direct obligations of fannie mae  freddie mac and the federal home loan banks and billion in mortgage backed securities backed by fannie mae  freddie mac and the government national mortgage association ginnie mae 
the federal reserve stated that its actions are intended to reduce the cost and increase the availability of credit for the purchase of houses  which in turn should support housing markets and foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally 
the purchases of direct obligations began during the first week of december and the purchases of mortgage backed securities began in early january while the federal reserve s program to purchase mortgage backed securities could cause an increase in the price of agency securities  which would positively impact our book value  it could increase call and prepayment risk on callable agencies and mortgage backed securities and the cash flow would be subject to reinvestment risk 
call and prepayment risk are the cash flow risk resulting from the possibility that a bond is redeemed before maturity 
reinvestment risk is the result of the cash flow interest or the payment of principal of a security not being reinvested at a similarly attractive rate of return 
the resulting use of funds could have a negative impact on net interest margin 
our balance sheet leverage transactions are subject to reinvestment and interest rate risks 
on april  we entered into two balance sheet leverage transactions  utilizing structured repurchase agreements  which totaled million 
million of the borrowings have call options ranging from two to three years after origination  with final maturities ranging from five to ten years if they are not called 
collateral for the borrowings consists of u 
s 
agency pass through mortgage backed securities the securities 
borrowing rates as of the report date are substantially lower than when the leverage transaction was originated 
if borrowing rates remain at or near current low levels for two to three years it is possible that the structured repurchase agreement borrowings will not be called and the bank will be paying above market rates for borrowings for an extended period of time 
additionally  the recent decrease in mortgage rates has increased the amount of mortgages being refinanced 
prepayment of the mortgages that are collateral for the securities used in the structured repurchase agreement could require us to substitute additional collateral if the minimum collateral level is not maintained 
the bank may not have suitable collateral in the portfolio to substitute at the time and would have to purchase additional securities at market prices 
additional purchases would likely be reinvested in much lower yielding investments 
both factors discussed here could contribute to a mismatch in terms of the effective duration of both the borrowings and the securities and would negatively impact the anticipated spread on the leverage transaction 
a downturn in the local economy or a decline in real estate values could hurt our profits 
substantially all of our loans are secured by real estate in montgomery county  tennessee  and the surrounding areas 
as a result of this concentration  a downturn in the local economy could significantly increase nonperforming loans  which would hurt our profits 
historically  fort campbell  a nearby us army installation  has played a significant role in the economy of our primary market area 
recently  several thousand troops returned home from deployments to the middle east 
however  we would expect that any future deployments would dampen economic activity 
furthermore  a decline in real estate values could lead to some of our mortgage loans becoming inadequately collateralized  which would expose us to greater risk of loss 
additionally  a decline in real estate values could hurt our portfolio of construction loans  nonresidential real estate loans  and land loans and could reduce our ability to originate such loans 
for a discussion of our primary market area  see item  business market area 
strong competition within our primary market area could hurt our profits and slow growth 
we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
this competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and attract deposits 
price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits  which would reduce net interest income 
competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits 
some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide 
we expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our primary market area 
see item  business market area and business competition for more information about our primary market area and the competition we face 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of thrift supervision  first federal s chartering authority  and by the federal deposit insurance corporation  as insurer of our deposits 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  may have a material impact on our operations 
even though our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq stock market s global market  it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange 
the trading volume in our common stock on the nasdaq global market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the nasdaq global market or other stock exchanges 
because of this  it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of our common stock in the market  or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market  will have on the market price of our common stock 
we can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market  or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market  would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past  and may fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance 
general market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock  and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent market developments in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the us department of treasury the treasury was given the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the secretary of the treasury announced that the treasury would purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts 
under the program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp capital purchase program  the treasury made billion of the capital authorized by the eesa available to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock investments in selected institutions approved for participation in the tarp capital purchase program 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury also received  from participating financial institutions  warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred investment 
participating financial institutions were required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under the tarp capital purchase program 
on november   the company announced that it would not apply for funds available through the tarp capital purchase program 
on november   the board of directors of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic adopted a final rule relating to the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
the tlgp was announced by the fdic on october   preceded by the determination of systemic risk by the secretary of the treasury after consultation with the president  as an initiative to counter the system wide crisis in the nation s financial sector 
under the tlgp the fdic will i guarantee  through the earlier of maturity or june   certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions on or after october  and before june  and ii provide full fdic deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts paying less than interest per annum and interest on lawyers trust accounts iolta accounts held at participating fdic insured institutions through december  coverage under the tlgp was available for the first days without charge 
the fee assessment for coverage of senior unsecured debt ranges from basis points to basis points per annum  depending on the initial maturity of the debt 
the fee assessment for deposit insurance coverage is basis points per quarter on amounts in covered accounts exceeding  on december   first federal and the company elected to participate in the senior unsecured debt guarantee program and first federal elected to participate in the non interest bearing transaction account guarantee program 
the fdic announced on february  that  for an additional premium  the unsecured debt guarantee portion of the tlgp will be extended for an additional four months through october at december   neither the company nor the bank had issued any senior unsecured debt under the tlgp 
on february  the secretary of the treasury announced the creation of the homeowner affordability and stability plan stability plan 
the treasury led an interagency group of federal financial regulators who developed the stability plan the details of which continue to be finalized 
a portion of the stability plan consists of a home loan modification program to commit billion to prevent avoidable foreclosures by reducing monthly payments to qualified homeowners 
the office of thrift supervision has requested that all ots regulated thrifts temporarily suspend foreclosures on owner occupied homes until the stability plan is finalized 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  the stability plan could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
developments at federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac payments on the agency securities in which we invest are guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac 
because of the guarantee and the underwriting standards associated with mortgages underlying agency securities  agency securities historically have had high stability in value and been considered to present low credit risk 
the recent turmoil in the residential mortgage sector  however  and concerns over the financial condition of fannie mae and freddie mac have increased credit spreads and decreased price stability of agency securities 
freddie mac and fannie mae have reported substantial losses and a need for substantial amounts of additional capital 
in response to the credit market disruption and the deteriorating financial condition of fannie mae and freddie mac  congress and the treasury and established a new regulator for fannie mae and freddie mac called the federal housing finance authority fhfa  with enhanced regulatory authority over  among other things  the business activities of fannie mae and freddie mac  including supervision over the size of their portfolio holdings 
the act also expanded the circumstances under which fannie mae and freddie mac could be placed into conservatorship and authorized fhfa to place fannie mae and freddie mac into receivership under certain circumstances 
on september   fhfa placed fannie mae and freddie mac into conservatorship 
in connection with the conservatorship  fhma announced  among other things  that i fannie mae and freddie mac would currently be permitted to continue to guarantee agency securities  ii fhfa had assumed the power of the board of directors and management of the entities  iii the chief executive officers of the entities had been replaced  iv the dividend on the outstanding common and preferred equity of fannie mae and freddie mac had been eliminated and v a financing and investing relationship between fannie mae and freddie mac had been established 
fhfa also noted that during the conservatorship  fhfa would work on additional regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac  some of which would include minimum capital standards and portfolio limits 
the newly established financing and investing relationship between fannie mae and freddie mac and the treasury includes the following components a program by which the treasury purchases fannie mae guaranteed and freddie mac guaranteed agency securities in the open market pursuant to an authority that expires december  the size and timing of the purchases are in the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and will be based on developments in the capital markets and housing markets 
the treasury may hold purchased agency securities to maturity and  based on market conditions  may make adjustments to the portfolio 
a secured credit facility to fannie mae and freddie mac 
funding under the credit facility will be provided directly by the treasury from its general fund held at the federal reserve bank of new york in exchange for eligible collateral from fannie mae and freddie mac 
loans under the credit facility are expected to be short term  generally between one week and one month in duration 
no loans will be made with a maturity date beyond december  preferred stock purchase agreements  which are arrangements for the treasury to make purchases of senior preferred equity in fannie mae and freddie mac designed to allow fannie mae and freddie mac to maintain a positive net worth and avoid mandatory triggering of their receivership 
initially  fannie mae and freddie mac have each issued billion of senior preferred stock to the treasury and warrants to purchase of the fully diluted common stock outstanding of such entity at a nominal price 
each preferred stock purchase agreement has a capacity of billion 
pursuant to the agreements  each of fannie mae s and freddie mac s mortgage and mbs portfolio will not exceed billion as of december   and will decline by each year until such portfolio reaches billion 
after reporting a substantial loss in the third quarter of  freddie mac requested a capital injection by the treasury of billion pursuant to its preferred stock purchase agreement 
while the treasury has stated that its actions are intended to provide stability to the financial markets and support availability of mortgage financing and now has committed significant resources to fannie mae and freddie mac  agency securities guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
moreover  the secretary of the treasury  in announcing the actions  noted that the guaranty structure of fannie mae and freddie mac required examination and that changes in the structures of the entities were necessary to reduce risk to the financial system 
such changes may involve an explicit us government backing of fannie mae and freddie mac agency securities or the express elimination of any implied us government guaranty and  therefore  the creation of credit risk with respect to fannie mae and freddie mac agency securities 
accordingly  the effect of the actions taken by the treasury and fhfa remains uncertain 
in addition  while specific steps within the conservatorships were announced  the scope and nature of the actions that the us treasury  fhfa or congress will ultimately undertake are unknown and will continue to evolve 
on november   the federal reserve announced that it will initiate a program to purchase billion in direct obligations of fannie mae  freddie mac and the federal home loan banks and billion in mortgage backed securities backed by fannie mae  freddie mac and the government national mortgage association ginnie mae 
the federal reserve stated that its actions are intended to reduce the cost and increase the availability of credit for the purchase of houses  which in turn should support housing markets and foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally 
the purchases of direct obligations began during the first week of december and the purchases of mortgage backed securities began in early january while the federal reserve s program to purchase mortgage backed securities could cause an increase in the price of agency securities  which would positively impact our book value  it could increase call and prepayment risk on callable agencies and mortgage backed securities and the cash flow would be subject to reinvestment risk 
call and prepayment risk are the cash flow risk resulting from the possibility that a bond is redeemed before maturity 
reinvestment risk is the result of the cash flow interest or the payment of principal of a security not being reinvested at a similarly attractive rate of return 
the resulting use of funds could have a negative impact on net interest margin 
in addition  us and foreign governments  central banks and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis including direct investment in debt and equity securities of financial institutions and other companies 
we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur or what impact  if any  such actions could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
overview the following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors affecting the company s financial condition as of december  and and results of operations for each of the years in the two year period ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands  except per share amounts 
income 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
other significant sources of pre tax income are service charges mostly from service charges on deposit accounts and loan servicing fees  fees from sale of mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market  and commissions on sales of securities and insurance products 
we also recognize income and loss from the sale of securities 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
expenses 
the non interest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses  occupancy expenses  federal deposit insurance premiums  data processing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 
our non interest expenses are likely to increase as a result of operating as a public company 
these additional expenses consist primarily of legal and accounting fees  expenses of shareholder communications and meetings  stock exchange listing fees  and expenses related to the addition of personnel in our accounting department 
salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes  and expenses for health insurance  retirement plans and other employee benefits 
we recognize additional annual employee compensation expenses related to the equity incentive plan which was approved by shareholders and adopted in occupancy expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment  consist primarily of depreciation charges  furniture and equipment expenses  maintenance  real estate taxes and costs of utilities 
depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight line method based on the useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to years 
data processing expenses are the fees we pay to third parties for processing customer information  deposits and loans 
federal deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the federal deposit insurance corporation for insurance of our deposit accounts 
other expenses include expenses for professional services  advertising  office supplies  postage  telephone  insurance  regulatory assessments and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the allowance for loan losses and the evaluation of other than temporary impairment to be our only critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are loss exposure at default  the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans  value of collateral  and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio 
all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change 
management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio  past loss experience  current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision  as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would adversely affect earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
other than temporary impairment 
management periodically evaluates the company s investment securities portfolio for other than temporary impairment 
if a security is considered to be other than temporarily impaired  the related unrealized loss is charged to earnings  and a new cost basis is established 
factors considered include the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to period end  and forecasted performance of the security issuer 
impairment is considered other than temporary unless the company has both the intent and ability to hold the security until the fair value recovers and evidence supporting the recovery outweighs evidence to the contrary 
however  for equity securities  which typically do not have a contractual maturity with a specified cash flow on which to rely  the ability to hold an equity security indefinitely  by itself  does not allow for avoidance of other than temporary impairment 
future changes in management s assessment of other than temporary impairment on its securities could result in significant charges to earnings in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
operating strategy under the leadership of our current senior management team  the majority of which was assembled in  our long term focus is to operate and grow a profitable community oriented financial institution 
we plan to achieve this objective by pursuing a strategy of improving our policies and procedures and internal control and information systems  utilizing what we believe are conservative underwriting practices to pursue construction lending opportunities in our primary market area  including speculative construction lending opportunities  and nonresidential real estate and commercial business lending opportunities with a focus on small businesses  continuing to emphasize consumer retail banking by offering a broad array of loan and deposit products  maintaining a stable core deposit base and providing remarkable customer service to attract and retain customers  and expanding our market share by opening new branch offices and pursuing opportunities to acquire other financial institutions  although we currently have no definitive plans regarding potential acquisition opportunities 
improving our policies and procedures and internal control and information systems we continue to improve our policies and procedures and will make further improvements to internal controls in order to maintain compliance with the provisions of sarbanes oxley 
in december of our board of directors adopted a new loan policy  effective january   which we believe will supply the proper structure for the bank s increased emphasis on small business  non residential real estate and commercial lending and also support the bank s future growth 
utilizing what we believe are conservative underwriting practices to continue to pursue in our primary market area construction lending  including speculative construction lending opportunities and nonresidential real estate and commercial business lending opportunities with a focus on small businesses we believe that high asset quality is a key to long term financial success 
under the leadership of our management team  we believe we have implemented conservative loan underwriting standards 
we intend to continue to pursue construction lending and nonresidential real estate and commercial business lending opportunities in our primary market area in accordance with those underwriting standards 
we believe the demographics of our primary market area  particularly a relatively young and growing population  provides such opportunities 
continuing to emphasize consumer retail banking by offering a broad array of loan and deposit products our mission is to offer a competitive line of loan and deposit products designed to meet the financial needs of consumers and small businesses in our primary market area 
toward this end  our goal is to attract and retain experienced lenders and customer support personnel and institute a strong customer service culture within our organization  which we believe will lead to increased sales

a net loss of million was recorded for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  results for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by other than temporary impairment otti charges for certain investment securities classified as available for sale and losses on the sale of federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac perpetual preferred securities 
during the third quarter of  we recognized million of other than temporary impairment on these investments 
in september  we recorded impairment charges of million for our investment grade perpetual callable preferred securities issued by freddie mac and fannie mae  and we recorded impairment charges of million for our investment in pooled trust preferred securities pretsls 
the net loss recorded for the year ended december  was primarily the result of losses realized on sales and write downs of available for sale securities of  and an additional  in total non interest expense 
these items were partially offset by a decrease of  in the provision for income taxes for net interest income 
net interest income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total interest income increased by million or  to million for the year ended december   as interest income on loans and securities increased and interest income on interest earning demand deposits and other interest bearing assets decreased 
interest income on loans increased by to million due to higher average balances while the average yield decreased by basis points 
interest income on investment securities increased by to million  primarily due to an increase in average investment securities balances 
total interest expense increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the two leverage transactions which added an average of million of long term borrowings at other banks to the balance sheet and resulted in an increase of  in interest expense 
average federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings increased by million and interest expense related to these borrowings increased  for the year ended december  these increases in interest expense were partially offset by a decrease of million  or basis points  in the cost of interest bearing deposits as average balances of interest bearing deposits also declined 
total interest bearing deposits decreased during the first half of due primarily to some customers utilizing funds on deposit with the bank to purchase stock in the initial public offering in late however  interest bearing deposits grew approximately million between june  and december  as management focused advertising and personnel on development of deposit relationships 
average balances and yields 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on assets and cost of liabilities for the periods indicated and the average yields earned and rates paid 
such yield and cost are derived by dividing income or expense by the average daily balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years ended december  and december  average balances were calculated using average monthly balances for full year average daily balances were not available for due to our systems conversion in the first quarter 
we believe the use of these average monthly balances for  rather than daily balances  are representative of our operations 
total average assets are computed using month end balances 
no tax equivalent adjustments have been made as the company s investment in tax exempt assets  during the periods presented  were immaterial 
the table also presents information for the periods indicated with respect to the differences between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  or interest rate spread  which banks have traditionally used as an indicator of profitability 
another indicator of net interest income is net interest margin  which is its net interest income divided by the average balance of interest earning assets

the following table shows the components of non interest income for the years ended december  and year ended december  change dollars in thousands non interest income customer service and other fees loan servicing and other fees net gains on loan sales net gain on sales of other real estate owned net realized loss on sales of available for sale securities other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities net realized gain on sales of other assets held for sale commissions on insurance and brokerage net gain loss on premises and equipment other total non interest income loss total non interest income for the year ended december   was a loss of million  a decrease of million compared to the year ended december  the overriding factor contributing to the loss in non interest income was other than temporary impairment otti charges and realized losses from the sale of perpetual preferred securities 
more specifically  in september  the company recorded otti charges of million for investment grade perpetual callable preferred securities issued by federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and federal national mortgage association fannie mae  and it recorded impairment charges of million for its investments in pooled trust preferred securities pretsls 
the company also recorded million in realized losses from the sale of fannie mae perpetual preferred stock during the third quarter of the company liquidated all of its remaining fannie mae and freddie mac perpetual preferred securities holdings during the fourth quarter of which resulted in additional realized losses of  these realized losses were partially offset by gains on the sale of available for sale securities of  which were realized during the fourth quarter of during the second quarter of  we realized a net loss of  on sales of available for sale securities  which was a result of selling lower yielding securities  with a carrying value of million  and purchased higher yielding securities in the amount of million to increase portfolio yield 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of we took a non cash otti charge of  for securities which was directly related to million of freddie mac and fannie mae preferred stock 
as mentioned in the preceding paragraph  the company liquidated all of its fannie mae and freddie mac perpetual preferred securities holdings during the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   loan servicing and other fees declined as the company s serviced loan portfolio continues to decline 
net gains on loan sales decreased primarily due to a decline in real estate sales in the bank s market area during in combination with tightening of credit underwriting criteria by the secondary markets 
the decrease in commissions on insurance and brokerage was primarily the result of overall market turmoil  which resulted in decreased brokerage activity in customer service and other fees increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in deposit holders at the bank 
the net realized gain on sales of other assets held for sale was primarily related to the march   sale of the bank s former headquarters 
non interest expense 
the following table shows the components of non interest expense and the percentage changes for the years ended december  and year ended december  change dollars in thousands non interest expense salaries and employee benefits net occupancy expense equipment expense data processing fees professional fees marketing expense office expense losses on foreclosed assets  net insurance expense mortgage loan outsourced servicing other total non interest expense non interest expense remained relatively unchanged for the year ended december  compared to the same period of the majority of increases in equipment expense  data processing fees  professional fees and salaries and employee benefits were offset by decreases in all other categories of non interest expense 
total salaries and employee benefits increased  or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   mainly due to a  or increase in base salaries and costs of  related to the company s executive incentive plan  which was partially offset by a  or  decrease in incentive compensation and an increased credit of  or  for deferred loan costs related to the growth in the loan portfolio 
the compensation committee of the board of directors determined that  due to the poor performance of the company for the year  the incentives paid to the executives of the company should be decreased accordingly 
the increase of  or  in equipment expense was primarily related to higher depreciation 
the increase of  or  in data processing fees was primarily due to higher fees incurred to expand our product offerings and services 
professional fees increased  or  in due to increased fees paid for accounting and consulting fees 
the increases in non interest expense were somewhat offset by declines in all other non interest expense categories for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  most notable was a decline of  or in mortgage loan outsourced servicing as the number of mortgage accounts we have outsourced for servicing continues to decline  with no additional loans being added 
net occupancy expense decreased  or primarily due to lower repair and maintenance costs and reduced real property tax expense related to the sale of our former headquarters building 
provision credit for income taxes 
the credit for income taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to a credit of  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the net loss for both years 
the effective tax rate for was compared to for the increase in effective tax rate reflects the impact of our net loss for the year combined with a decrease in the relative impact of tax exempt income on the overall tax rate 
risk management overview 
managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution 
our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk  interest rate risk and market risk 
credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments  such as available for sale securities  that are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
other risks that we face are operational risks  liquidity risks and reputation risk 
operational risks include risks related to fraud  regulatory compliance  processing errors  technology and disaster recovery 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  lenders or borrowers 
reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press  whether true or not  could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue 
credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans 
when a borrower fails to make a required loan payment  we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status 
when the loan becomes days past due  a late notice is sent to the borrower 
when the loan becomes days past due  a more formal letter is sent 
between and days past due  telephone calls are also made to the borrower 
after days  we regard the borrower as in default 
at days delinquent  the borrower may be sent a letter from our attorney and we may commence collection proceedings 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full  or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan is sold at foreclosure 
when a consumer loan becomes days past due  we institute collection proceedings and attempt to repossess any personal property that secures the loan 
management informs the board of directors monthly of the amount of loans delinquent more than days  all loans in foreclosure and repossessed property that we own 
analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
we consider repossessed assets and loans that are days or more past due to be nonperforming assets 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become days delinquent at which time the accrual of interest ceases and the allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations 
typically  payments received on a nonaccrual loan are first applied to the outstanding principal balance 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold 
when property is acquired it is recorded at fair market value at the date of foreclosure 
holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income 
interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income 
subsequent interest payments are applied to the outstanding principal balance 
the following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
we had no troubled debt restructurings at any of the dates indicated and we had no impaired loans at december  at december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans one to four family multifamily and nonresidential construction land consumer commercial total accruing loans past due days or more one to four family multi family and nonresidential construction land consumer commercial total total of nonaccrual and days or more past due loans real estate owned other nonperforming assets total nonperforming assets total nonperforming loans to total loans total nonperforming loans to total assets total nonperforming assets to total assets the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans declined from to primarily due to the growth in the loan portfolio  while total nonperforming loans were relatively unchanged 
federal regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision has the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
the regulations also provide for a special mention category  described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention 
when we classify an asset as substandard or doubtful we may establish a specific allowance for loan losses 
if we classify an asset as loss  we charge off an amount equal to of the portion of the asset classified loss 
the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified assets at the dates indicated 
at december  dollars in thousands special mention assets substandard assets doubtful assets loss assets total classified assets classified assets includes loans that are classified due to factors other than payment delinquencies  such as lack of current financial statements and other required documentation  insufficient cash flows or other deficiencies  and  therefore  are not included as non performing assets 
other than as disclosed in the above tables  there are no other loans where management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
analysis and determination of the allowance for loan losses 
in december  the bank s board of directors approved a new loan policy for the bank  effective on january   which incorporates the policy on allowance for loan losses 
the new policy is consistent with the prior policy as it relates to the allowance for loan losses 
a description of the procedures for determining the allowance for loan losses is discussed in detail below 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio and represents management s best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based upon management s evaluation of the portfolio s collectibility 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
the recommendations for increases or decreases to the allowance are presented by management to the board of directors 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of a specific allowance on identified problem loans  and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
management estimates a range of losses and then makes its best estimate of potential credit losses within that range 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
specific allowance required for identified problem loans 
we establish an allowance on certain identified problem loans based on such factors as the strength of the customer s personal or business cash flows  the availability of other sources of repayment  the amount due or past due  the type and value of collateral  the strength of our collateral position  the estimated cost and timing to sell the collateral  and the borrower s effort to cure the delinquency 
general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
we establish a general allowance for loans that are not currently classified in order to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities 
this general valuation allowance is determined through two steps 
first  we estimate potential losses on the portfolio by analyzing historical losses for each loan category 
second  we look at additional significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures  international  national  regional and local economic conditions  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management  changes in the volume of past dues  non accruals and classified assets  changes in the quality of the loan review system  changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  concentrations of credit  and other factors 
we also identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans  classified loans and other loans for which management may have concerns about collectibility 
for individually reviewed loans  the borrower s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan or a shortfall in collateral value would result in our allocating a portion of the allowance to the loan that was impaired 
at december   our allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans and of nonperforming loans 
at december   our allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans and of nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased  to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to the volume of loan growth we experienced during the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated

furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that the office of thrift supervision  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not require us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
the office of thrift supervision may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the bank relies on deposits as its principal source of funds and  therefore  must be in a position to service depositors needs as they arise 
fluctuations in the balances of a few large depositors may cause temporary increases and decreases in liquidity from time to time 
we deal with such fluctuations by using existing liquidity sources 
concerns over deposit fluctuations with respect to the overall banking industry were addressed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic in september and october the fdic temporarily increased the individual account deposit insurance from  per account to  per account through december  the fdic also implemented the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  which provides for full fdic coverage for transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amounts 
the bank elected to opt in to this program  thus  our customers will receive full coverage for transaction accounts under the program 
the fdic also implemented a debt guarantee program where it guarantees all newly issued senior unsecured debt up to prescribed limits by a participating bank on or after october  through and including june  the company and the bank elected to opt in to this program  which would provide unsecured senior debt to the company and the bank in the form of greater than day term notes 
as of december   no guaranteed senior unsecured debt had been issued by the company or the bank 
on february   the fdic extended the debt guarantee program for an additional four months until october additionally  the company has become a member of the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars program 
through cdars  the bank s customers can increase their fdic insurance by up to million through reciprocal certificate of deposit accounts 
this is accomplished by the bank entering into reciprocal depository relationships with other member banks 
pursuant to this arrangement  an individual customer s large deposit is broken into amounts below the  amount or  if the time deposit matures prior to december  and placed with other banks that are members of the network 
the reciprocal member banks then issue certificates of deposit in amounts that ensure that the entire deposit is eligible for fdic insurance 
liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
additionally  as described above  the company joined the cdars program and can purchase certificates of deposit through this program 
at december   the company was not actively participating in the cdars program  however  the company is eligible to purchase certificates of deposit of up to five percent of its total assets through cdars 
these sources provide significant secondary liquidity to the company to service its depositors needs 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability management policy 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits 
the levels of these assets depend on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
securities classified as available for sale  amounting to million at december   provide additional sources of liquidity 
in addition  at december   we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately million from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati 
at december   we had million in federal home loan bank advances outstanding 
off balance sheet arrangements  commitments and contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with accepted accounting principles are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit  see note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
for the year ended december   we did not engage in any off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
commitments 
at december   we had million in loan commitments outstanding  million in unused commercial lines of credit including unadvanced portions of construction loans and million in unused open end consumer lines of credit 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of certificates of deposit 
we believe the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods due to the recent low interest rate environment and local competitive pressure 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered

we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the office of thrift supervision  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december  and  we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements 
we are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines

effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this annual report have been prepared according to accepted accounting principles in the united states  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management the bank manages the interest rate sensitivity of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of earnings  the bank has sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
the bank s strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes adjusting the maturities of borrowings  adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration and selling in the secondary market substantially all newly originated one to four family residential real estate loans 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments 
the bank has an asset liability committee  which includes members of management approved by the board of directors  to communicate  coordinate and control all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committee establishes and monitors the volume  maturities  pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
the goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income 
net portfolio value analysis the bank uses a net portfolio value analysis prepared by the office of thrift supervision to review the level of the bank s interest rate risk 
this analysis measures interest rate risk by capturing changes in the net portfolio value of the bank s cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items  based on a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
these analyses assess risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or and basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that the bank might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
the following table  which is based on information that the bank provided to the office of thrift supervision  presents the change in the bank s net portfolio value at december  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on office of thrift supervision assumptions  with no effect given to any steps the bank might take to counteract that change

these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan repayment rates  deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analyses presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis over the life of the asset 
further  if there is a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities held by the bank  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of the bank s earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
the bank s asset sensitivity would be reduced if repayments slow and vice versa 
while we believe these assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity
