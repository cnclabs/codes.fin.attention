amounts in thousands unless otherwise indicated 
overview the business of bioanalytical systems  inc is largely dependent on the level of pharmaceutical and biotech companies efforts in new drug discovery and approval 
our services segment is the direct beneficiary of these efforts  through outsourcing by these companies of research work 
our products segment is the indirect beneficiary  as increased drug development leads to capital expansion providing opportunities to sell the equipment we produce and the consumable supplies we provide that support our products 
developments within the industries we serve have a direct  and sometimes material  impact on our operations 
currently  many large pharmaceutical companies have major block buster drugs that are nearing the end of their patent protections 
this puts significant pressure on these companies both to develop new drugs with large market appeal  and to re evaluate their cost structures and the time to market of their products 
contract research organizations cro s have benefited from these developments  as the pharmaceutical industry has turned to out sourcing to both reduce fixed costs  and to increase the speed of research and data development necessary for new drug applications 
the number of significant drugs that have reached or are nearing the end of their patent protection has also benefited the generic drug industry 
that sector of the drug industry has seen significant growth in the past decade  and  we believe  will continue to experience strong growth in the foreseeable future 
generic drug companies provide a significant source of new business for cro s as they develop  test and manufacture their generic compounds 
a significant portion of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is now being driven by biotech and small  venture capital funded  drug development companies 
many of these companies are single molecule entities  whose success depends on one innovative compound 
while several of the biotech companies have reached the status of major pharmaceuticals  the industry is still characterized by smaller entities 
these developmental companies generally do not have the resources to perform much of the research within their organizations  and are therefore dependent on the cro industry for both their research and for guidance in preparing their fda submissions 
these companies have provided significant new opportunities for the cro industry  including us 
they do  however  provide challenges in selling  as they frequently have only one product in development  which causes cro s to be unable to develop a flow of projects from a single company 
these companies may expend all their available funds and cease operations prior to fully developing a product 
additionally  the funding of these companies is subject to investment market fluctuations  which changes with changes to the risk profile and appetite of investors 
since the end of the fiscal year on september   we have observed a trend whereby many drug development companies have reduced their spending on cro services 
we believe that this change was in connection with the global economic and credit market situations 
the outcome of these factors and their impact on our future performance are not known at this time 
although the past year has not seen large mergers in either the pharmaceutical or cro industries  consolidation continues at a smaller pace in the cro sector 
we believe that consolidation of the cro sector will continue to be a factor in our markets 
as consolidation continues in the cro sector  competition among remaining companies continues to be more intense 
research services are capital intensive 
the investment in equipment and facilities to serve our markets is substantial and continuing 
while our physical facilities are excellent to meet market needs for the near term  rapid changes in automation  precision  speed and technologies necessitate a constant investment in equipment and software to meet market demands 
we are also impacted by the heightened regulatory environment and the need to improve our business infrastructure to support our increasingly diverse operations  which will necessitate additional capital investment 
our ability to generate capital to reinvest in our capabilities  both through operations and financial transactions  is critical to our success 
while we are currently committed to fully utilizing recent additions to capacity  sustained growth will require additional investment in future periods 
our financial position could limit our ability to make such investments 
results of operations the following table summarizes the condensed consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of total revenues of continuing operations year ended september  service revenue product revenue total revenue cost of service revenue a cost of product revenue a total cost of revenue gross profit total operating expenses operating income other expense income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net income from continuing operations a percentage of service and product revenues  respectively 
compared to service and product revenues revenues for the year ended september  increased to  compared to  for the year ended september  our service revenue increased to  compared to  for the prior year primarily as a result of strong increases in bioanalytical and pharmaceutical analysis revenues 
our bioanalytical analysis revenues increased  a increase over fiscal  with improvements at the west lafayette and the uk facilities 
the revenue increases from the uk facility are mainly due to increased volume when compared to the prior year 
the west lafayette facility experienced a higher sample assay volume and an increase in immunochemistry revenues of nearly over the prior year 
pharmaceutical analysis revenues increased  or over fiscal  as enhanced sales efforts have aided in business growth for this group 
toxicology revenues also contributed to the year over year increase with a  or  increase 
study delays and cancellations contributed to the lower growth rate for the toxicology group 
sales in our products segment decreased from  to  when compared to the same period in the prior year 
the majority of that decrease stems from our vetronics business of primarily because a contract with a long time client was not renewed in fiscal sales of our culex automated in vivo sampling systems declined to  from  mainly due to the sales of fewer units 
finally  the sales of our more mature analytical products also declined  or  from fiscal costs of revenues cost of revenues for the year ended september  was  or of revenue compared to  or of revenue for the comparable prior period 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased to in the current fiscal year from in the comparable period last year 
this decrease occurred because a significant portion of our costs of productive capacity in the service segment are fixed 
thus  increases in revenue do not generate proportionate increases in costs 
this decrease occurred even though an additional charge of was incurred in the third quarter of the current fiscal year to cover the net costs of performing a study for a client to recreate data that was not properly archived 
costs of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue in the current fiscal year decreased from to 
the decrease in the percentage was mainly due to a decrease in our periodic charges for inventory obsolescence of this was the result of higher charges last fiscal year for products that were discontinued 
operating expenses selling expenses for the year ended september  increased by to  from  for the year ended september  this increase was primarily driven by expanded sales efforts and new hires in both our west lafayette and uk facilities along with increased marketing and advertising efforts 
also  accelerated amortization of  related to the impairment of assets in fiscal  added to the increase 
the impairment of certain patents  licenses and trademarks reflected a management decision to no longer support these assets as active since they have no related revenue generating products 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  decreased to from for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily a result of costs related to the commercialization of our pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics services being considered as cost of services  whereas in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year  they were considered research and development expenses 
these were partially offset by higher spending for operating supplies and outside consultants used in our continued effort on the development of a new product funded by an nih grant 
general and administrative expenses for the current year increased to  from  for the prior year 
the increase is mainly due to the following expenses for attracting and hiring new management personnel in our west lafayette and uk facilities  an increase in stock compensation expense with the new option grants in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  currency losses  an increase in building rent expense for our new uk facility  increased travel related expenses  and expenses related to sox compliance 
other income expense other income expense  net  was for the year ended september  as compared to in the year ended september  this increase is due to borrowings on our line of credit  causing higher interest expense and lower interest income year over year 
in fiscal  we did not borrow on our line of credit 
income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended september  was compared to for the prior year period 
the main difference stems from taxes on slightly higher domestic income in fiscal from which we could not deduct the current loss from our uk facility as well as the additional expense for uncertain tax positions 
in fiscal  our uk facility was profitable 
we computed our income taxes using an effective tax rate of on domestic earnings for the year ended september  we did not provide income taxes on foreign earnings due to the availability of net operating loss carryforwards to offset our taxable income  which have not previously been recognized for financial statement purposes due to the uncertainty of future utilization 
discontinued operations on june   we sold the operating assets of our baltimore clinical pharmacology research unit cpru to algorithme pharma usa inc ap usa and algorithme pharma holdings inc 
algorithme for a cash payment of  and they assumed certain liabilities related to the cpru 
as a result  we have exited the market for phase i first in human clinical studies 
should ap usa and algorithme fail to meet their lease commitments  we remain contingently liable for annually through for future financial obligations under the cpru facility lease 
for further detail  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and exhibits and to the current report on form k filed on july  accordingly  in the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  we have segregated the results of the cpru as discontinued operations for the current and prior fiscal years 
the loss from discontinued operations reflects the results of operations of the cpru through the sale date adjusted for changes in estimates used to calculate the loss on disposal 
the remaining estimated cash expenditures related to this unit are recorded as current liabilities of discontinued operations  since they are expected to be paid within fiscal year these expenditures relate mostly to normal operating expenses 
the current assets of discontinued operations relate mostly to outstanding customer receivables for completed clinical trials 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adjusted estimates from the sale date that were included in the loss on disposal for actual expenses incurred 
this resulted in a increase to the loss on disposal 
liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis since inception  our principal sources of cash have been cash flow generated from operations and funds received from bank borrowings and other financings 
at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of compared to  at september  net cash provided by continuing operating activities was  for the year ended september   compared to  for the year ended september  in addition to earnings from continuing operations  an increase in accounts payable of and an increase in deferred income taxes liability added non cash charges to operations of  for depreciation and amortization and for employee stock option expense increased our expenses  but did not consume cash 
these were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  while our receivables vary depending on where we stand in our mix of contracts  we believe that our new procedures instituted in the prior fiscal year in billings and collections contributed to the current positive cash flow from continuing operations 
investing activities used  in fiscal mainly due to capital expenditures 
our principal investments were for laboratory equipment replacements and upgrades in our west lafayette  oregon and uk facilities  new building improvements in the uk related to relocating to new space  construction costs in our evansville facility to convert an area for higher revenue studies and general building and information technology infrastructure expenditures at all sites 
financing activities used  in the current fiscal year as compared to  used for fiscal the main use of cash in fiscal was to repay the balance of our subordinated debt  approximately  as well as other long term debt and capital lease payments of  partially offset by  of new long term debt and  net borrowings from our line of credit 
in fiscal  we did not borrow from the line of credit and repaid  in long term debt and capital leases 
since the acquisition of the baltimore clinic in fiscal  we had consistently experienced negative cash flows from that operation 
with the sale of that operation on june   we eliminated a significant drain on operating cash flows  which should result in improved future liquidity 
during the year ended september   cash used in operating activities for discontinued operations of  is mainly from the loss on operations 
the provided by investing activities for discontinued operations during the current fiscal year is mainly due to the of cash proceeds from the sale partially offset by capital expenditures 
capital resources property and equipment spending totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal is the result of the tenant improvements on our new lease in the uk facility as well as laboratory equipment financed mainly through capital leases in the west lafayette and evansville  indiana facilities 
expenditures in fiscal were primarily for the purchase of laboratory equipment 
capital investments for the purchase of additional laboratory equipment are driven by anticipated increases in research services  and by the replacement or upgrading of our equipment 
although we may consider strategic acquisition opportunities  we do not intend to aggressively pursue additional acquisitions until we fully utilize existing capacity 
we amended our revolving line of credit the agreement in october  reducing our line of credit to million from million as we did not have qualifying assets sufficient to borrow the higher amount and were paying fees on amounts we could not use 
we also have three mortgage notes payable to another bank aggregating million 
borrowings under these credit agreements are collateralized by substantially all assets related to our operations and all common stock of our us subsidiaries and of the common stock of our non united states subsidiaries 
under the terms of these credit agreements  we have agreed to restrict advances to subsidiaries  limit additional indebtedness and capital expenditures as well as comply with certain financial covenants outlined below 
these credit agreements contain cross default provisions with our mortgages or other borrowings 
details of each debt issue are discussed below 
our agreement limits outstanding borrowings to the borrowing base  as defined in the agreement  up to a maximum available amount of  as of september   we had  of available total borrowing capacity of which  is outstanding 
borrowings bear interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offer rate libor or a base rate determined by the lender s prime rate plus an applicable margin  as defined in the agreement 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the line of credit ranges from to for base rate borrowings and to for libor borrowings  subject to adjustment based on the average availability under the line of credit 
we also pay commitment fees on the unused portions of the line of credit ranging from 
all interest and fees are paid monthly 
the line of credit is a revolver against which we apply cash receipts  and draw cash as needed 
the line of credit is committed until december  on december   we entered into a new mortgage with regions bank regions under which regions loaned us  under a term loan maturing december  interest on the loan is equal to libor plus basis points and requires monthly payments of approximately plus interest  currently at 
the outstanding balance on this loan at september  was  the loan is collateralized by real estate at the company s west lafayette and evansville  indiana locations 
regions holds additional mortgage debt on these facilities as discussed below 
we used a portion of the proceeds of the loan and existing cash on hand to repay our subordinated debt of approximately  during the first fiscal quarter 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with respect to this loan to fix the interest rate at 
we only entered into this derivative transaction to hedge interest rate risk of this debt obligation and not to speculate on interest rates 
the fair value of the swap is not material to the financial statements 
we have three outstanding mortgages with regions on our facilities in west lafayette and evansville  indiana  which total  two of the mortgages mature in november with an interest rate fixed at  while the other matures in february of due to a renewal completed in february of for an additional three years at an interest rate of 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the covenants in our revolving line of credit require that we maintain certain ratios of interest bearing indebtedness to ebitda and net cash flow to debt servicing requirements  which may restrict the amount we can borrow to fund future operations  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
additionally  the covenants in our loan agreements with regions require us to maintain certain ratios including a fixed charge coverage ratio and total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio 
the agreement and the regions loans both contain cross default provisions 
at september   we were in breach of our tangible net worth requirement  which was subsequently waived and the requirement amended as of december  the following table summarizes the cash payments under our contractual term debt and lease obligations at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future fiscal periods amounts in thousands 
the table does not include our revolving line of credit 
additional information on the debt is described in note  debt arrangements 
after total mortgage notes payable capital lease obligations operating leases fin liability a million letter of credit securing the baltimore  md lease expired in january and was not renewed 
we anticipate spending approximately million in fiscal on capital assets  primarily laboratory equipment which will be financed using capital leases 
based on current business activities  we believe cash generated from operations and amounts available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future and through september  inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and are considered critical accounting policies 
we have identified the following areas as critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the majority of our service contracts involve the processing of bioanalytical samples for pharmaceutical companies 
these contracts generally provide for a fixed fee for each assay method developed or sample processed and revenue is recognized under the specific performance method of accounting 
under the specific performance method  revenue and related direct costs are recognized when services are performed 
other service contracts generally consist of preclinical studies for pharmaceutical companies 
service revenue is recognized based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs under the proportional performance method of accounting 
losses on contracts are provided in the period in which the loss becomes determinable 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected on a cumulative basis in the period in which such revisions become known 
the establishment of contract prices and total contract costs involves estimates made by the company at the inception of the contract period 
these estimates could change during the term of the contract which could impact the revenue and costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
projected losses on contracts are provided for in their entirety when known 
revisions to estimates have not been material 
service contract fees received upon acceptance are deferred and classified within customer advances  until earned 
unbilled revenues represent revenues earned under contracts in advance of billings 
product revenue from sales of equipment not requiring installation  testing or training is recognized upon shipment to customers 
one product includes internally developed software and requires installation  testing and training  which occur concurrently 
revenue from these sales is recognized upon completion of the installation  testing and training when the services are bundled with the equipment sale 
long lived assets  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
during  we recorded an impairment charge for related to certain patents  licenses and trademarks that have no revenue generating products 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  collectively referred to as indefinite lived assets  are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
at september   recorded goodwill was  and the net balance of other intangible assets was stock based compensation we recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions in our financial statements using a fair value based method 
we measure compensation cost for all share based awards based on estimated fair values and recognize compensation over the vesting period for awards 
we recognized stock based compensation related to stock options of and during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
we use the binomial option valuation model to determine the grant date fair value 
the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award 
generally  our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes 
we estimated the following key assumptions for the binomial valuation calculation risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected volatility 
we use our historical stock price volatility on our common stock for our expected volatility assumption 
expected term 
the expected term represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is determined based on historical exercise behavior  post vesting termination patterns  options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior 
expected dividends 
we assumed that we will pay no dividends 
employee stock based compensation expense recognized in fiscal and was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment will be recognized at that time 
changes to our underlying stock price  our assumptions used in the binomial option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate as well as future grants of equity could significantly impact compensation expense recognized in fiscal as well as future periods 
income tax accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
additionally  in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which we adopted effective october   when warranted  we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions 
under fin  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that we believe is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position 
on october   we recorded a additional liability for uncertain income tax positions for a total liability of  which was accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings  for the cumulative effect change of adopting fin upon further analysis of our opening liability accounts  we determined that our recorded liability on october  was greater than our fin liability for uncertain tax positions 
accordingly  we revised our original adjustment and recorded a reduction in tax liability and increase in retained earnings to properly record our estimate of fin exposure 
during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded for additional exposure on uncertain tax positions and as a reduction of uncertain tax positions  thus increasing our reserve for uncertain income tax positions at september  to this reserve is classified as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheet based on when we expect each of the items to be settled 
we record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain income tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
see note for additional information 
any changes in the liability for uncertain tax positions would impact our effective tax rate 
over the next twelve months  it is reasonably possible that the uncertainty surrounding our reserve for uncertain income tax positions  which relate to certain state income tax issues  will be resolved upon the conclusion of state tax audits 
accordingly  if such resolutions are favorable  we would reduce the carrying value of our reserve 
we have an accumulated net deficit in our uk subsidiaries  consequently  united states deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo cost method of accounting 
new accounting pronouncements we adopted the following pronouncement for periods beginning october  effective october   we adopted the provisions of fin this authoritative interpretation clarified and standardized the manner by which companies are required to account for uncertain income tax positions 
under the guidance of fin  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon regulatory examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the amount of the benefit for which an exposure exists is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that we believe is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position 
in order to adjust our estimated liability of at october   we recorded a reduction in tax liability for uncertain income tax positions  which was accounted for as an increase to retained earnings  for the cumulative effect change of adopting fin the adoption amount was adjusted from our first quarter filing as explained in our critical accounting policies for income tax accounting above
