item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition  changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas exploration  development  acquisition  and production company 
our basic business model is to increase shareholder value by finding and developing oil and gas reserves through exploration and development activities  and selling the production from those reserves at a profit 
to be successful  we must  over time  be able to find oil and gas reserves and then sell the resulting production at a price that is sufficient to cover our finding costs  operating expenses  administrative costs and interest expense  plus offer us a return on our capital investment 
from time to time  we may also acquire producing properties if we believe the acquired assets offer us the potential for reserve growth through additional developmental or exploratory drilling activities 
for most of  the economic climate in the domestic oil and gas industry was suitable for our business model 
until recently  oil and gas prices were favorable and provided us with the economic incentives necessary to assume the risks we face in our search for oil and gas reserves despite higher drilling  completion and operating expenses 
during the second half of  global economies began to experience a significant slowdown sparked by a near collapse in worldwide financial markets 
this slowdown has continued to intensify into the first quarter of and is currently being viewed by many economists as the most severe recession in united states history  second only to the great depression 
the united states government has taken significant steps to support the financial markets and stimulate the economy in an effort to slow or reverse the downward spiral of economic indicators  but the success of these measures and the duration of the current recession cannot be predicted 
reduced demand for energy caused by the current recession has resulted in a significant deterioration in oil and gas prices  which in turn has led to a significant reduction in drilling activity throughout the oil and gas industry 
while the prices we pay for field services are beginning to decline as a result of reduced demand for those services  the decline in these prices is generally lagging behind the declines in oil and gas prices 
as a result  we experienced reductions in operating margins during the last half of and reported negative price revisions to our proved reserves due to lower product prices and still relatively high capital and operating costs 
the effects of lower operating margins on our business are significant since they reduce our cash flow from operations and diminish the present value of our oil and gas reserves 
these factors have an adverse affect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base 
lower operating margins also offer us less incentive to assume the drilling risks that are inherent in our business 
in response to decreases in product prices and the resulting effect on our operating margins  we currently plan to reduce capital spending during fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal we are monitoring the impact of the recession on our business  including the extent to which lower commodity prices could affect our financial liquidity 
while we believe we are taking appropriate actions to preserve our short term liquidity  a prolonged recession of this magnitude could negatively impact our long term liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
key factors to consider the following summarizes the key factors considered by management in the review of our financial condition and operating performance for and the outlook for our oil and gas sales increased million  or  from  comprised of million in price variances and million in volume variances 
during  we decreased borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million from million at december  to million at december  by utilizing cash proceeds from the sales of assets and the early termination of derivative contracts 
we spent million on exploration and development activities during fiscal  of which approximately was on exploratory prospects 
we currently plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development for fiscal  with approximately applied to exploratory activities 
exploration costs were million for  of which approximately million related to unsuccessful exploratory well costs  million related to impairment of unproved acreage and the remaining million was spent on seismic related activities 
most of the abandonment and impairment costs in related to prospects in the east texas bossier area and north louisiana 
we recorded a non cash charge during of million for impairments pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas including proved oil and gas property impairments of million for the margarita well to reduce the carrying value to its estimated fair value 
at december   our capitalized unproved oil and gas properties totaled million  of which approximately million was attributable to unproved acreage 
unproved properties are subject to a valuation impairment to the extent the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated fair value 
therefore  our results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected by unproved property impairments 
we recorded a million net gain on derivatives in fiscal  consisting of a million realized gain on settled contracts and a million gain for changes in mark to market valuations 
in december  the company terminated substantially all of its then existing derivative contracts for cash proceeds of million 
the terminated contracts covered million barrels of oil production and million mmbtu of gas production for and since we do not presently designate our derivatives as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards  we recognize the full effect of changing prices on mark to market valuations as a current charge or credit to our results of operations 
our estimated proved oil and gas reserves at december  were bcfe compared to bcfe at december  we added bcfe through extensions and discoveries  had downward net revisions of bcfe and had sales of minerals in place of bcfe 
proved oil and gas reserves the following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved reserves during on a bcfe basis 
bcfe total proved reserves  december  extensions and discoveries sales of minerals in place revisions production total proved reserves  december  during  we replaced of the bcfe that we produced in through extensions and discoveries 
following is a discussion of the important factors related to each source of net reserve changes during extensions and discoveries 
our extensions and discoveries during consist of estimated proved reserves attributable directly to the drilling of discovery wells primarily in north louisiana  south louisiana and the permian basin 
of the bcfe of additions  substantially all are proved developed reserves 
due to the nature of exploratory drilling  we cannot predict the extent to which we will add any reserves in through extensions and discoveries 
sales of minerals in place 
we sold all our interest in sixteen producing wells located in south louisiana consisting of bcfe during the second quarter of revisions 
our estimated proved reserves were bcfe lower due to revisions of previous estimates 
downward revisions of bcfe were attributable to the effects of lower product prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves 
net upward revisions of approximately bcfe were attributable to well performance and consisted primarily of net upward adjustments in the permian basin  austin chalk trend and cotton valley reef complex  offset in part by downward adjustments in north and south louisiana

operating results compared to the following discussion compares our results for the year ended december  to the year ended december  unless otherwise indicated  references to and within this section refer to the respective annual periods 
oil and gas operating results oil and gas sales in increased million  or  from price variances accounted for million of this increase and production volume variances accounted for the remaining million of incremental sales 
production in on an mcfe basis was higher than oil production increased and gas production decreased in from the comparability of production between and was affected by two primary factors 
certain south louisiana properties were sold during the second quarter of and south louisiana production in was curtailed due to hurricanes gustav and ike 
in  our realized oil price was higher than  while our realized gas price was higher 
product prices during the first quarter of have continued to decline as a result of a global economic recession 
we cannot predict the extent or duration of the current product price environment 
production costs  consisting of lease operating expenses  production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs  increased in as compared to some of the key components giving rise to the higher costs included increases in oilfield service costs  higher repair and maintenance costs and increased production tax costs related to higher product prices 
after giving effect to a increase in oil and gas production on an mcfe basis  production costs per mcfe increased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in we expect lower demand for field services to result in a reduction in production costs  but the timing and extent of any reductions cannot be predicted 
oil and gas depletion expense increased million from to  of which rate variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a million increase 
on an mcfe basis  depletion expense increased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in due to a combination of higher depletable costs and lower estimated reserve quantities in compared to the period 
depletion expense per mcfe of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production 
we recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment under sfas of million during  including million related to the margarita well in our east texas bossier area 
we recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment under sfas of million during  of which million related to write downs of two  horsepower drilling rigs and related components  million related to well service equipment  and million related to producing properties in the permian basin 
exploration costs since we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved acreage impairments are expensed 
in  we charged to expense million of exploration costs  as compared to million in at december   our capitalized unproved oil and gas properties totaled million  of which approximately million was attributable to unproved acreage 
unproved properties are subject to a valuation impairment to the extent the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated fair value 
therefore  our results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected by unproved property impairments 
we plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development activities in  of which approximately is expected to be allocated to exploration activities 
since exploratory drilling involves a high degree of risk  it is likely that a significant portion of the costs we incur in will be charged to exploration costs 
however  we cannot predict our success rates and  accordingly  cannot predict our exploration costs related to abandonment and impairment costs 
contract drilling services in april  we formed larclay jv  a joint venture with lariat to construct  own  and operate new drilling rigs 
we own a equity interest in larclay jv 
although the company and lariat own equal interests in larclay jv  we meet the definition of the primary beneficiary of larclay jv s expected cash flows under fin r 
as the primary beneficiary under fin r  we are required to include the accounts of larclay jv in our consolidated financial statements 
during  we included contract drilling revenues of million  other operating expenses of million  depreciation expense of million and interest expense of million in our statement of operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
since the larclay jv drilling rigs are partially utilized by us  the reported amounts are net of any intercompany profits eliminated in consolidation 
general and administrative general and administrative g a expenses increased from million in to million in excluding non cash employee compensation  g a expenses increased from million in to million in due in part to cash bonuses paid to employees in connection with our sale of properties in south louisiana and higher personnel costs 
in  we recorded a million non cash compensation charge related to our after payout incentive plan and  for stock based compensation to directors 
in  we recorded a million non cash compensation charge related to our after payout incentive plan and  for stock based compensation to directors 
interest expense interest expense decreased from million in to million in due to a combination of reduced debt levels and lower interest rates 
the average daily principal balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility for was million compared to million for during  we received approximately million from the sale of property and equipment and used the net proceeds to reduce indebtedness outstanding under on our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we received approximately million of cash proceeds from the early termination of derivative contracts 
debt reductions on our revolving credit facility accounted for million of the decrease in interest expense  while lower interest rates resulted in a decrease of approximately million 
in addition  capitalized interest for was million compared to million in  and interest expense associated with our larclay jv during was million compared to million in gain loss on derivatives we did not designate any derivative contracts in or as cash flow hedges  therefore all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark to market valuations have been recorded as gain loss on derivatives 
for  we reported a million net gain on derivatives  consisting of a million non cash gain to mark our derivative positions to their fair value and a million realized gain on settled contracts 
for  we reported a million net loss on derivatives  consisting of an million non cash loss to mark our derivative positions to their fair value at december  and a million realized loss on settled contracts 
because oil and gas prices are volatile  and because we do not account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges  the effect of mark to market valuations on our gain loss on derivatives can cause significant volatility in our results of operations 
gain loss on sales of property and equipment we recorded a net gain on sales of property and equipment of million for  which included a million gain on sales of properties in south louisiana  a million gain on the sale of a north louisiana prospect  and a million gain on the sales of two drilling rigs and a surplus well servicing unit 
in  we recorded a net gain of million  which included the sale of all of our producing and non producing acreage in pecos county  texas for million  net of closing costs  and recorded a gain of approximately million in connection with this sale  offset by a million loss due primarily to the write down of inventory to its market value 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate in of differed from the statutory federal rate of due primarily to increases in the tax provision related primarily to the effects of the texas margin tax and certain non deductible expenses  offset in part by tax benefits derived from statutory depletion deductions 
compared to the following discussion compares our results for the year ended december  to the year ended december  unless otherwise indicated  references to and within this section refer to the respective annual periods 
oil and gas operating results oil and gas sales in increased million  or  from  of which production variances accounted for a million increase and price variances accounted for a million increase 
production in on an mcfe basis was higher than oil production increased and gas production increased in as compared to due primarily to production attributable to recent drilling activities in north and south louisiana 
in  our realized oil price was higher than  while our realized gas price was higher 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
production costs  consisting of lease operating expenses  production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs  increased in as compared to due to a combination of factors including increased oil and gas production  rising oilfield service costs  and higher repair and maintenance costs 
after giving effect to a increase in oil and gas production on an mcfe basis  production costs per mcfe decreased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in it is likely that these factors will continue to contribute to higher production costs in future periods 
dd a expense increased from million in to million in dd a expense attributable to oil and gas properties increased million  primarily due to production increases 
on an mcfe basis  oil and gas depletion expense remained constant at per mcfe in and dd a per mcfe of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production 
we recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment under sfas of million during  of which million related to write downs of two  horsepower drilling rigs and related components and million charge for well service equipment to reduce the carrying value to their estimated fair market value 
the remaining million impairment related to producing properties in the permian basin 
we recorded a provision for impairment of proved properties of million in we have capitalized million of drilling and completion costs associated with two wells in our east texas bossier area that were in progress at december  and were completed as marginal producers during the first quarter of we have not assigned any proved reserves to these wells since we do not have sufficient production history to permit us to make a reasonable estimate at this time 
however  it appears to be unlikely that we will recover our capitalized drilling and completion costs on these wells through future production from only these wells 
depending on our evaluations of these wells and the results of future drilling activities in our east texas bossier play  we may record impairments of proved properties related to these wells in future periods 
gain on property sales gain on sales of property and equipment for was million compared to million in in  we sold all of our producing and non producing acreage in pecos county  texas for million  net of closing costs  and recorded a gain of approximately million in connection with this sale 
exploration costs since we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved acreage impairments are expensed 
in  we charged to expense million of exploration costs  as compared to million in most of the costs were incurred in louisiana 
at december   our capitalized unproved oil and gas properties totaled million  of which approximately million was attributable to unproved acreage 
unproved properties are subject to a valuation impairment to the extent the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated fair value 
therefore  our results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected by unproved property impairments 
we plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development activities in  of which approximately is expected to be allocated to exploration activities 
since exploratory drilling involves a high degree of risk  it is likely that a significant portion of the costs we incur in will be charged to exploration costs 
however  we cannot predict our success rates and  accordingly  cannot predict our exploration costs related to abandonment and impairment costs 
contract drilling services in april  we formed larclay jv  a joint venture with lariat to construct  own  and operate new drilling rigs 
we own a equity interest in larclay jv 
although the company and lariat own equal interests in larclay jv  we meet the definition of the primary beneficiary of larclay jv s expected cash flows under fin r 
as the primary beneficiary under fin r  we are required to include the accounts of larclay jv in our consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we included contract drilling revenues of million  other operating expenses of million  depreciation expense and impairment of property and equipment of million and interest expense of million in our statement of operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
since the larclay jv drilling rigs are partially utilized by us  the reported amounts are net of any intercompany profits eliminated in consolidation 
general and administrative expenses g a expenses increased from million in to million in excluding non cash employee compensation  g a expenses increased from million in to million in due primarily to higher professional fees and personnel costs 
in  we recorded a million non cash compensation charge related to our after payout incentive plan and  for stock based employee compensation 
in  we recorded a million non cash charge related to our after payout incentive plan and a  non cash charge for stock based employee compensation 
interest expense interest expense increased from million in to million in due to a combination of factors 
in and  we used our revolving loan facility to partially finance our exploration and development activities 
the average daily principal balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility for was million compared to million for capitalized interest for was million compared to million in we also included million of interest expense associated with our larclay jv during compared to  in gain loss on derivatives we did not designate any derivative contracts in or as cash flow hedges  therefore all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark to market valuations have been recorded as gain loss on derivatives 
for  we reported a million net loss on derivatives  consisting of an million non cash loss to mark our derivative positions to their fair value at december  and a million realized loss on settled contracts 
for  we recorded a net gain on derivatives of million  consisting of a million non cash gain related to changes in mark to market valuations and a million realized loss on settled contracts 
other loss on sale of assets for was million compared to  for the charge was due to recording losses on inventory which included a charge of million to write down inventory to its estimated market value at march  the write down resulted primarily from the sale of certain surplus equipment at an auction in march other income expense for was income of million compared to expense of million for the period 
the period included a million gain on settlement of litigation 
no lawsuit settlements or write downs of inventory were recorded during the period 
income tax expense benefit our effective income tax rate in of differed from the statutory federal rate of due primarily to increases in the tax provision related primarily to the effects of the recently enacted texas margin tax and certain non deductible expenses  offset in part by tax benefits derived from statutory depletion deductions 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to a group of banks to secure our revolving credit facility 
the banks establish a borrowing base by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties 
we borrow funds on the revolving credit facility as needed to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves 
if product prices decrease  our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base  thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program 
however  the effects of product prices on cash flow can be mitigated through the use of commodity derivatives 
during the last half of  the economic climate in the oil and gas industry experienced a rapid adverse change 
oil and gas prices have fallen drastically  yet the cost of field services have remained relatively high due to a lag in reaction to lower prices on reduced operating activity in the industry 
as a result  we experienced reductions in operating margins during the last half of and reported negative price revisions to our proved reserves due to lower product prices and still relatively high capital and operating costs 
the effects of lower operating margins on our business are significant since they reduce our cash flow from operations and diminish the estimated present value of our oil and gas reserves 
these factors have an adverse affect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base 
downward revisions in estimated proved reserves can adversely affect the amount of funds we can borrow on the credit facility 
lower operating margins also offer us less incentive to assume the drilling risks that are inherent in our business 
in response to decreases in product prices and the resulting effect on our operating margins  we currently plan to reduce capital spending during fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal the indenture governing the issuance of our senior notes due contains covenants that restrict our ability to borrow money 
one such covenant prohibits us from borrowing any additional funds under the revolving credit facility if our outstanding balance on the facility exceeds of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets  as defined in the indenture 
based on current product prices  we do not currently expect this covenant to limit our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility 
however  we could be limited in future periods depending on the extent and severity of the current economic recession 
capital expenditures the following table summarizes  by area  our planned expenditures for exploration and development activities during  as compared to our actual expenditures in actual planned expenditures expenditures year ended year ended percentage december  december  of total in thousands south louisiana permian basin east texas bossier utah california austin chalk trend north louisiana other our planned exploration and development activities for are substantially lower than fiscal actual expenditures in response to the unfavorable economic climate that we are currently experiencing in the oil and gas industry 
for  we currently plan to defer most of our developmental drilling activities in the permian basin  the austin chalk trend and north louisiana  and to significantly reduce our exploration activities in the east texas bossier and south louisiana 
however  our actual expenditures during fiscal may vary significantly from these estimates if our plans for exploration and development activities change during the year 
factors  such as changes in operating margins and the availability of capital resources could increase or decrease our ultimate level of expenditures during fiscal approximately of the planned expenditures relate to exploratory prospects 
exploratory prospects involve a higher degree of risk than developmental prospects 
to offset the higher risk  we generally strive to achieve a higher reserve potential and rate of return on investments in exploratory prospects 
we do not attempt to forecast our success rate on exploratory drilling 
accordingly  these current estimates do not include costs we may incur to complete any future successful exploratory wells and construct the required production facilities for these wells 
also  we are actively searching for other opportunities to increase our oil and gas reserves  including the evaluation of new prospects for exploratory and developmental drilling activities and potential acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties 
we cannot predict our drilling success on exploratory prospects  and our future results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by unsuccessful exploratory drilling results 
we spent million on exploration and development activities during  of which approximately was on exploratory prospects 
we currently plan to spend approximately million for fiscal  of which approximately is estimated to be spent on exploratory prospects 
we financed these expenditures in with cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the sales of certain south louisiana properties  drilling rigs and other assets 
based on preliminary estimates  our internal cash flow forecasts indicate that our anticipated operating cash flow will be sufficient to finance our exploration and development activities through although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in our forecasts are reasonable  we are unable to predict the extent and duration of lower operating margins resulting from the current economic depression 
accordingly  cash flow may be less than expected  the availability of funds under the credit facility may be less than expected  or capital expenditures may be more than expected 
in the event we lack adequate liquidity to finance our expenditures through fiscal  we will consider options for obtaining alternative capital resources  including selling assets or accessing capital markets 
because of significant uncertainties regarding the current economic environment  we can give no assurance that these alternative capital resources can be obtained on terms acceptable to us 
cash flow provided by operating activities substantially all of our cash flow from operating activities is derived from the production of our oil and gas reserves 
we use this cash flow to fund our on going exploration and development activities in search of new oil and gas reserves 
variations in cash flow from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased million  or  as compared to the corresponding period in approximately million of the increase in operating cash flow was attributable to larclay jv 
all of larclay jv s cash flow is dedicated to the repayment of a million secured term loan facility see larclay jv 
the remainder of the increase in operating cash flow was derived primarily from oil and gas producing activities  offset in part by increases in production costs and seismic expense 
credit facility a group of banks have provided us with a revolving credit facility on which we have historically relied for both our short term liquidity working capital and our long term financing needs 
the funds available to us at any time under this revolving credit facility are limited to the amount of the borrowing base established by the banks 
as long as we have sufficient availability under this credit facility to meet our obligations as they come due  we will have sufficient liquidity and will be able to fund any short term working capital deficit 
during  we reduced indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility by million  primarily with the proceeds from the sales of assets and from the early termination of derivative contracts 
at december   we had a borrowing base of million  leaving million available under the revolving loan facility after accounting for outstanding letters of credit of  this borrowing base is scheduled for redetermination in may using the revolving credit facility for both our short term liquidity and long term financing needs can cause unusual fluctuations in our reported working capital  depending on the timing of cash receipts and expenditures 
on a daily basis  we use most of our available cash to pay down our outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility  which is classified as a non current liability since we currently have no required principal reductions 
as we use cash to pay a non current liability  our reported working capital decreases 
conversely  as we draw on the revolving credit facility for funds to pay current liabilities such as payables for drilling and operating costs  our reported working capital increases 
also  volatility in oil and gas prices can cause significant fluctuations in reported working capital as we record changes in the fair value of derivatives from period to period 
for these reasons  the working capital covenant related to the revolving credit facility requires us to include the amount of funds available under this facility as a current asset  exclude current assets and liabilities related to the fair value of derivatives  and exclude current maturities of vendor finance obligations  if any  when computing the working capital ratio at any balance sheet date 
working capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
since compliance with financial covenants is a material requirement under the credit facilities  we consider the loan compliance working capital to be useful as a measure of our liquidity because it includes the funds available to us under the revolving credit facility and is not affected by the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of derivatives 
our reported working capital deficit decreased from million at december  to a positive million at december  due primarily to a combination of factors  including an increase in cash and a decrease in the net liability for the fair value of derivatives 
after giving effect to the adjustments  our working capital computed for loan compliance purposes was a positive million at december   as compared to a positive million at december  the following table reconciles our gaap working capital to the working capital computed for loan compliance purposes at december  and december  december  in thousands working capital deficit per gaap add funds available under the revolving credit facility exclude fair value of derivatives classified as current assets or current liabilities exclude current assets and current liabilities of larclay jv working capital per loan covenant since we use this revolving credit facility for both short term liquidity and long term financing needs  it is important that we comply in all material respects with the loan agreement  including financial covenants that are computed quarterly 
the working capital covenant requires us to maintain positive working capital using the computations described above 
another financial covenant under the credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of indebtedness to cash flow of no more than to while we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants at december   our increased leverage and reduced liquidity may result in our failing to comply with one or more of these covenants in the future 
if we fail to meet any of these loan covenants  we would ask the banks to allow us sufficient time to obtain additional capital resources through alternative means 
if a suitable arrangement could not be reached with the banks  the banks could accelerate the indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the pledged assets 
the banks redetermine the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility at least twice a year  in may and november  and may request an unscheduled borrowing base redetermination at other times during the year 
the borrowing base was reduced in may from million to million in connection with our sale of certain properties in south louisiana 
in june  we elected to maintain the borrowing base at million instead of increasing it to levels supported by the collateral values assigned by the banks 
if at any time  the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding indebtedness  we will be required to pledge additional collateral  prepay the excess in not more than five equal monthly installments  or elect to convert the entire amount of outstanding indebtedness to a term obligation based on amortization formulas set forth in the loan agreement 
at december   we had million outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
senior notes due in july  we issued  in a private placement  million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the senior notes were issued at face value and bear interest at per year  payable semi annually on february and august of each year  beginning february  after the payment of transaction expenses  net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay amounts outstanding on our secured credit facilities and for general corporate purposes  including the funding of planned exploration and development activities 
at any time prior to august   we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed  plus a make whole premium  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
on and after august   we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at redemption prices expressed as percentages of principal amount equal to for the twelve month period beginning on august   for the twelve month period beginning on august   and beginning on august   for any period thereafter  in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to borrow money  issue redeemable or preferred stock  pay distributions or dividends  make investments  create liens without securing the notes  enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries  sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies  enter into transactions with affiliates  guarantee indebtedness  and enter into new lines of business 
one such covenant restricts our ability to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility if our outstanding balance on the facility is greater than million and exceeds of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets  as defined in the indenture 
based on current economic conditions  we do not expect this covenant to limit our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility in these covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications as described in the indenture 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  larclay jv we own a equity interest in larclay jv  a joint venture with lariat to construct  own and operate drilling rigs 
in  larclay jv obtained a million secured term loan facility from a lender to finance the construction and equipping of the drilling rigs 
the larclay jv term loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of larclay jv 
as additional credit support  we granted the lender a limited guaranty in the original amount of million 
the maximum obligation under the guaranty reduces by on april of each year  beginning april  at december   our maximum obligation under the guaranty was approximately million 
although we are not obligated under the larclay jv term loan except to the extent of the guaranty  we are required to fully consolidate the accounts of larclay jv under fin r 
the principal balance outstanding on the larclay jv term loan at december  was million 
the larclay jv term loan  bears interest at a floating rate based on a libor average  plus  and provides for monthly principal and interest payments sufficient to retire the principal balance by in the first year  in each of the next two years  and in the fourth year 
the larclay jv term loan prohibits larclay jv from making any cash distributions to lariat or us until the balance on the term loan is fully repaid  and repayments by larclay jv of any loans by lariat or us are subordinated to the loans outstanding under the term loan and are subject to other restrictions 
since inception of this joint venture  we have made advances structured as subordinated loans to larclay jv totaling million  million to finance excess construction costs and million to finance our share of working capital assessments made by larclay jv 
lariat has also advanced larclay jv million for its share of working capital assessments 
loans to larclay jv by lariat and us are due on demand and bear interest  payable monthly  at the same rate as the term loan 
however  these loans are subject to a subordination agreement with the larclay jv lender that imposes restrictions on payments of principal and interest on the loans 
in connection with the formation of larclay jv  we entered into a three year drilling contract with larclay jv assuring the availability of each drilling rig for use in the ordinary course of our exploration and development drilling program throughout the term of the drilling contract 
the drilling contract  which is pledged as collateral to secure the larclay jv term loan  expires on the earlier of december  or the termination and liquidation of larclay jv 
the provisions of the drilling contract provide that we contract for each drilling rig on a well by well basis at then current market rates 
if a drilling rig is not needed by us at any time during the term of the contract  larclay jv may contract with other operators for the use of such drilling rig  subject to certain restrictions 
if a drilling rig is idle  the contract requires us to pay larclay jv an idle rig rate ranging from  per day to  per day plus crew labor expenses  if applicable  depending on the size of the drilling rig 
our maximum potential obligation to pay idle rig rates over the remaining term of the drilling contract  excluding any crew labor expenses  totals approximately million at december  during most of  the larclay jv drilling rigs were being utilized primarily by lariat and us in our respective drilling programs 
however  the material deterioration in oil and gas prices  which began in the second half of and has continued into the first quarter of  has resulted in a significant reduction in drilling activity throughout the oil and gas industry 
as of march   all but two of the larclay jv drilling rigs were idle  and those two drilling rigs are expected to be idle by the end of april we do not expect utilization of the larclay jv drilling rigs to improve for the remainder of if the drilling rigs remain idle  we may be required under the drilling contract with larclay jv to pay up to million to larclay jv in these payments will provide larclay jv with adequate cash flow to meet its debt service obligations under the term loan through if the drilling rigs remain idle beyond and larclay jv is not able to meet its debt service obligations under the term loan  we may be required under the guaranty to make debt service payments on term loan on behalf of larclay jv 
we are currently assessing our options with respect to our investment in and obligations to larclay jv 
these options may include debt restructuring  asset sales  and termination and liquidation of larclay jv 
on march   we and lariat entered into an agreement pursuant to which lariat has agreed to assign all of its right  title and interest in and to the larclay jv to us effective as of april  the effective date  and we have agreed to assume all of the obligations and liabilities of lariat under the larclay jv from and after the effective date  including lariat s obligations as operator of the larclay jv drilling rigs 
after giving effect to the assignment to us by lariat  we will own of the larclay jv see item b other information larclay jv 
alternative capital resources although our base of oil and gas reserves  as collateral for both of our credit facilities  has historically been our primary capital resource  we have in the past  and we believe we could in the future  use alternative capital resources  such as asset sales  vendor financing arrangements  and or public or private issuances of common stock 
we could also issue senior or subordinated debt or preferred stock in a public or a private placement if we choose to raise capital through either of these markets 
while we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternatives  if needed  there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us

known trends and uncertainties operating margins we analyze  on a mcfe produced basis  those revenues and expenses that have a significant impact on our oil and gas operating margins 
our weighted average oil and gas sales per mcfe have been on an upward trend  from per mcfe in  per mcfe in and per mcfe in however  our expenses per mcfe have also been on an upward trend and are resulting in a narrowing operating margin 
our oil and gas dd a per mcfe has increased from per mcfe in and to per mcfe in an upward trend in dd a per mcfe indicates that our cost to find and or acquire reserves is increasing at a faster rate than the reserves we are adding 
although we replaced of our production in  our cost to find those reserves was significantly higher than our historical combined rate 
also affecting our operating margins is the cost of producing our reserves 
our production costs per mcfe have fluctuated from per mcfe in  to per mcfe in  to per mcfe in the rise in operating costs per mcfe in was due primarily to higher costs of field services and increased production taxes resulting from higher commodity prices 
during the last half of  the economic climate in the oil and gas industry experienced a rapid adverse change 
oil and gas prices have fallen drastically  yet the cost of field services have remained relatively high due to a lag in reaction to lower prices on reduced operating activity in the industry 
as a result  our operating margins for are expected to be lower than those experienced in recent years 
while we believe that supply and demand fundamentals will ultimately reduce the cost of field services if oil and gas prices remain low  we cannot predict the timing or extent of any improvements in our operating margins 
oil and gas production as with all companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production  we face the challenge of natural production decline since oil and gas reserves are a depletable resource 
with each unit of oil and gas we produce  we are depleting our proved reserve base  so we must be able to conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties with proved reserves in order to grow our reserve base 
prior to our production had been on a gradual decline since due to the effects of natural production decline  offset in part by reserve additions through exploration and development and acquisitions 
in  our production increased to bcfe from bcfe in  and we replaced of our oil and gas production through extensions and discoveries 
while these reserve additions will contribute favorably to our production in  we do not expect this production to be sufficient to fully offset the natural production declines from our base of oil and gas reserves 
as discussed above  we are currently experiencing lower operating margins resulting from declines in product prices and relatively high costs of field services 
lower operating margins offer us less incentive to assume the drilling risks that are inherent in our business 
as a result  we currently plan to reduce capital spending during fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal reduced spending levels may adversely impact our ability to replace our production with new reserves 
failure to maintain or grow our oil and gas reserves may result in lower production and may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates summary in this section  we will identify the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our financial statements and disclosures 
many of these policies require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise 
we explain the nature of these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following table lists our critical accounting policies  the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies  and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies estimates or assumptions accounts affected successful efforts accounting reserve estimates oil and gas properties for oil and gas properties valuation of unproved accumulated dd a properties provision for dd a judgment regarding status of in progress exploratory wells impairment of unproved properties abandonment costs dry hole costs impairment of proved reserve estimates and related oil and gas properties properties and long present value of future net contract drilling equipment lived assets revenues proved properties accumulated dd a estimates of future undiscounted impairment of proved properties cash flows long lived assets and long lived assets asset retirement obligations estimates of the present value abandonment obligations of future abandonment costs non current liability oil and gas properties accretion of discount expense significant estimates and assumptions oil and gas reserves reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate depends on the quality of available geological and engineering data  the precision of and the interpretation of that data  and judgment based on experience and training 
annually  we engage independent petroleum engineering firms to evaluate our oil and gas reserves 
as a part of this process  our internal reservoir engineer and the independent engineers exchange information and attempt to reconcile any material differences in estimates and assumptions 
while we believe this reconciliation process improves the accuracy of the reserve estimates by reducing the likelihood of a material error in judgment  it is possible that in exchanging information  our internal reservoir engineer could influence the independent engineer s estimates and assumptions 
the techniques used in estimating reserves usually depend on the nature and extent of available data  and the accuracy of the estimates may vary accordingly 
as a general rule  the degree of accuracy of reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data  as shown in the following table 
type of reserves nature of available data degree of accuracy proved undeveloped data from offsetting wells  seismic data least accurate proved developed non producing logs  core samples  well tests  pressure data more accurate proved developed producing production history  pressure data over time most accurate assumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves 
volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable reserves exceed the projected revenues from the reserves 
but more significantly  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is extremely sensitive to prices and costs  and may vary materially based on different assumptions 
sec financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be tied to the price received for oil and natural gas on the effective date of the reserve report 
this requirement can result in significant changes from period to period given the volatile nature of oil and gas product prices  as illustrated in the following table 
standardized measure proved reserves average price of discounted oil a gas oil a gas future mmbbls bcf bbl mcf net cash flows in millions as of december a includes natural gas liquids 
valuation of unproved properties placing a fair market value on unproved properties also known as prospects is very subjective since there is no quoted market for undeveloped exploratory prospects 
the negotiated price of any prospect between a willing seller and willing buyer depends on the specific facts regarding the prospect  including the location of the prospect in relation to known fields and reservoirs  available markets and transportation systems for oil and gas production in the vicinity  and other critical services  the nature and extent of geological and geophysical data on the prospect  the terms of the leases holding the acreage in the prospect  such as ownership interests  expiration terms  delay rental obligations  depth limitations  drilling and marketing restrictions  and similar terms  the prospect s risk adjusted potential for return on investment  giving effect to such factors as potential reserves to be discovered  drilling and completion costs  prevailing commodity prices  and other economic factors  and the results of drilling activity in close proximity to the prospect that could either enhance or condemn the prospect s chances of success 
asset retirement obligations we are required by sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations to estimate the present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we compute our liability for asset retirement obligations by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows related to each property 
this requires us to use significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligations 
effects of estimates and assumptions on financial statements generally accepted accounting principles do not require  or even permit  the restatement of previously issued financial statements due to changes in estimates unless such estimates were unreasonable or did not comply with applicable sec accounting rules 
we are required to use our best judgment in making estimates and assumptions  taking into consideration the best and most current data available to us at the time of the estimate 
at each accounting period  we make a new estimate using new data  and continue the cycle 
you should be aware that estimates prepared at various times may be substantially different due to new or additional information 
while an estimate made at one point in time may differ from an estimate made at a later date  both may be proper due to the differences in available information or assumptions 
in this section  we will discuss the effects of different estimates on our financial statements 
provision for dd a we compute our provision for dd a on a unit of production method 
each quarter  we use the following formulas to compute the provision for dd a for each of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities dd a rate unamortized cost beginning of period reserves provision for dd a dd a rate current period production reserve estimates have a significant impact on the dd a rate 
if reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods  the dd a rate for that property or group of properties will increase as a result of the revision 
alternatively  if reserve estimates are revised upward  the dd a rate will decrease 
impairment of unproved properties each quarter  we review our unproved oil and gas properties to determine if there has been  in our judgment  an impairment in value of each prospect that we consider individually significant 
to the extent that the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of unproved properties  and record the provision as abandonments and impairments within exploration costs on our statement of operations 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the prospect at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
impairment of proved properties each quarter  we assess our producing properties for impairment 
if we determine there has been an impairment in any of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities  we will estimate the value of each affected property 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  the value for this purpose is a fair value instead of a standardized reserve value as prescribed by the sec 
we attempt to value each property using reserve classifications and pricing parameters similar to what a willing seller and willing buyer might use 
these parameters may include escalations of prices instead of constant pricing  and they may also include the risk adjusted value of reserves that do not qualify as proved reserves 
to the extent that the carrying cost for the affected property exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of proved properties 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the property at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
accordingly  the carrying costs of producing properties on our balance sheet will vary from and often will be less than the present value of proved reserves for these properties 
judgment regarding status of in progress wells on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each in progress well to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting 
cumulative costs on in progress wells remain capitalized until their productive status becomes known 
if an in progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful often referred to as a dry hole prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we write off all costs incurred through the balance sheet date to abandonments and impairments expense  a component of exploration costs 
costs incurred on that dry hole after the balance sheet date are charged to exploration costs in the period incurred 
occasionally  we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of our financial statements 
in these cases  we leave the well classified as in progress until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations and to evaluate the pertinent geological and geophysical and engineering data obtained 
at the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well s productive status  the well is removed from the in progress status and the proper accounting treatment is recorded 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to oil and gas properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the statement of operations 
during  we had a downward revision of our estimated asset retirement obligations by million based on a review of current plugging and abandonment costs 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion expense 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission sec released final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the new disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes 
the new requirements also will allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require companies to a report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserves audit  and c report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices 
the new disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending on or after december  the effect of adopting the sec rule has not been determined  but it is not expected to have a significant effect on our reported financial position or results of operations

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s our business is impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks  describe our strategy for managing such risks  and to quantify the potential affect of market volatility on our financial condition and results of operations 
oil and gas prices our financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
we cannot predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a decline in the price per bbl of oil and a 
decline in the price per mcf of gas from year end would reduce our gross revenues for the year ending december  by million 
from time to time  we utilize commodity derivatives  consisting primarily of swaps  floors and collars to attempt to optimize the price received for our oil and natural gas production 
when using swaps to hedge our oil and natural gas production  we receive a fixed price for the respective commodity and pay a floating market price as defined in each contract generally nymex futures prices  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
when purchasing floors  we receive a fixed price put strike price if the market price falls below the put strike price for the respective commodity 
if the market price is greater than the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
costless collars are a combination of puts and calls  and contain a fixed floor price put strike price and ceiling price call strike price 
if the market price for the respective commodity exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike prices  no payments are due from either party 
the commodity derivatives we use differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation that requires or permits the future physical delivery of the hedged products 
we do not enter into commodity derivatives for trading purposes 
in addition to commodity derivatives  we may  from time to time  sell a portion of our gas production under short term contracts at fixed prices 
the decision to initiate or terminate commodity hedges is made by management based on its expectation of future market price movements 
we have no set goals for the percentage of our production we hedge and we do not use any formulas or triggers in deciding when to initiate or terminate a hedge 
if we enter into swaps or collars and the floating market price at the settlement date is higher than the fixed price or the fixed ceiling price  we will forego revenue we would have otherwise received 
if we terminate a swap  collar or floor because we anticipate future increases in market prices  we may be exposed to downside risk that would not have existed otherwise 
the following summarizes information concerning our net positions in open commodity derivatives applicable to periods subsequent to december   all of which were entered into subsequent to december  the settlement prices of commodity derivatives are based on nymex futures prices 
swaps gas oil mmbtu a price bbls price production period st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter a one mmbtu equals one mcf at a btu factor of  interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk on our long term debt with a variable interest rate 
at december   our fixed rate debt had a carrying value of million and an approximate fair value of million  based on current market quotes 
we estimate that the hypothetical change in the fair value of our long term debt resulting from a basis point change in interest rates would be approximately million 
based on our outstanding variable rate indebtedness at december  of million  a change in interest rates of basis points would affect annual interest payments by million
