item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people with diabetes  obesity and other diseases through the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative medicines 
we have developed and gained approval for two first in class medicines to treat diabetes  byetta exenatide injection and symlin pramlintide acetate injection  both of which were commercially launched in the united states during the second quarter of byetta was approved in the european union  or eu  in and our collaboration partner  lilly has commercially launched byetta in countries as of december  our near term business strategy is to create value for patients and our stockholders by capitalizing on market drivers  such as the ada s recent inclusion of byetta as the only new addition to their treatment guidelines 
our focus remains on increasing byetta and symlin revenue  submitting a new drug application  or nda  for exenatide once weekly  significantly improving operating results and progressing toward positive operating cash flow by the end of our long term strategy is focused on making prudent investment decisions based on strong clinical data to advance our obesity program 
we intend to finalize our obesity funding and development strategy by the end of byetta is the first and only approved medicine in a new class of compounds called glucagon like peptide  or glp  receptor agonists 
we began selling byetta in the united states in june byetta is approved in the united states for the treatment of patients with type diabetes who have not achieved adequate glycemic control and are using metformin  a sulfonylurea and or a tzd  three common oral therapies for type diabetes 
in october  the ada and the european association for the study of diabetes  or easd  updated their type diabetes treatment guidelines  placing the glp receptor agonist class  of which byetta is the only approved product  as a secondary treatment option for type diabetes patients 
in august  the fda updated a prior alert for byetta referencing pancreatitis 
prescriptions declined in the second half of during that time period we committed our field resources to educating the medical community on the facts about byetta  pancreatitis  and the product s safety profile 
we believe the decline in byetta prescriptions and demand for the products stabilized at the end of the fourth quarter of net product sales of byetta were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we have an agreement with lilly for the global development and commercialization of exenatide 
this agreement includes byetta and any sustained release formulations of exenatide such as exenatide once weekly  our once weekly formulation of exenatide for the treatment of type diabetes 
under the terms of the agreement  operating profits from products sold in the united states are shared equally between lilly and us 
the agreement provides for tiered royalties payable to us by lilly based upon the annual gross margin for all exenatide product sales  including any long acting release formulations  outside of the united states 
royalty payments for exenatide product sales outside of the united states will commence after a one time cumulative gross margin threshold amount has been met 
we expect royalty payments to commence in lilly is responsible for of the costs related to development of twice daily byetta for sale outside of the united states 
development costs related to all other exenatide products for sale outside of the united states will continue to be allocated to lilly and to us 
lilly will continue to be responsible for commercialization and all of the costs related to commercialization of all exenatide products for sale outside of the united states 
symlin is the first and only approved medicine in a new class of compounds called amylinomimetics 
we began selling symlin in the united states in april symlin is approved in the united states for the treatment of patients with either type or type diabetes who are treated with mealtime insulin but who have not achieved adequate glycemic control 
in early  we commercially launched the symlinpen and symlinpen pen injector devices in the united 
table of contents states 
these new pre filled pen injector devices feature simple  fixed dosing to improve mealtime glucose control 
net product sales of symlin were million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
we have a field force of approximately people dedicated to marketing byetta and symlin in the united states 
our field force includes our specialty and primary care sales forces  a managed care and government affairs organization  a medical science organization and diabetes care specialists 
in addition  lilly co promotes byetta in the united states 
in may  we amended our united states co promotion agreement with lilly  resulting in a increase in the total number of sales representatives promoting byetta beginning july  to achieve this increase  lilly s existing third party sales force for cialis tidalafil co promotes byetta in the united states and we increased the number of sales representatives in its existing primary care sales force by approximately 
in exchange for lilly sharing in of the costs related to our additional sales representatives and paying of the costs of the third party sales force discussed above  our primary care sales force co promotes cialis in the united states 
we are currently evaluating this element of the co promotion arrangement with lilly 
in addition to our marketed products  we are working with lilly and alkermes to develop exenatide once weekly 
we are also working with parsons on the construction of a manufacturing facility for exenatide once weekly in ohio 
we substantially completed the construction of this facility in we are now manufacturing exenatide once weekly at commercial scale in this facility and we began supplying clinical trials with this material in the third quarter of in october we entered into a commercial supply agreement with lilly  pursuant to which we will supply exenatide once weekly for sale in the united states  if approved 
in addition we will supply lilly with commercial quantities of exenatide once weekly for sale by lilly outside of the united states  if approved 
under the terms of this agreement  lilly made a million cash payment to us in october representing an amount to compensate us for our cost of carrying lilly s share of the capital investment in our exenatide once weekly manufacturing facility in ohio 
in addition to the million cash payment  we will recover lilly s share of the over million capital investment in the facility through an allocation of depreciation to cost of goods sold in accordance with our collaboration agreement with lilly 
the total amount that will ultimately be recovered from lilly will be dependent upon the proportion of product supplied for sale in the united states  the cost of which is shared equally by the parties  and the proportion of the product supplied for sale outside the united states  the cost of which is paid for by lilly 
we also entered into a loan agreement with lilly under which we may borrow up to million beginning on december  and ending on june   with maturity no later than june  during the second quarter of  we held our pre nda meeting with the fda to discuss open items for our exenatide once weekly regulatory submission 
based on the pre nda meeting and our ongoing dialog with the fda  we continue to believe that the pacing item for an nda submission is to collect sufficient data to demonstrate the comparability between material manufactured by alkermes in its facility and used in previous clinical studies and the commercial scale material produced in our ohio facility 
in december  we announced that the fda has indicated that data from an ongoing extension of our duration study could be used to demonstrate comparability 
acceptance by the fda of the comparability data is dependent upon the duration study extension results that we expect to have in early although we believe that our exenatide once weekly nda submission is on track to be completed in the first half of  if we are required to initiate a new clinical study to demonstrate comparability  the timing of the nda submission would depend on the parameters of the new study  and our submission could be delayed 
in  we will continue to focus on building a superior profile for exenatide once weekly by conducting three clinical trials that will compare exenatide once weekly against competing products 

table of contents the objective of these studies is to support the launch of exenatide once weekly and demonstrate superiority and the transformational nature of our exenatide once weekly therapy 
in november  we announced a strategic restructuring and workforce reduction that reduced the size of our san diego workforce by approximately  or employees 
the goal of the restructuring was to better align our cost structure with anticipated revenues and is part of our business plan to achieve positive operating cash flow by the end of we believe we have the appropriate resources to market byetta and symlin  bring exenatide once weekly to market as soon as possible  and continue to advance our obesity programs 
our long term growth strategy is focused on making prudent investment decisions based on strong clinical data to advance our obesity program and includes our into strategy 
in november  we announced that overweight or obese subjects in a week proof of concept study treated with a combination of pramlintide  an analog of human amylin and the same active ingredient in symlin  and metreleptin  an analog of human leptin  lost an average of pounds from baseline  resulting in reduced body weight on average of 
in we plan to continue the development of a potential obesity medicine that is a combination of pramlintide and metreleptin and the development of a second generation amylinomimetic  now known as davalintide formerly known as ac  which we have now moved into phase clinical trials 
by the end of  we intend to finalize our obesity funding and development strategy 
although our efforts will remain primarily focused on our near term opportunities including byetta  symlin and exenatide once weekly and select investments in our obesity programs  we also maintain an active discovery research program focused on novel peptide and protein therapeutics and are actively seeking to in license additional drug candidates 
we have also made a number of strategic investments and collaborations for the potential development of additional drug candidates 
since our inception in september  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs and  more recently  to the commercialization of our products 
all of our revenues prior to may were derived from fees and expense reimbursements under our byetta collaboration agreement with lilly  previous symlin collaborative agreements  and previous co promotion agreements 
during the second quarter of  we began to derive revenues from product sales of byetta and symlin 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
additionally we have future availability of million beginning december  pursuant to the loan agreement with lilly 
although we may not generate positive operating cash flows for the next few of years  we intend to improve our operating results and reduce our use of cash for operating activities from current levels to achieve our goal to be operating cash flow positive by the end of additionally  we expect that our use of cash for capital expenditures will decrease significantly from levels following the substantial completion of our manufacturing facility in ohio in refer to the discussions under the headings liquidity and capital resources below and cautionary factors that may affect future results in part i  item a for further discussion regarding our anticipated future capital requirements 
recent developments diabetes byetta communicated the addition of glp receptor agonist class  of which byetta is the only approved product  to the ada and easd treatment guidelines as a secondary treatment option for type diabetes patients 

table of contents initiated co promotion of byetta with third party lilly primary care sales force  increasing the sales force promoting byetta by effective july  exenatide once weekly announced that the ongoing extension of the duration study is appropriate to use as the basis for demonstrating comparability between intermediate scale clinical trial material made in alkermes manufacturing facility  and commercial scale drug product made at amylin s manufacturing facility based on feedback from the us food and drug administration fda and reaffirmed plans for exenatide once weekly nda submission to the fda by the end of the first half of completed enrollment of duration and duration  the second and third studies in a planned program of superiority clinical studies of exenatide once weekly 
results for duration  comparing exenatide once weekly against a tzd and a dipeptidyl peptidase dpp inhibitor on a background of metformin therapy  are expected in the second quarter of results for duration  comparing exenatide once weekly to insulin glargine in patients using oral diabetes medications are expected in the third quarter of initiated duration  the fourth study in a planned program of superiority clinical studies of exenatide once weekly 
results for duration  comparing exenatide once weekly as a monotherapy treatment to either metformin  a tzd or a dpp inhibitor are expected in executed an exenatide once weekly supply agreement with lilly  under which lilly made an initial payment of million to amylin in the fourth quarter of in addition  lilly extended a million line of credit to amylin 
these agreements underscore amylin s and lilly s commitment to the successful commercialization of exenatide once weekly  strengthen amylin s balance sheet and provide additional financial flexibility 
announced results from a week open label clinical study that showed the durable efficacy of exenatide once weekly 
patients taking exenatide once weekly experienced an average ac decline of percent with pound weight loss  and over the course of one year  sustained a similar improvement in glucose control compared to those receiving treatment for weeks 
symlin published data showing that the use of mealtime symlin with basal insulin therapy for weeks resulted in more patients with type diabetes achieving improved glucose control  without weight gain or hypoglycemia compared to the use of rapid acting insulin with basal insulin 
commercially launched the symlinpen and the symlinpen pen injector devices for administering symlin in the united states in january these new pre filled pen injector devices feature simple  fixed dosing to improve mealtime glucose control 
obesity programs presented novel data on amylin s promising obesity pipeline at the obesity society s scientific conference that supported the therapeutic potential of the integrated neurohormonal approach to obesity pharmacotherapy 
completed enrollment of a phase b study to evaluate different dosing combinations of pramlintide and metreleptin 
the objective of this dose ranging study is to support dose selection for phase  and to guide the development of a delivery system for this combination regimen 
results from this study are expected in the second half of 
table of contents completed enrollment of a phase clinical study of davalintide  our second generation amylinomimetic 
results from this study are expected in the second half of financial and operational implemented a strategic restructuring that reduced our san diego workforce by approximately and announced our business plan to achieve positive operating cash flow by the end of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory costs  research and development expenses and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements on page f 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  license fees and milestones earned and for reimbursement of development costs based on contractual arrangements 
net product sales we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors  who in turn  sell to retail pharmacies  pharmacy benefit managers and government entities 
decisions made by these wholesalers and their customers regarding the level of inventories they hold  and thus the amount of product they purchase  can materially affect the level of our product sales in any particular period 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when delivery has occurred  title has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and the company has no further obligations 
the company records allowances for product returns  rebates and wholesaler chargebacks  wholesaler discounts and prescription vouchers 
we are required to make significant judgments and estimates in determining some of these allowances 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we will be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
product returns we do not offer our wholesale customers a general right of return 
however  we will accept returns of products that are damaged or defective when received by the wholesale customer or for any unopened product during the period beginning six months prior to and up to months subsequent to its expiration date 
we estimate product returns based on our historical returns experience 
additionally  we consider several other factors in our estimation process including our internal sales 
table of contents forecasts  the expiration dates of product shipped and third party data to assist us in monitoring estimated channel inventory levels and prescription trends 
actual returns could exceed our historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns due to factors such as wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and inventory levels and or competitive changes 
to date actual returns have not differed materially from our estimates 
rebates and wholesaler chargebacks allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the medicaid drug rebate program and contracted discounts with commercial payors 
rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector eg medicaid benefit providers 
the allowance for rebates is based on contractual discount rates  expected utilization under each contract and our estimate of the amount of inventory in the distribution channel that will become subject to such rebates 
our estimates for expected utilization for rebates are based on historical rebate claims and to a lesser extent third party market research data 
rebates are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
wholesaler chargebacks are discounts that occur when contracted customers purchase directly from an intermediary wholesale purchaser 
contracted customers  which currently consist primarily of federal government entities purchasing off the federal supply schedule  generally purchase the product at its contracted price  plus a mark up from the wholesaler 
the wholesaler  in turn  charges back to the company the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contracted price paid to the wholesaler by the customer 
the allowance for wholesaler chargebacks is based on expected utilization of these programs and reported wholesaler inventory levels 
actual rebates and wholesaler chargebacks could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future participation in these programs 
to date  actual rebate claims and wholesaler chargebacks have not differed materially from our estimates 
wholesaler discounts wholesaler discounts consist of prompt payment discounts and distribution service fees 
we offer all of our wholesale customers a prompt pay discount within the first days after the date of the invoice 
distribution service fees arise from contractual agreements with certain of our wholesale customers for distribution services they provide to us and are generally a fixed percentage of their purchases of our products in a given period 
prompt payment discounts and distribution service fees are recorded as a reduction to gross sales in the period the sales occur 
the allowance for wholesaler discounts is based upon actual data of product sales to wholesale customers and not on estimates 
prescription vouchers prescription vouchers result in amounts owed to pharmacies that have redeemed vouchers for a free prescription 
we provide prescription vouchers to physicians  who in turn distribute them to patients 
patients may redeem a voucher at a pharmacy for a free prescription 
we reimburse the pharmacy for the price it paid the wholesaler for the medicine and record this reimbursement as a reduction to gross sales 
the allowance for prescription vouchers is based on the number of unredeemed vouchers in circulation  and the estimated utilization rate 
the estimated utilization rate is based on our historical utilization rates experience with prescription vouchers 
the allowance for prescription vouchers could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future utilization rates 
to date  actual prescription voucher utilization has not differed materially from our estimates 

table of contents revenues under collaborative agreements amounts received for upfront product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
non refundable amounts received for substantive milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone and the expiration of stock conversion rights  if any  associated with such payments 
amounts received for equalization of development expenses are recognized in the period in which the related expenses are incurred 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
valuation of stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires us to expense the estimated fair value of non cash  stock based payments to employees 
we estimate the fair value of stock based payments to employees using the black scholes model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of inputs that require us to make significant estimates and judgments 
these inputs include the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of employee stock options  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate volatility based upon the historical volatility of our common stock for a period corresponding to the expected term of our employee stock options and the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock with various maturities between six months and two years  consistent with the guidance in sfas no 
r and the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we estimated volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock for a period corresponding to the expected term of our employee stock options 
the determination to use implied volatility in addition to historical volatility was based upon the availability of data related to actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that the addition of implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
the expected life of our employee stock options represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding in consideration of historical exercise patterns and the assumption that all outstanding options will be exercised at the mid point of the then current date and their maximum contractual term 
the risk free interest rates are based on the yield curve of united states treasury strip securities in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of our employee stock options 
we have never paid dividends and do not anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we have assumed no dividend yield for purposes of estimating the fair value of our stock based payments to employees 
if factors underlying the above assumptions change in future periods  the associated estimated non cash  stock based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
inventories and related reserves inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods for symlin and byetta 
we maintain inventory reserves primarily for production failures and potential product expiration 
the manufacturing processes for our products are complex 
deviations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures and additional inventory reserves 
obsolete inventory due to 
table of contents expiration may also result in additional inventory reserves 
in estimating inventory obsolescence reserves  we analyze the shelf life  expiration dates and internal sales forecasts  each on a product by product basis 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries  benefits  bonus  stock based compensation  license fees  milestones under license agreements  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  and develop drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
differences between actual clinical trial costs from estimated clinical trial costs have historically not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credits 
subject to certain limitations  these deferred tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods 
since we have been unprofitable since inception and the likelihood of future profitability is not assured  we have reserved for most of these deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
if we determine that we are able to realize a portion or all of these deferred tax assets in the future  we will record an adjustment to increase their recorded value and a corresponding adjustment to increase income in that same period 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation number  or fin and fasb staff position  or fsp  fin effective january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we had no cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption due to a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results could be materially impacted

results of operations net product sales net product sales for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and consisted of sales of byetta and symlin  less allowances for product returns  rebates and wholesaler chargebacks  wholesaler discounts  and prescription vouchers 

table of contents the following table provides information regarding net product sales in millions year ended december  byetta symlin the increases in net product sales for byetta and symlin for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in and the increases in net product sales for byetta and symlin for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily reflect continued growth in patient demand and the impact of price increases 
sales of our products in future periods may be impacted by numerous factors  including potential competition  the potential approval of additional products including exenatide once weekly  regulatory matters  including potential label changes for byetta  economic factors and other environmental factors 
revenues under collaborative agreements the following table summarizes the components of revenues under collaborative agreements for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  amortization of up front payments recognition of milestone payments cost sharing payments substantially all of the revenue recorded in these periods consists of amounts earned pursuant to our byetta collaboration agreement with lilly and consists primarily of the continued amortization of up front payments  milestone payments and cost sharing payments to equalize development expenses for byetta and exenatide once weekly 
the million decrease in revenues under collaborative agreements in  as compared to  primarily reflects increased cost sharing payments partially offset by a reduction in milestone payments 
the increase in cost sharing payments in  as compared to  reflects lilly s reimbursement to us for increased development expenses for exenatide one weekly 
there were no milestone payments in  compared to million in milestone payments in earned primarily upon lilly s launch of byetta in the european union in the million increase in revenues under collaborative agreements in  as compared to  primarily reflects increases in milestone payments due to the recognition of million in milestone payments discussed above and increased cost sharing payments 
the increase in cost sharing payments in  as compared to  primarily reflects lilly s reimbursement for increased development expenses incurred by us for exenatide once weekly 
in future periods  we expect that revenues under collaborative agreements will consist of ongoing cost sharing payments from lilly for sharing of development costs  possible future milestone payments  continued amortization of the million portion of the up front payment received from lilly upon signing of our collaboration agreement in and  following the commercial launch of exenatide once weekly  the amortization of a portion of the million cash payment received in connection with the exenatide once weekly supply agreement discussed above 
the amount of cost sharing revenue recorded will be dependent on the timing  extent and relative proportion of total development costs for 
table of contents the exenatide once weekly and byetta development programs incurred by us and by lilly 
the receipt and recognition as revenue of future milestone payments is subject to the achievement of performance requirements underlying such milestone payments 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million  representing a gross margin of  million  representing a gross margin of  and million  representing a gross margin of  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost of goods sold is comprised primarily of manufacturing costs associated with byetta and symlin sales during the period 
the decrease in gross margin in  as compared to  primarily reflects increased production costs for byetta due to lower production volumes  increases in inventory reserves and product mix  including the introduction of the symlinpen  partially offset by higher net sales prices per unit for byetta and symlin 
the improvement in gross margin in  as compared to  primarily reflects a higher average net sales price per unit for byetta and lower unit costs for byetta resulting from higher production volumes 
annual fluctuations in gross margins may be influenced by production volumes  product mix  pricing and the level of sales allowances 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in as compared to reflects slight increases in promotional spending for byetta and symlin and business infrastructure 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease in due our reduced cost structure following our strategic restructuring and workforce reduction implemented during the quarter ended december   discussed below and in note to the accompanying financial statements 
the million increase in as compared to reflects the full annual effect of the expansion of our sales force during the fourth quarter of  increased promotional expenses for byetta and symlin  increased business infrastructure to support our growth and an increase in stock based compensation including costs associated with the adoption of our employee stock ownership plan  or esop  and increased expense from stock options due to growth in our number of employees 
we  along with lilly  are jointly responsible for the co promotion of byetta within the united states  and share equally in sales force costs and external marketing expenses 
accordingly  our selling  general and administrative expenses include our share of these costs in the united states 
research and development expenses currently  our research and development efforts are focused on programs for the treatment of diabetes and obesity in various stages of development 
from inception through  we devoted substantially all of our research and development efforts to symlin 
beginning in  our research and development costs started to include costs for our other drug candidates  primarily byetta and exenatide once weekly 
in we initiated our program for the treatment of obesity with pramlintide and in we commenced our into clinical research program for obesity 
the drug development process in the united states includes a series of steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda  which allows for the initiation of the clinical evaluation of a potential drug candidate in humans 
clinical evaluation is typically comprised of three phases of study phase  phase and phase generally  the majority of a drug candidate s total development costs are incurred during 
table of contents phase  which consists of trials that are typically both the longest and largest conducted during the drug development process 
successful completion of phase clinical testing is followed by the submission of an nda to the fda for marketing approval 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of an nda  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
following initial regulatory approval for a drug candidate  companies generally initiate additional clinical trials aimed at expanding product labeling and market potential 
the timing and costs to complete the successful development of any of our drug candidates are highly uncertain  and therefore difficult to estimate 
our research and development costs are comprised of salaries and bonuses  benefits  non cash stock based compensation  license fees  milestones under license agreements  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  and develop drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs 
we charge direct internal and external program costs to the respective development programs 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs and allow us to increase our pharmaceutical development capabilities 
these consist primarily of facilities costs and other internal shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs 
the following table sets forth information regarding our research and development expenses for our major projects for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  diabetes obesity research and early stage programs indirect costs research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with byetta and exenatide once weekly which are shared by lilly pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
cost sharing payments received by lilly are included in revenues under collaborative agreements 
increased expenditures for our diabetes development programs are generally partially offset by an increase in cost sharing payments from lilly 
cost sharing payments were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in as compared to primarily reflects continued investments in exenatide once weekly  including manufacturing scale up at our ohio manufacturing facility and costs associated with the ongoing duration clinical trials discussed above  and continued investment in our obesity development programs  including costs associated with the ongoing phase b study evaluating pramlintide and metreleptin discussed above 
we expect that research and development expenses will decrease in due to our lower cost structure following the restructuring we implemented in the quarter ended december   discussed below and in note to the accompanying financial statements 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in as

the increase in expenses for our diabetes programs primarily reflects increased expenses for exenatide once weekly associated with manufacturing scale up at third party manufacturers and our manufacturing facility in ohio and expenses associated with a week comparator study of exenatide once weekly injection and byetta taken twice daily in patients with type diabetes we completed in the fourth quarter of collaborative profit sharing collaborative profit sharing was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and consists of lilly s share of the gross margin for byetta sales in the united states 
restructuring in november we announced a strategic restructuring and workforce reduction that reduced the size of our san diego workforce by approximately  or employees 
the goal of the restructuring was to better align our cost structure with anticipated revenues and is part of our business plan to be operating cash flow positive by the end of we believe we have appropriate resources to grow product sales from byetta and symlin and bring exenatide once weekly to market as soon as possible 
in addition  we also consolidated our san diego facilities and have sub leased or intend to sublease exited facilities 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded a charge of million for the year ended december  this charge consists primarily of expenses related to facility leases for exited facilities  including impairments of related tenant improvements and employee separation benefits 
the following table sets forth the components of the restructuring charge in millions year ended december  facility related charges employee separation costs asset impairments other restructuring charges we have substantially completed all of the above activities included in the restructuring plan and all costs associated with the restructuring were incurred during the year ended december  make whole payment on debt redemption in july  we called for the redemption on august  of all our outstanding convertible senior notes due june  or the notes  under a provisional redemption based upon the market price of our common stock exceeding certain thresholds 
all holders elected to convert their notes into shares of our common stock 
in connection with the conversion  we issued approximately million shares  including  shares as a make whole payment  representing per  principal amount of the notes converted less interest actually paid 
in connection with this make whole payment  we recorded a non cash  non operating charge of million during the third quarter of

interest and other expense consist primarily of interest expense resulting from our long term debt obligations and includes interest payments and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest and other expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in compared to primarily reflects additional interest expense for our notes and million long term note payable entered into in december the increase in compared to primarily reflects an increase in additional interest expense for our notes 
loss on impairment of investments we recognized a loss on impairment of investments of million for the year ended december  this primarily represents a recognized million other than temporary impairment loss on an equity investment in a privately held entity based upon our assessment of the entity s financial and technical performance and the entity s ability to raise additional capital in significantly deteriorated financial markets to fund ongoing operations 
we also recognized a million other than temporary impairment loss on a corporate debt security in our investment portfolio based upon our assessment of the impact of bankruptcy proceedings of the issuer on the recoverability of our investment 
at december   gross unrealized losses on our short term investments were million  all of which we determined to be temporary 
net loss our net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the increase in our net loss in compared to primarily reflects the increased expenses  including the restructuring charge  partially offset by the increased net product sales discussed above 
the decrease in our net loss in compared to primarily reflects increased net product sales and revenues under collaborative agreements  partially offset by increased selling  general  and administrative expenses  increased research and development expenses and increased collaborative profit sharing discussed above 
we may incur operating losses for the next few years 
in november we announced our restructuring and our business plan to become operating cash flow positive by the end of however  our ability to reach profitability in the future will be heavily dependent upon the amount of product sales that we achieve for byetta  symlin and exenatide once weekly  if approved and our ability to control our operating expenses  including ongoing expenses associated with the continued commercialization of byetta and symlin  costs associated with the development and commercialization of exenatide once weekly  if approved  and expenses associated with our research and development programs  including our obesity and our early stage development programs and related support infrastructure 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of expenses incurred and revenues recognized 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public sales and private placements of our common and preferred stock  debt financings  payments received pursuant to our byetta collaboration with lilly  reimbursement of symlin development expenses through earlier 
table of contents collaboration agreements  and since the second quarter of  through product sales of byetta and symlin 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to billion at december  and we have future availability of million beginning december  pursuant to the loan agreement with lilly 
in november  following our restructuring  we announced our business plan to be operating cash flow positive by the end of additionally  we expect that our use of cash for capital expenditures will decrease significantly following the substantial completion of our manufacturing facility in ohio in therefore our current business plan does not contemplate a need to raise additional funds from outside sources however  we will continue to evaluate the performance of our business and strategic opportunities which may require us to raise additional funds from outside sources in the future 
if we require additional financing in the future  we cannot assure you that it will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
although we have previously been successful in obtaining financing through our debt and equity securities offerings  there can be no assurance that we will be able to so in the future  especially given the current adverse economic and credit conditions 
we used cash of million  million and million for our operating activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our cash used for operating activities reflect a source of cash due to the million cash payment received from lilly in connection with exenatide once weekly supply agreement signed in october in addition  our cash used for operating activities in included uses of cash due to increases in other current assets and inventories of million and million  respectively and a decrease in payable to collaborative partner of million 
the increase in other current assets reflects prepayments for raw material inventory and the increase in inventories reflects inventory purchases in accordance with contractual agreements 
the decrease in payable to collaborative partner primarily reflects lower gross profit on byetta sales  of which is payable to lilly  in the quarter ending december  as compared to the same period in our cash used for operating activities in included sources of cash for increases in our current liabilities  including an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  an increase of million in accrued compensation  an increase of million in accrued restructuring costs  of which million is classified as current  and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily reflects growth in our expenses generally  and accounts payable timing differences 
the increase in accrued compensation primarily reflects an increased accrual for our esop  which will be funded with shares of our common stock in the quarter ending march  the increase in accrued restructuring costs reflects accrued expenses associated with our recent restructuring and consists primarily of the fair value of net cash payments related to facility lease losses 
our investing activities used cash of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
investing activities in all three years consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments and purchases of property  plant and equipment 
purchases of property  plant and equipment increased to million in  from million in and million in the increases in and primarily reflect costs associated with our manufacturing facility for exenatide once weekly and  to a lesser extent  purchases of tenant improvements  computer software  office equipment and scientific equipment to support our growth 
we expect that our capital expenditures will decrease significantly in following the substantial completion of our ohio manufacturing facility in through december   we had expended in excess of million associated with the construction of this facility which includes costs associated with the construction of the facility  purchase and installation of equipment and capitalized labor and materials required to validate the facility 
we will continue to evaluate potential additional investments in our ohio manufacturing facility during the product lifecycle for exenatide once weekly

in december  we entered into a million credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit and foreign exchange hedging up to the million borrowing limit 
the term loan is repayable on a quarterly basis  with no payments due quarters one through four  of the outstanding principal due quarters five through eleven  and of the outstanding principal due in quarter twelve 
at december  we had an outstanding balance of million under the term loan and had issued million of standby letters of credit under the revolving credit facility 
both loans have a final maturity date of december  interest on the term loan is payable quarterly in arrears at a rate equal to above the london interbank offered rate  or libor  of either one  two  three or six months libor term at our election 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement which resulted in a fixed interest rate of under the term loan 
the interest rate on the credit facility is libor plus or the bank of america prime rate  at our election 
in october  we entered into a loan agreement with lilly pursuant to which lilly will make available to us a million unsecured line of credit that we can draw upon from time to time beginning on december  and ending on june  any interest due under this credit facility will bear interest at the five day average three month libor rate immediately prior to the date of the advance plus and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the first business day of each quarter

excludes long term obligation of million related to deferred compensation  the payment of which is subject to elections made by participants that are subject to change 
in addition  under certain license and collaboration agreements we are required to pay royalties and or milestone payments upon the successful development and commercialization of related products 
we expect to make development milestone payments up to million associated with licensing agreements in the next months 
additional milestones of up to approximately million could be paid over the next ten to fifteen years if development and commercialization of all our early stage programs continue and are successful 
the significant majority of these milestones relate to potential future regulatory approvals and subsequent sales thresholds 
given the inherent risk in pharmaceutical development  it is highly unlikely that we will ultimately make all of these milestone payments  however  we would consider these payments as positive because they would signify that the related products are moving successfully through development and commercialization 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount of product sales we and lilly achieve for byetta and we achieve for symlin and exenatide once weekly  if approved  costs associated with the continued commercialization of byetta and symlin  costs associated with the establishment of our exenatide once weekly manufacturing facility  costs of potential licenses or acquisitions  the potential need to repay existing indebtedness  costs associated with an increase in our infrastructure  our ability to receive or need to make milestone payments  our ability  and the extent to which we establish collaborative arrangements for symlin or any of our product candidates  progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing or defending our patents  competing technological and market developments  and costs of manufacturing  including costs associated with establishing our own manufacturing capabilities or obtaining and validating additional manufacturers of our products  and scale up costs for our drug candidates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in united states government securities  asset backed securities  and debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations with investment grade credit ratings 
these instruments have various short term maturities 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments held are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive investments 
our debt is not subject to significant swings in valuation as interest rates on our debt are fixed 
the fair value of our notes and notes at december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
we have entered into an interest rate swap in connection with our million term loan 
the fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was a liability of million 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
