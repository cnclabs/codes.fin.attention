item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this item contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a  risk factors 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide the reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results 
our md a is presented in six sections executive summary results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commitments summary of critical accounting policies and estimates new accounting standards executive summary trueblue  inc trueblue  we  us  our is an international provider of temporary blue collar staffing 
in  we put approximately  people to work through the following brands labor ready for general labor  spartan staffing for light industrial services  and clp resources  planetechs  and tlc for skilled trades 
headquartered in tacoma  washington  we serve approximately  small to mid sized businesses in the construction  warehousing  hospitality  landscaping  transportation  light manufacturing  retail  wholesale  facilities  sanitation  and aviation industries 
revenue for was billion  a decrease of over the prior year 
the decline for the year consisted of growth from acquisitions completed within the last months offset by a decrease in organic revenue 
growth from acquisitions included several acquisitions 
in we purchased skilled services corporation  a skilled construction trades staffing provider and planetechs  llc  a skilled staffing provider for aviation maintenance and aero space manufacturing 
in we purchased tlc services group  inc  a professional truck driver staffing provider and personnel management  inc  a light industrial staffing company 
the decline in demand for our services accelerated in the fourth quarter 
revenue for the quarter ended december  was million  a decrease of compared to the fourth quarter of the revenue decline for the quarter consisted of growth from acquisitions completed within the last months offset by a decrease in organic revenue 
the us economy is in a recession and as a result we have experienced a significant decrease in demand for blue collar staffing which has negatively impacted our performance 
we believe the markets we serve will continue to remain under pressure until the overall economy stabilizes and begins to grow again 
in response to the recession we have increased the number of branch closings 
primary factors influencing which branches to close included financial performance  ability to consolidate with another branch  tenure and quality of branch management  market potential of branch location  and long term potential of the location 
during  we closed branches and sold the remaining branches in the united kingdom 
we will continue our focus on aggressive cost management and maintaining a strong balance sheet 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased during gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in compared to of revenue during the impact of acquisitions  pricing pressures resulting from the current economic slowdown  and increased wages paid to our temporary workers due to statutory minimum wage increases are the primary causes for the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
the gross profit as a percentage of revenue of acquired companies has been less than that of our core business creating a decrease in the overall blended gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
while we have increased the bill rates to our customers for these pay increases  we have not fully passed through the amount of our standard markup due to an increased level of price sensitivity with our customers associated with slower economic conditions 
pricing pressure on gross profit as a percentage of revenue was partially offset by the improvement in workers compensation expense which is primarily due to continued improvements in accident prevention and risk management

excluding this impairment charge  net income would have been million or per diluted share 
the charge is largely a result of the adverse impact on expected future cash flows related to the current state of the economy 
the charge does not impact the company s current cash  liquidity  or banking covenants 
we expect to continue to face a very difficult economic environment throughout fiscal  both in the us and internationally 
as the global financial crisis has broadened and intensified  other sectors of the global economy have been adversely impacted and a severe global recession of uncertain length now appears likely 
during an economic downturn  businesses generally reduce their use of temporary staffing as they experience a lower level of demand from consumers 
as a result  we expect to face a challenging fiscal because of these economic conditions 
accordingly  we expect to report negative comparable branch sales for fiscal we plan to be disciplined in our approach to new branch openings and closures and adjust as needed in response to further worsening in the economy

goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
net loss for includes a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of million 
we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances arise that indicate an impairment may exist such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
our annual impairment test is performed during the fourth fiscal quarter 
our annual impairment test did not indicate an impairment of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
however  in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant decline in our stock price 
as a result of the decline in stock price  our market capitalization fell significantly below the recorded value of our consolidated net assets 
the reduced market capitalization reflected  in part  the current economic climate as well as expected continued weakness in pricing and demand for our temporary staffing services 
further  page 
table of contents the decline in demand for our services accelerated in the fourth quarter 
revenue for the quarter decreased by compared to the same quarter a year ago 
the revenue decline consisted of growth from acquisitions completed within the last months of  offset by a decline in organic revenue of 
on a monthly same branch basis  the year over year decline dropped from in october to in december 
this decline was not isolated to a particular brand or market 
the decline in revenue and the corresponding decline in operating results as well as expected continued weakness in pricing and demand for our temporary staffing services is expected to continue during the current recession 
accordingly  we performed an interim assessment of goodwill for impairment 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at a reporting unit level 
we have determined that our reporting units are our brands based on our organizational structure and the financial information that is provided to and reviewed by management 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill for the clp resources which includes ssc  spartan staffing which includes pmi and tlc reporting units exceeded their implied fair values and we recorded non cash impairment losses of million  which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on trueblue s consolidated statement of operations 
our assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that as of december   the fair value of each of the labor ready and planetechs reporting units exceeded its carrying value and therefore goodwill was not impaired 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  be reviewed for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as a result of the indicators discussed above  we tested our amortizable intangible assets for impairment and determined that certain intangible assets associated with the clp resources which includes ssc  spartan staffing which includes pmi and tlc asset groups  primarily customer relationships  were impaired mainly due to the revised lower revenue and profit forecasts associated with those customer relationships acquired with the acquisitions of clp  spartan staffing and tlc 
we measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded their estimated fair values  which were based on projected undiscounted future net cash flows 
as a result of this review  we recorded non cash impairment losses totaling million prior to our sfas impairment test 
the non cash impairment loss is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on trueblue s consolidated statement of operations 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense is million for and million and million for and  respectively 
the portion of the million in depreciation and amortization related to the amortization of intangibles as a result of our acquisitions over the past years is million for the portion of the and depreciation of acquired intangibles is million and million  respectively 
the increase during was primarily due to depreciation of our investments in technology and increased amortization of intangibles as a result of the tlc and pmi acquisitions as well as a full year of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of planetechs in the increase during as compared to was primarily attributable to the increased amortization of intangibles as a result of the ssc acquisition and depreciation of our investments in technology 
interest and other income  net 
we recorded net interest and other income of million for compared to million for and million for net interest income was lower primarily due to lower yields on invested cash 
the decrease during compared to was attributable to the use of cash to purchase our common stock and for the acquisition of ssc and planetechs which resulted in a decrease in the amount of cash available for investment 
income tax 
our effective income tax rate was in results for include a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of million 
excluding this impairment charge  net income would have been million or an effective tax rate of as compared to in and in the principal difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective income tax rate results from state income taxes  federal tax credits  tax exempt interest income  and certain non deductible expenses 
our effective tax rate of excluding the effect of the impairment charge was lower than our rate primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters during the second quarter of our effective tax rate was lower than our rate due to the retroactive renewal of certain tax credits and favorable resolution of other income tax matters during the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
our net income and  consequently  our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume  seasonal sales patterns and profit margins 
over the past three years  cash from operations provided approximately million 
page 
table of contents cash flows from operating activities our cash flows provided by operating activities were as follows in thousands net income loss goodwill and intangible asset impairment depreciation and amortization provision for doubtful accounts stock based compensation excess tax benefits from stock based compensation deferred income taxes other operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities  exclusive of businesses acquired accounts receivable income taxes workers compensation accounts payable and accrued expenses other net cash provided by operating activities results for include a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of million related to the company s acquisitions over the past five years 
excluding this impairment charge  net income would have been million 
the charge is largely a result of the adverse impact on expected future cash flows related to the current state of the economy 
the charge does not impact the company s current cash  liquidity  or banking covenants 
the increased depreciation and amortization is primarily due to amortization of intangibles resulting from our acquisitions over the past years 
amortization of acquired intangibles is million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in february  we acquired tlc which specializes in providing professional truck drivers and logistics personnel to the transportation and distribution industries 
in april  we added branches to our light industrial temporary services with the purchase of pmi 
pmi was integrated with the spartan staffing brand effective december  in december  we acquired planetechs which provides skilled staffing to the aviation maintenance  repair and overhaul  and aerospace manufacturing and assembly industries 
in april  we acquired ssc  a skilled construction trades staffing provider 
ssc was integrated with the clp resources brand 
the change in deferred taxes during is due to increases in deferred tax assets related to the increases in the workers compensation reserve  reserves related to branch closures and contingencies that are not deductible until paid 
changes in accounts receivable during are primarily due to the economic recession and resulting declines in sales and associated receivables 
changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses during are primarily due to the cost control measures and response to the economic recession 
generally  our workers compensation reserve for estimated claims increases as we increase temporary labor services provided 
the rate of increase has slowed with the success of our accident prevention programs and the economic down turn 
the change in income tax receivable during is primarily due to current tax deductions for internally developed software and a corresponding claim for refund of estimated tax payments 
page 
table of contents cash flows from investing activities our cash flows used in investing activities were as follows in thousands capital expenditures purchases of marketable securities maturities of marketable securities acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired change in restricted cash other net cash used in investing activities capital expenditures in  and increased primarily due to significant investments made to upgrade our proprietary systems 
we anticipate that total capital expenditures will be approximately million in we had net maturities of marketable securities in  and net maturities of marketable securities were higher in and as funds that would have been used to purchase additional marketable securities were used to fund share purchases and the acquisitions of ssc  planetechs  tlc  and pmi 
in march  we purchased substantially all of the assets of tlc  a skilled truck driver staffing provider for million 
in april  we purchased pmi  a privately held industrial staffing provider for million 
in april  we purchased ssc  a skilled construction trades staffing provider for million 
in december  we purchased substantially all of the assets of planetechs  a leading provider of aircraft maintenance staffing for million 
the change in restricted cash is primarily due to a decrease in the collateral requirements for our workers compensation program 
cash flows from financing activities our cash flows used in financing activities were as follows in thousands purchases and retirement of common stock net proceeds from sale of stock through options and employee benefit plans shares withheld for taxes upon vesting of restricted stock excess tax benefits from stock based compensation payments on debt other net cash used in financing activities we purchased and retired million  million  and million shares of our common stock in   and  respectively 
future outlook we expect to continue to face a very difficult economic environment throughout fiscal we are in a severe global recession of an uncertain length 
we believe we are in a strong position to cope with the pressure on operating cash flows as highlighted below 
we have a total cash balance of million at december  we have million of borrowing available under our existing credit facility 
our primary credit facility covenant is a debt to ebitda ratio of the ratio at december  is the majority of our workers compensation payments are made from restricted cash versus cash from operations 
at december  approximately two thirds of our workers compensation reserve is covered by restricted cash 
until we see sustained improvement in year over year trends  we will continue to aggressively control costs and conserve available cash 
page 
table of contents capital resources on april   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank and bank of america  which amended and restated the previous revolving credit facility 
the amended and restated credit agreement extended the term of the revolving credit facility from november to april the amended and restated credit agreement provides capacity for the lesser of million  or times ebitda as defined by the amended and restated credit agreement bank ebitda 
the bank ebitda has  among other things  additional items added back to net income including the non cash expenses related to stock options and restricted stock 
in addition  we may request in no more than three instances that the amended and restated credit agreement be increased from million up to million in the aggregate  subject to bank approval 
in light of current credit market conditions  this additional availability could be difficult to obtain  or might not be available under commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
except as set forth above  the amended and restated credit agreement did not materially change the terms of the previous revolving credit facility 
the amended and restated credit agreement  which is secured by substantially all our assets except our real estate  provides us with access to loan advances and letters of credit 
at december   we had million of letters of credit issued against the borrowing capacity leaving us with million available for future borrowings 
there can be no assurance  however  that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by the ongoing credit market instability or that the amount of current available future borrowings will not decrease 
if we needed additional cash  and we were unable to borrow against our credit facility  we would look to asset sales  borrowing against unsecured assets to gain  or looking to the public capital markets to access additional cash 
under current market conditions  however  this may not be possible 
under the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement  we pay a variable rate of interest based on a margin above libor for borrowings and a variable unused commitment fee  both based on a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated bank ebitda the consolidated leverage ratio 
the bank definition of consolidated total debt includes outstanding letters of credit under the amended and restated credit agreement 
fees for letters of credit are based on the margin in effect plus a fee of 
as of december   our margin was and our unused capacity fee was 
if our financial condition deteriorates  our consolidated leverage ratio will rise 
at a consolidated leverage ratio of times  up to our maximum allowable consolidated leverage ratio of times  our margin would be and our unused capacity fee would be 
the amended and restated credit agreement requires that we comply with certain financial covenants 
among other things  these covenants require us to stay below a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  and to stay above a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing an adjusted ebitda by fixed charges 
adjusted ebitda is calculated by removing items such as income tax expense  stock repurchases  capital expenditures  and other items from the bank definition of ebitda 
fixed charges include items such as interest expense  letter of credit fees  principal payments  and other items 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants set forth in the amended and restated credit agreement 
however  should our financial condition deteriorate  our consolidated leverage ratio would rise  and our fixed charge coverage ratio would fall 
at a consolidated leverage ratio above times  we would be in default under the amended and restated credit agreement 
similarly  at a fixed charge coverage ratio below times  we would also be in default 
this would require us to put up cash to back the letters of credit in order to get the consolidated leverage ratio below times  or renegotiate the consolidated leverage ratio 
in the event of a default  we may not have access to the required cash  or the banks may be unwilling to renegotiate the covenant 
we have agreements with certain financial institutions through our wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary  workers assurance of hawaii  inc our workers assurance program  that allow us to restrict cash for the purpose of providing cash backed instruments for our workers compensation collateral 
these instruments include cash backed letters of credit  cash held in trusts  as well as cash deposits held by our insurance carriers 
at december   we had restricted cash in our workers assurance program totaling million 
of this cash  million was committed to insurance carriers leaving million available for future needs 
the majority of our collateral is held by aig commercial insurance aigci  a subsidiary of american international group  inc aig 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  and december  is cash held within branch cash dispensing machines cdms for payment of temporary payrolls in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we believe that cash provided from operations and our capital resources will be adequate to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve months 
however  should economic conditions further deteriorate  our financial results would be page 
table of contents adversely impacted and we may need to seek additional sources of capital 
these additional sources of financing may not be available  or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
workers compensation collateral and claims reserves we provide workers compensation insurance for our temporary and permanent employees 
while we have primary responsibility for all claims  our insurance coverage provides reimbursement for certain losses and expenses beyond our deductible limits 
our workers compensation insurance policies are renewed annually 
we had coverage with various insurance subsidiaries of aigci for occurrences during the period from july to july and renewed our coverage with aigci effective july to july for workers compensation claims originating in states where we are self insured  the majority of our current workers compensation insurance policies cover claims for a particular event above a million deductible limit  on a per occurrence basis 
this results in our being substantially self insured 
furthermore  we have full liability for all further payments on claims which originated between january and june  without recourse to any third party insurer as the result of a novation agreement we entered into with kemper insurance company in december our workers compensation reserve is established using estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  as well as those that have been incurred but not reported 
generally  our workers compensation reserve for estimated claims increases as temporary labor services are provided and decreases as payments are made on these claims 
although the estimated claims are expensed as incurred  the claim payments are made over a weighted average period of approximately six years 
we maintain reserves for workers compensation claims  including the excess claims portion above our deductible limits  using actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses 
our workers compensation claims reserves are discounted to their estimated net present value using discount rates based on average returns of risk free us treasury instruments with maturities comparable to the weighted average lives of our workers compensation claims 
at december   our reserves are discounted at rates ranging from to 
our workers compensation reserves include not only estimated expenses for claims within our self insured limit but also estimated expenses related to claims above our deductible limits 
we record an estimated receivable for the insurance coverage on excess claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have with insurance companies 
we discount this receivable to its estimated net present value using the risk free rates associated with the weighted average lives of our excess claims 
the weighted average claim lives are actuarially determined 
when appropriate  based on our best estimate  we record a valuation allowance against the insurance receivable to reflect amounts that may not be realized 
throughout the year  management evaluates the adequacy of the workers compensation reserves in conjunction with an independent quarterly actuarial assessment 
factors we consider in establishing and adjusting these reserves include the estimates provided by our independent actuaries  appropriate discount rates  and estimated payment patterns 
factors that have caused our estimated losses for prior years to change include  among other things  inflation of medical and indemnity costs at a rate higher than originally anticipated  regulatory and legislative developments that have increased benefits and settlement requirements in several states  a different mix of business than previously anticipated  the impact of safety initiatives implemented  and positive or adverse development of claim reserves 
adjustments to prior period reserves are charged or credited to expense in the period in which the estimate changes 
due to the timing difference between recognition of expense and claim payments we generally anticipate that our reserves will continue to grow 
changes in reserve estimates are reflected in the income statement in the period when the changes in estimates are made 
changes related to prior years reserves net of discount were million for the fifty two weeks ended december  and million for the fifty two weeks ended december  we are required by our insurance carriers and certain state workers compensation programs to collateralize a portion of our workers compensation obligation with cash and cash backed instruments  irrevocable letters of credit  or surety bonds 
aigci holds the majority of the restricted cash collateralizing our self insured workers compensation policies 
in connection with the renewal of our policy  insurance carriers annually assess the amount of collateral they will require from us relative to our workers compensation obligation for which they become responsible should we become insolvent 
such amounts can increase or decrease independent of our assessments and reserves 
we generally anticipate that our collateral obligations will continue to grow 
should our financial results deteriorate  our insurance carriers may require additional collateral  or we may see a shortening of the amount of time that the insurance carriers allow us to pay our premiums and deposit collateral 
for our most recent insurance renewal  we were allowed to pay our premiums and page 
table of contents deposit our collateral in twelve monthly installments 
if our financial condition deteriorates  the insurance carriers may require us to pay these amounts over a shorter period  or all up front 
at december  and december  we had provided our insurance carriers and certain states with commitments in the form and amounts outlined below in millions december  december  workers assurance program committed collateral letters of credit surety bonds other cash backed instruments total collateral commitments the majority of our committed collateral is held at aigci we had and million of restricted cash collateralizing our surety bonds at december  and december   respectively we have agreements with certain financial institutions through our wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary  workers assurance of hawaii  inc our workers assurance program  that allow us to restrict cash for the purpose of providing cash backed instruments for our workers compensation collateral 
our workers assurance program cash and cash backed instruments include cash backed letters of credit  cash held in trusts and cash deposits held by our insurance carriers 
the fees related to those instruments subject to an annual fee were approximately as of december  our surety bonds are issued by independent insurance companies on our behalf and bear annual fees based on a percentage of the bond  which is determined by each independent surety carrier  but do not exceed of the bond amount  subject to a minimum charge 
the terms of these bonds are subject to review and renewal every one to four years and most bonds can be canceled by the sureties with as little as days notice 
should our financial results deteriorate the surety carriers may require more cash to be deposited to back up the surety bonds that they have issued 
this cash requirement could equal as much as the difference between the total outstanding amount of surety bonds  and the current amount of cash backing them

table of contents summary of critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
workers compensation reserves 
we maintain reserves for workers compensation claims  including the excess claims portion above our deductible  using actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses 
these estimates are impacted by claims that have been reported but not settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves  which reflect potential liabilities to be paid in future periods based on estimated payment patterns  are discounted to estimated net present value using discount rates based on average returns on risk free us treasury instruments  which are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate the reserves regularly throughout the year and make adjustments accordingly 
if the actual cost of such claims and related expenses exceeds the amounts estimated  additional reserves may be required 
our workers compensation reserves include not only estimated expenses for claims within our self insured limit but also estimated expenses related to claims above our deductible limits 
we record an estimated receivable for the insurance coverage on excess claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have with insurance companies 
we discount this receivable to its estimated net present value using the risk free rates associated with the weighted average lives of our excess claims 
the weighted average claim lives are actuarially determined 
when appropriate  based on our best estimate  we record a valuation allowance against the insurance receivable to reflect amounts that may not be realized 
two of the workers compensation insurance companies troubled insurance companies with which we formerly did business are in liquidation and have failed to pay a number of excess claims to date 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical write off experience and current economic data and represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and past due balances are written off when it is probable the receivable will not be collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
our annual impairment test is done during the fourth fiscal quarter 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered not impaired 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of all of our tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining our reporting units  the fair value of a reporting unit  the fair value of assets and liabilities within a reporting unit  and when to test for impairment  requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and page 
table of contents inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  judgments and assumptions are required to allocate assets and liabilities to reporting units 
we test our long lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we measure the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded their estimated fair values  which are based on projected undiscounted future net cash flows 
estimating fair values involves significant assumptions  especially regarding future sales prices  sales volumes  and costs 
reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities 
we have established reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities 
we record a liability when our management judges that it is probable that a legal claim will result in an adverse outcome and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated 
we evaluate this reserve regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed 
if the actual outcome of these matters is different than expected  an adjustment is charged or credited to expense in the period the outcome occurs or the period in which the estimate changes 
income taxes and related valuation allowances 
we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we measure these expected future tax consequences based upon the provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events and past operating results 
new accounting standards on december   we partially adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
our partial adoption is in accordance with fasb staff position no 
effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp 
fsp delays the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis  to fiscal years beginning after november  sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosure about the information used to measure fair value 
sfas clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  sfas establishes a three tier value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
our partial adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows nor do we anticipate further adoption of the provision for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements found in item of part ii of this form k for additional information 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any resulting goodwill  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also provides for disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas r beginning in the first fiscal quarter of  which will be applied prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date 
for acquisitions completed prior to january   the new standard requires that changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period must be recognized in earnings rather than as an adjustment to the cost of the acquisition 
we do not expect this new guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
this fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is prohibited 
the adoption of fsp will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of our investments 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
as of december   our purchased investments included in cash and cash equivalents had maturities of less than days 
therefore  an increase or decrease in interest rates immediately and uniformly by from our year end levels would not have a material effect upon our cash and cash equivalent balances  operating results or cash flows 
we have a certain amount of assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to our international operations 
we have not hedged our foreign currency translation risk and we have the ability to hold our foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and do not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on future operating results or cash flows
