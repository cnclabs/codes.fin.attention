item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share data and unless otherwise indicated we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of rental locations in the united states  canada and mexico 
although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because  as a larger company  we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over smaller competitors 
these advantages include greater purchasing power  the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services as well as with newer and better maintained equipment  and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among branches 
we offer for rent over  classes of rental equipment  including construction equipment  industrial and heavy machinery  aerial work platforms  trench safety equipment and homeowner items 
our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals  sales of used rental equipment  sales of new equipment  contractor supplies sales and service and other 
in  rental equipment revenues represented percent of our total revenues 
in  our strategy aimed at growing our earnings at higher margins  while also continuing to generate significant cash flow 
three key elements of this strategy were refocusing our employees and sales representatives on our core rental business  optimizing the management of our rental fleet  and reducing our operating costs 
our achievements in pursuing this strategy included continued improvement in fleet transfers  which drove fleet transfers to a record billion  on average each quarter on an oec basis  a reduction in our employee headcount from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december   a reduction in our branch network from at december  to at december   a reduction in our selling  general and administrative expenses of  or percent  for  a portion of these reductions are associated with the of savings we realized from our strategic sourcing initiative  which was designed to consolidate our non equipment purchases  bringing the cumulative savings since launching this program in to  contractor supplies gross margin improvement to percent from percent for  reflecting our success in repositioning this business as a complementary offering to equipment rentals  and free cash flow generation of in  compared to in in  we will continue to focus on our core rental business  optimizing fleet management  disciplined cost management and free cash generation 
additionally  we will focus on optimizing our field operations to improve sales force effectiveness  and increasing the proportion of our revenues which come from national account and other large customers 
to the extent we are successful at increasing the proportion of our revenue derived from these customers  we believe that over the long term we can improve our equipment rental gross margins and overall profitability as these accounts tend to have higher utilization and can be serviced more cost effectively 
in  we also intend to actively pursue growth in industrial rentals  where we believe our depth of resources and branch footprint give us a competitive advantage 
moreover  industrial rentals are subject to different cyclical pressures than the commercial construction market  where we are seeing demand continue to soften as spending is curtailed 
although we expect to be a challenging year for both our company and the us equipment rental industry generally  we believe our strategy  coupled with our broad geographic footprint  extensive rental fleet  advanced information technology systems  disciplined purchasing power  industry experience and ability to deliver extraordinary customer service  will position us to weather the economic downturn  and enable us to strengthen our leadership position and improve our returns to stockholders once economic conditions improve 

table of contents in june  we commenced a modified dutch auction tender offer in which we offered to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at a price not less than nor greater than per share 
the tender offer expired in july and  in accordance with the terms of the offer  we accepted for payment an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  for a total cost of including fees and expenses 
the number of shares of common stock purchased in the tender offer represented approximately percent of the total common stock outstanding on the last full trading day prior to the commencement of the offer 
also in june  and in connection with our announcement of the tender offer  we repurchased all of our outstanding series c and series d preferred stock  a substantial majority of which was held by apollo investment fund iv  lp and apollo overseas partners iv  lp prior to this preferred stock repurchase  a majority of the preferred holders had the right to consent to certain transactions by us  including the aforementioned tender offer 
under the definitive repurchase agreement  the total purchase price for the preferred stock was approximately  a portion of which was settled through the issuance by holdings of new percent holdco notes 
in addition  and as a result of the repurchase of the preferred stock  leon black and michael gross  the two directors elected by the former preferred holders in accordance with the terms of the series c preferred stock  resigned from our board 
also in june  holdings  urna and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement providing for a new billion abl facility  in connection with which urna repaid the amounts outstanding under its former revolving credit facility and term loan 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the abl facility  which was subsequently upsized to billion  and the repurchase of the preferred stock  respectively 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report  the company is subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative lawsuits  and recently settled an sec inquiry 
the us attorney s office has also requested information from the company about matters related to the sec inquiry 
as previously discussed  in the third quarter of we settled  without admitting or denying the allegations in the sec s complaint  to the entry of a judgment requiring us to pay a civil penalty of and disgorgement of one dollar and enjoining us from violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws in the future 
we cannot predict the outcome or other consequences of these matters as to the company and  other than the reserve we have recognized as of december  related to our contribution toward the settlement of the in re united rentals  inc securities litigation discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have not accrued any amounts related to their ultimate disposition 
any liabilities resulting from an adverse judgment or settlement of these matters may be material to our results of operations and cash flows during the period incurred

in addition to these matters  diluted loss per share from continuing operations includes a per diluted share preferred stock redemption charge associated with the june repurchase of our series c and d preferred stock 
the preferred stock redemption charge reduces income available to common stockholders for earnings per share purposes  but does not affect net income 
income from continuing operations of  or per diluted share  included an after tax gain of  or per diluted share  related to the december termination of our merger agreement with affiliates of cerberus as well as net after tax foreign currency transaction gains of  or per diluted share 
ebitda gaap reconciliation 
ebitda represents the sum of loss income from continuing operations before benefit provision for income taxes  interest expense  net  interest expense subordinated convertible debentures  depreciation rental equipment  goodwill impairment charge and non rental depreciation and amortization 
pro forma ebitda represents ebitda plus i the sum of the charges related to the settlement of the sec inquiry and branch closures  net  as well as the net foreign currency transaction loss  less ii the sum of the merger termination benefit and net foreign currency transaction gain 
management believes that ebitda and pro forma ebitda provide useful information about operating performance and period over period growth 
however  ebitda and pro forma ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and  accordingly  should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
the table below provides a reconciliation between loss income from continuing operations before benefit provision for income taxes and ebitda and pro forma ebitda 
year ended december  loss income from continuing operations before benefit provision for income taxes interest expense  net interest expense subordinated convertible debentures depreciation rental equipment goodwill impairment charge non rental depreciation and amortization ebitda merger termination benefit net foreign currency transaction loss gain charge related to settlement of sec inquiry branch closure charges  net pro forma ebitda for the year ended december   ebitda decreased  or percent  primarily reflecting lower equipment rental gross profit due to the softening construction environment and the absence of the merger termination benefit  which enhanced our results 
the ebitda decline also reflects reduced sales of contractor supplies  consistent with our strategy to focus on the higher margin core rental business as well as lower new and used equipment sales 
on a pro forma basis  our ebitda declined  or percent  also reflecting lower equipment rental gross profit and reduced revenues from our other lines of business 
we were able to partially offset the impact of these factors with savings realized from our ongoing initiatives to reduce operating costs and  as a result  improved our pro forma ebitda margin by percentage points to percent 
for the year ended december   ebitda increased  or percent  primarily reflecting higher equipment rental gross profit and savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives as well as the 
table of contents merger termination benefit and of net foreign currency transaction gains 
on a pro forma basis  our ebitda increased  or percent  and our margin improved percentage points to percent  also reflecting higher equipment rental gross profit as well as savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives 
revenues 
revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows year ended december  percent change equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenue total revenues equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment  as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery  fuel  repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers 
sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment 
contractor supplies sales include our sales of supplies utilized by contractors  which include construction consumables  tools  small equipment and safety supplies 
services and other revenue includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 
total revenues of billion decreased percent  compared with total revenues of billion in the decrease primarily reflects a percent decrease in equipment rental revenue  a percent decline in contractor supplies sales  a percent decline in used equipment sales  and a percent decline in new equipment sales 
the decrease in equipment rental revenue reflects a percent decline in rental rates and a percentage point decrease in time utilization 
the percent decline in contractor supplies sales reflects the strategic shift we began in the second half of to reposition our contractor supplies business as a complementary offering to our core rental business 
the decline in used equipment sales primarily reflects volume declines as we focus on selling older assets  in line with our life cycle management strategy 
the decline in new equipment sales reflects volume declines 
in  based on our analysis of industry forecasts and with consideration given to the broader economic and credit environment  we expect our total revenues to decline 
total revenues of billion increased percent  compared with total revenues of billion in the increase primarily reflects a percent increase in equipment rental revenue  partially offset by a percent decline in used equipment sales and a percent decline in contractor supplies sales 
the increase in equipment rental revenue reflects a percentage point improvement in time utilization  partially offset by a percent decline in rental rates 
the decline in used equipment sales reflects volume declines and a shift in the mix of equipment sold 
the percent decline in contractor supplies sales is consistent with the strategic shift we began in the second half of to reposition our contractor supplies business 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in applying many accounting principles  we make assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
these assumptions  estimates and judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis 
material changes in these assumptions  estimates and or judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
although actual results may differ from those estimates  we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straight line basis 
our rental contract periods are daily  weekly or monthly 
by way of example  if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily  weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars  and  respectively  we would recognize revenue of per day 
the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of by the monthly term of days 
as part of this straight line methodology  when the equipment is returned  we recognize as incremental revenue the excess  if any  between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write off experience 
our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances  including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 
useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment 
we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives  after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to ten percent of cost 
the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues  and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period 
we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 
purchase price allocation 
we have made a significant number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future 
we allocate the cost of the acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
with the exception of goodwill  long lived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions 
the long lived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment  transportation equipment and real estate 
with limited exceptions  virtually all of the rental equipment that we have acquired through purchase business combinations has been classified as to be used  rather than as to be sold 
equipment that we acquire and classify as to be used is recorded at fair value  as determined by replacement cost to the company of such equipment 
we use third party valuation experts to help calculate replacement cost 
in addition to long lived fixed assets  we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities 
these other assets and liabilities typically include  but are not limited to  parts inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other working capital items 
because of their short term nature  the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities balance sheets 
however  when appropriate  we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence 
the intangible assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill  customer relationships and covenants not to compete 
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
customer relationships and non compete agreements are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows 
evaluation of goodwill impairment 
we have made numerous acquisitions over the years  principally during the period between and  that included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units or our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of stocks of corporations 
table of contents engaged in similar businesses 
we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 
inherent in our development of the present value of future cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital and tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit  and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment 
the following assumptions are significant to our income approach business projections we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels 
these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also serve as key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans over a ten year planning period that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our board of directors  long term growth rates beyond the planning period  we also determine an assumed long term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit s earnings stream is projected to grow 
these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units  and are added to the cash flows projected during our ten year planning period  and discount rates our combined future cash flows are then discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be used by market participants 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
in connection with our fourth quarter goodwill impairment testing  we utilized a discount rate of between percent and percent  which we believe is reasonable 
the market approach is one of the other primary methods used for estimating fair value of a reporting unit 
this assumption relies on the market value market capitalization of companies that are engaged in the same or a similar line of business 
during the fourth quarter of  with the assistance of a third party valuation firm and in connection with the preparation of our year end financial statements  we recognized an aggregate non cash goodwill impairment charge of billion related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment 
the charge reflects the challenges of the current construction cycle  as well as the broader economic and credit environment  and includes billion  reflecting conditions at the time of our annual october testing date  as well as an additional as of december  reflecting further deterioration in the economic and credit environment during the fourth quarter 
substantially all of the impairment charge relates to goodwill arising out of acquisitions made by the company between and income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized 
in the case of deferred tax assets  the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
we generally evaluate projected taxable income over an appropriate 
table of contents period for each jurisdiction to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and  in addition  examine the length of the carryforward to ensure the deferred tax assets are established in an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have provided a partial valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset for state operating loss carryforward amounts 
this valuation allowance was required because it is more likely than not that some of the state carryforward amounts will expire unused 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters 
our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 
reserves for claims 
we are exposed to various claims relating to our business  including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and self insured retentions  which we sometimes refer to as self insurance 
these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel 
these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and  accordingly  the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time 
our methodology for developing self insurance reserves is based on management estimates  which incorporate actuarial valuations that are periodically prepared by our third party actuaries 
our estimation process considers  among other matters  the cost of known claims over time  cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates may change based on  among other things  changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims 
further  these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 
legal contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  which involves an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual  or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination  judgment or settlement occurs

in december  following the termination of that merger agreement  we received a break up fee of other income for includes the income associated with the receipt of the break up fee  net of related transaction costs of other income for also includes of net foreign currency transaction gains relating to intercompany transactions primarily between our canadian subsidiary  whose functional currency is the canadian dollar  and our us subsidiaries  whose functional currency is the us dollar 
because these intercompany transactions do not hedge a foreign currency commitment and have been determined not to be of a long term investment nature  exchange rate movements between the canadian and us dollars are required to be included in income during the period in which exchange rates change 
prior to  we had been reflecting the impact of exchange rate changes on these intercompany transactions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  rather than including them in income 
our results for include the cumulative impact of correcting for this matter

see note to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity 
we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices  which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services  ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes  regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 
as previously discussed  in july  in connection with a modified dutch auction tender offer  we accepted for payment an aggregate of shares of our common stock at a price of per share  for a total cost of including fees and expenses 
also in june  and in connection with our announcement of the tender offer  we repurchased all of outstanding series c and series d preferred stock for approximately pursuant to the repurchase agreement with the preferred holders  holdings issued to the former preferred holders aggregate principal amount of the percent holdco notes  in partial payment of the repurchase price of the preferred stock 
in september  we prepaid of the principal amount of these notes 
in anticipation of the share repurchases  in june holdings  urna  and certain of our subsidiaries  entered into a credit agreement providing for a new billion abl facility  a portion of which is available in canadian dollars  and repaid the outstanding under our former revolving credit facility and term loan 
the balance of the amounts necessary for the share repurchases  the repayment of our former credit facility and term loan  as well as related fees and expenses  was funded with existing cash on hand and through borrowings under the abl facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility 
for additional information concerning the abl facility  which has recently been upsized to billion  and the percent holdco notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 
as of december   we had i of borrowing capacity available under our abl facility  ii of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of cash equivalents at december  consist of high quality  low risk investments 
we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next months 
we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital  ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale  iii payments due under operating leases and iv debt service 
we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash 
in addition  we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate or through the use of additional operating leases 
for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases  see certain information concerning contractual obligations 
the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors  including general economic conditions and growth prospects 
we estimate that our net rental capital expenditures  which we define as purchases of rental equipment less proceeds from sales of rental equipment  for to decline to 
table of contents approximately from in  in line with our expectations for reduced construction activity and a challenging economic environment 
we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of rental and non rental equipment and  if required  borrowings available under our abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 
retirement of senior and senior subordinated notes 
as discussed above  in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased and retired an aggregate of principal amount of our outstanding percent senior notes due  percent senior subordinated notes due and percent senior subordinated notes due interest expense for includes a gain of  representing the difference between the net carrying amount of these securities and the total purchase price of loan covenants and compliance 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of our abl facility  the senior notes  the quips and our accounts receivable securitization facility 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
we consider our most restrictive covenant to be the fixed charge coverage ratio  which is the ratio of our adjusted ebitda to our interest expense  as defined in our abl facility 
the minimum amount permitted under this covenant is to and our actual fixed charge coverage ratio for the year ended december  was to as of december   primarily due to our goodwill impairment charge  we no longer had any restricted payment capacity under our percent senior notes due this depletion limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings  although certain intercompany arrangements are excepted 
sources and uses of cash continuing operations 
during  we i generated cash from operations of  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of and iii received proceeds  net of payments  on debt of  principally related to our abl facility 
we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of  ii repurchase common stock of and iii redeem our preferred stock of during  we i generated cash from operations of including the termination fee we received from cerberus  less transaction related costs of and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of and ii fund payments on debt  net of proceeds received  of additionally  during  we received net proceeds of related to the sale of our traffic control business 
free cash flow gaap reconciliation we define free cash flow as i net cash provided by operating activities continuing operations less ii purchases of rental and non rental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and non rental equipment and excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements 
management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements 
however  free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap 
accordingly  free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities continuing operations purchases of rental equipment purchases of non rental equipment proceeds from sales of rental equipment proceeds from sales of non rental equipment excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements free cash flow 
table of contents in  we generated free cash flow of  compared to in this increase reflects lower capital expenditures in  consistent with our expectation for reduced construction activity and a challenging economic environment  partially offset by lower cash generated from operating activities 
free cash flow  which includes of proceeds related to the termination of the cerberus transaction  increased  compared to excluding the impact of the merger benefit  free cash flow in declined  or percent  primarily reflecting lower cash generated from operating activities 
our credit ratings as of february  were as follows corporate rating outlook moody s b negative s p bb negative fitch b stable following the company s june announcement of the repurchase of its series c and d preferred stock and modified dutch auction tender offer for its common stock  both moody s and standard poor s placed the company on negative outlook  the corporate rating at the time was b and bb  respectively  fitch downgraded the company from bb to b with a stable outlook 
in january  after the company announced its goodwill impairment charge and in recognition of the deteriorating economic environment  moody s downgraded the company to b  while standard poor s affirmed its bb rating 
both rating agencies retained a negative outlook 
fitch has retained its b rating with a stable outlook 
both our ability to obtain financing and the related cost of borrowing are affected by our credit ratings  which are periodically reviewed by these rating agencies 
our current credit ratings are below investment grade and we expect our access to the public debt markets to be limited to the non investment grade segment as long as our ratings reflect a below investment grade rating 
certain information concerning contractual obligations 
the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december  thereafter total debt and capital leases interest due on debt operating leases real estate non rental equipment service agreements purchase obligations subordinated convertible debentures total the payments due with respect to a period represent i in the case of debt and capital leases  the scheduled principal payments due in such period  and ii in the case of operating leases  the minimum lease payments due in such period under non cancelable operating leases plus the maximum potential guarantee amounts associated with some of our non rental equipment operating leases for which we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the lease term will not be less than a specified projected residual value 
estimated interest payments have been calculated based on the principal amount of debt and the effective interest rates as of december  these represent service agreements with third parties to refurbish our aerial equipment and to operate the distribution centers associated with contractor supplies 
as of december   we had outstanding purchase orders with our equipment and inventory suppliers 
these purchase orders  which were negotiated in the ordinary course of business  represent obligations of 
table of contents approximately in the aggregate 
these purchase commitments can be cancelled by us  generally with days notice and without cancellation penalties 
the equipment and inventory receipts from the suppliers for these purchases and related payments to the suppliers are expected to be completed throughout includes interest payments 
this information excludes of unrecognized tax benefits  which are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements  is expected to be paid in  and it is not possible to estimate the time period during which the remaining amounts may be paid to tax authorities 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements 
we lease real estate and non rental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity 
as part of some of our non rental equipment operating leases  we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value 
if the actual residual value for all equipment subject to such guarantees were to be zero  then our maximum potential liability under these guarantees would be approximately under current circumstances we do not anticipate paying significant amounts under these guarantees  however  we cannot be certain that changes in market conditions or other factors will not cause the actual residual values to be lower than those currently anticipated 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  this potential liability was not reflected on our balance sheet as of december  or any prior date as we believe that proceeds from the sale of the equipment under these operating leases would approximate the payment obligation 
relationship between holdings and urna 
holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary  urna  and subsidiaries of urna 
holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to urna in connection with its operations 
these services principally include i senior management services  ii finance and tax related services and support  iii information technology systems and support  iv acquisition related services  v legal services  and vi human resource support 
in addition  holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by urna and its subsidiaries 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 
interest rate risk 
during and earlier periods  we utilized interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of billion 
the effect of the swap agreements was  at december   to convert billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments 
in january  we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements and made a payment of there were no outstanding derivative contracts including interest rate swap or cap agreements at december  as of december   we had an aggregate of of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 
as of december   the variable rate debt included of borrowings under our abl facility and of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december  were i percent for the abl facility and ii percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility 
as of december   based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding  our annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 
the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 
for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents currency exchange risk 
the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar 
as a result  our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 
based upon the level of our canadian operations during relative to the company as a whole  a percent change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings 
we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of december  we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes
