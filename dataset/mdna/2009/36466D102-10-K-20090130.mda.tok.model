our actual results could differ materially from the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in this report  including those set forth under item a  risk factors 
overview we design  develop  and market bingo systems  vlt s  slot machines and related software  and server based wireless gaming systems 
vlt s  slot machines and related software are collectively referred to as box business 
we entered the box business in march with our acquisition of summit gaming for million in cash 
for the weeks ended november  and our fiscal years ended october  and  our portable bingo terminals  fixed base bingo terminals  and box businesses made the following contributions to revenue revenue contribution portable bingo terminals fixed base bingo terminals box equipment as of november   we had bingo systems in service in states  one us territory  various native american locations and in five foreign countries 
we had box sales in states  one us territory  and various native american locations 
we are marketing new server based wireless gaming systems where users play a range of games including bingo  video poker  keno and other slot machine games 
the mini wireless server based gaming system was installed in europe during the second quarter of the elite server based gaming system  was installed domestically in the third quarter of and in europe during the first quarter of fiscal the european configuration supports wireless bingo and fast action gaming for the european bingo market 
we generate revenue by placing electronic bingo systems in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenue generated by each terminal 
revenue growth for our bingo systems is affected by player acceptance of electronic bingo as an addition or an alternative to paper bingo 
additionally  our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand operations into new markets and our ability to increase our market share in our current markets 
fixed base bingo terminals generate greater revenue per terminal than portable bingo terminals  but also require a greater initial capital investment 
we typically install our electronic bingo systems at no charge to our customers  and we capitalize the costs 
for the weeks ending november  and fiscal year ended october   costs of  and  were capitalized  respectively  and amortization occurs over the expected term of the contract 
we record depreciation of bingo equipment over either a three or five year estimated useful life using the straight line method of depreciation 
our box business generates revenue from the sale of boxes new and used  software conversion kits  content fees  license fees  participation fees  parts  and services 
for the weeks ending november  and fiscal year ended october   and  respectively  of our box business sales were derived from the sale of new and used equipment  conversion kits  and parts 
in some instances  we recognize recurring participation revenue in lieu of a one time machine sale 
increasing market share in existing markets and expanding product placement into new markets drives revenue growth 
our bingo and box expenses consist primarily of cost of revenue  general and administrative expense  sales and marketing expense  and research and development expense 
cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with technical and operational support of the bingo systems in bingo halls  depreciation and amortization of bingo terminals  cost of sales related to equipment sold  and repair refurbishment disposal costs of bingo terminals and related support equipment 
general and administrative costs consist of expenses associated with management of our company and the related support  including finance and accounting  legal  compliance  information systems  human resources  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  and amortization of intangible assets acquired from the summit acquisition 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to distributors for promoting and supporting our products  and compensation paid to our internal sales force to manage existing customers  to generate new customers  and sell additional and upgraded equipment 
research and development costs consist of company sponsored activities to provide customers with new or enhanced games or game themes for our vlt and slot machines  improved bingo terminals  and to develop and test new wireless server based systems 
fiscal highlights during the weeks ended november   we incurred a net loss of million  compared to net income of million in fiscal as a result of various factors  including primarily the following million goodwill impairment charge  million decrease in revenue due to a declining economy  increased regional competition and pricing pressures  decreased total cost of revenue of million primarily due to million decrease in depreciation related primarily to certain assets becoming fully depreciated  a decrease of million in cost of goods sold related directly to decreased revenue  offset by an increase of million in refurbishment  disposals  and obsolescence reserve related to bingo equipment as a result of write offs of units and or parts on older product lines  approximately million in pre tax impairment of the value of our investment in auction rate securities  net interest expense increase of million related to the acquisition of our box division as well as million in debt retirement costs associated with the refinancing of our credit facility  million in prepayment penalties and a million charge due to our interest rate swap agreement related to the new credit facility  million increase in research and development expense primarily due to the inclusion of weeks reported for for our box division compared to seven months in fiscal  million increase in amortization of the identifiable intangible assets purchased in the summit gaming acquisition due to the inclusion of weeks reported for during the weeks ending november   our capital expenditures increased approximately  or million to million  from million during fiscal  primarily related to the purchase of our new headquarters in reno  nevada 
fiscal year we have adopted the fifty two fifty three week fiscal year beginning with the period ending on the first sunday in november of the fiscal years ending october  and were both on a twelve month calendar basis 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  bingo terminal depreciation  goodwill impairment  obsolescence  provision for income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement between us and our customer exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we earn our revenue in a variety of ways 
we offer our products for lease or sale 
we also sell service and software updates for equipment previously sold or leased 
bingo equipment revenue is recognized for bingo terminals and bingo systems installed as a single element placed in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenue generated by each terminal 
revenue recognition is a key component of our results of operations  and determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
we recognize revenue when all of the following factors exist a evidence of an arrangement with the customer  b play or availability of the bingo terminals  c a fixed or determinable fee  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
we exercise judgment in assessing the credit worthiness of customers to determine whether collectability is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine the factors are not met for future transactions  revenue recognized for future reporting periods could be adversely affected 
box equipment our product sales revenues are generated from the sale of vlt s  conversion kits  content fees  license fees  participation fees  equipment and services 
in some instances  we recognize recurring participation revenue in lieu of a one time machine sale 
revenues are recorded in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
software revenue recognition and are reported net of discounts  sales taxes and other taxes of a similar nature 
revenues related to contracted production are recognized as the related work is delivered 
we recognize license fee revenues over the term of the associated agreement unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
amounts received prior to completing the earnings process are deferred until revenue recognition criteria are met 
our sales credit terms are predominately days 
in certain limited circumstances  we may extend credit terms up to days 
deferred revenue deferred revenue consists of amounts received or billed after a product is delivered or services are rendered  but prior to meeting all of the requirements for revenue recognition 
complex systems and or multiple element contracts may take several months to complete and our deferred revenues may increase as our products evolve toward a more systems centric environment 
deferred revenue totaled million at november  as compared to million at october   and primarily represents amounts received for future deliverables 
reserve for bingo terminal obsolescence we provide reserves for excess or obsolete bingo terminals on hand that we do not expect to be used 
the reserves are based upon several factors  including our estimated forecast of bingo terminal demand for placement into bingo halls 
the estimates of demand for future bingo terminals may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and or obsolete bingo terminals 
although we attempt to assure the accuracy of our estimated forecasts  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our bingo terminals  results of operations  and financial condition 
software development capitalization we capitalize costs related to the development of certain software products that meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
provides for the capitalization of computer software that is to be used as an integral part of a product or process to be sold or leased  after technological feasibility has been established for the software and all research and development activities for the other components of the product or process have been completed 
we capitalize qualified costs of software developed for new products or for significant enhancements to existing products 
we cease capitalizing costs when the product is available for general release to our customers 
we amortize the costs on a straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product beginning when the product is available for general release 
the achievement of technological feasibility and the estimate of a products economic life require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions  market conditions or other circumstances could result in an impairment of the capitalized asset and a charge to our operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts bingo equipment we estimate the possible losses resulting from non payment of outstanding accounts receivable arising from the lease of our bingo units 
our customer base consists primarily of entities operating in charitable  native american  and commercial bingo halls located throughout the united states  canada  mexico  and the united kingdom 
in some jurisdictions  the billing and collection function is performed as part of a distributor relationship  and in those instances  we maintain allowances for possible losses resulting from non payment by both the customer and distributor 
we perform ongoing evaluations of customers and distributors for credit worthiness  economic trends  changes in customer payment terms  and historical collection experience when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also reserve a percentage of accounts receivable based on aging category 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs of receivables  payment trends  and other available information 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in the financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of estimates of collectability of our receivables 
box equipment we estimate the possible losses resulting from non payment of outstanding accounts receivables arising from the sale of boxes and related equipment 
our customer base consists of casinos located in various states and native american casinos 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and distributors for credit worthiness  economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms  and historical collection experience when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets we review long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of long lived assets are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset undiscounted and without interest 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we review goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter  or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform the impairment analysis of goodwill at a reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
during the year ended november   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to goodwill related to our acquisition of summit 
during the same period  there was no impairment charge for long lived assets 
during the years ended october  and  no impairment charges related to long lived assets and goodwill were recorded 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r accounting for stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we estimate share based compensation at the award grant date and recognize expense over the service period 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the fair value estimate 
judgment is required in estimating stock volatility  forfeiture rates  expected dividends  and expected terms that options remain outstanding 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas no 
r 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition

box net revenues decreased  for the weeks ended november   or to million from million compared to the months ended october  the continued softness in the louisiana market affected vlt sales  as did delays in obtaining approvals on gaming products in montana 
financial results for the box segment may continue to be volatile from quarter to quarter until we have broadened our revenue base by expanding into more vlt markets  and by penetrating into the class iii slot machine markets  such as california and nevada 
cost of revenue bingo cost of revenue for the weeks ended november  decreased to million  or of net revenue  from million  or of net revenue  compared to the months ended october  this decrease is primarily due to million less bingo equipment depreciation over the comparable period in  mainly from travelers becoming fully depreciated in  offset in part by a million increase in the cost of disposals  slow moving and obsolete materials as a result of the write off of units and or parts on older product lines as customers migrate to the newer product lines 
box business cost of revenue decreased to million  or of net revenue for the weeks ended november  from million  or of net revenue compared to the months ended october  the decrease in cost of revenue is primarily related to the decline in sales and the mix of products sold 
gross profit bingo gross profit for the weeks ended november  decreased to million  or of net revenue  from million or of net revenue compared to the months ended october  the decrease in gross profit margin is primarily due to the revenue decline as described above 
box gross profit increased to million  or of net revenue for the weeks ended november   from million or of net revenue compared to the months ended october  the increase is due to an increase in sales of higher margin equipment and software 
operating expenses bingo general and administrative costs decreased to million for the weeks ended november   from million for the months ended october  the decrease is primarily due to lower outside legal fees as the activity on major lawsuits  such as the trend case  has declined since box general and administrative costs increased or million to million for the weeks ended november  from million for the months ended october  primarily due to a full fiscal year of expenses 
amortization of the identifiable intangible assets purchased in the summit gaming acquisition increased million due to the inclusion of weeks reported for compared to months reported for the fiscal year ended october  bingo sales and marketing expenses remained flat for the weeks ended november   compared to the months ended october  a decrease in distributor commissions directly related to the decline in revenue  and a decrease in advertising fees due to canadian legislative changes  was offset by an increase in employee costs related to additional positions 
box sales and marketing expenses remained flat for the weeks ended november   compared to the months ended october  bingo research and development expenses increased by million to million  for the weeks ended november   from million compared to the months ended october  the increase is primarily due to higher employee costs as a result of increased travel costs related to the elite testing in the uk 
box research and development expenses increased million to million for the weeks ended november   from million for the months ended october  the increase in the box business segments is primarily due to a full fiscal year of expenses in  costs expended for developing new product lines  such as the california keno game which was approved in august  new hardware design and software development for a major vlt contract  and increased licensing fees as we expand our distributorship to new markets 
for the weeks ended november   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our acquisition of summit compared to no goodwill impairment charge for the months ended october  there were no gains on the sale of assets for box for the weeks ended november  compared to million related to the months ended october  there were no loss legal contingencies recorded for the weeks ended november   compared to  for the months ended october interest expense interest expense of million for the weeks ended november  increased million over the months ended october  the increase is due to interest paid on debt incurred to purchase summit  debt incurred to purchase our new corporate headquarters in reno  nevada  a prepayment penalty of million as a result of refinancing our credit facility  million as a result of our swap agreement valuation  and million due to the write off of debt acquisition costs associated with our old credit facility 
impairment of investments at november   we held auction rate securities ars with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  the ars held by us at november  experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
we engaged a third party valuation firm to assist us in determining the estimated fair value of these securities as of november  utilizing the standards set forth in fas of the eight ars in our investment portfolio  three of them having an aggregate purchase price of approximately million consisted of level ii securities as defined by fas 
for these securities  fair value was measured using the average sale price of recent observable transactions in the same securities 
the five remaining ars in our investment portfolio having an aggregate purchase price of approximately million were classified as level iii as defined by fas as no direct market inputs to make a pricing determination were available 
a discounted cash flow analysis was used to determine the estimated fair value of these securities 
based largely upon the credit risks of the issuers and the lack of an active trading market in these securities  risk adjusted discount rates were applied to determine the estimated fair value of our level iii ars 
management determined that the estimated losses in these securities were other than temporary and recorded an additional pre tax impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of  resulting in aggregate pre tax impairment charges of approximately million for the weeks ended november  seven of the eight ars in our investment portfolio continue to pay interest according to their stated terms 
goodwill impairment in fiscal  the company acquired the assets of summit gaming and added million to goodwill  which included trade names of million

the company performed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles as of july  based on a combination of factors  including the current economic environment  decreased revenues and increased costs  particularly of the box segment  the company recorded a noncash goodwill impairment associated with our acquisition of summit of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the annual evaluation of goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
income taxes we recorded our income tax provision at an effective rate of for the weeks ended november   compared with for the twelve months ended october  the change in effective rate is primarily due to the goodwill impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of the weeks ended november  for additional information  see critical accounting policies impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets contained herein

us bank na will hold up to million of the new credit facility and bank of the west will hold up to million 
as of november   the balance of the term loan was million  and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver 
the term loan requires monthly interest payments which began on september   and quarterly principal payments of approximately million which began on october   until its maturity on august   when the balance will be due in full 
the interest rate for the term loan varies based upon the one month libor rate plus 
with respect to the term loan  we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement with us bank n 
a  which exchanged the variable one month libor rate of the term loan for a fixed libor rate of per annum effective august   through the maturity of the term loan 
as of november   there was million outstanding under the term loan  and the average interest rate is 
because the interest rate on the term loan is fixed under a libor swap agreement  increases in interest rates will not affect our cash flow 
however  if we find it necessary to accelerate the amortization of the term loan  we could be required to pay early breakage fees on the libor contracts in the event that interest rates decrease 
assuming the million balance outstanding as of november   and the effective rate of interest rate of  our breakage fee on the full outstanding balance if libor declined by basis points would be approximately million  and an increase of basis points would result in a breakage fee of approximately million 
we do not anticipate the need to accelerate that amortization of the term loan at any time for the remainder of fiscal
