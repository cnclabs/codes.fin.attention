overview on assignment  inc is a diversified professional staffing firm providing flexible and permanent staffing solutions in specialty skills including laboratory scientific  healthcare nursing  physicians  medical financial  information technology and engineering 
we provide clients in these markets with short term or long term assignments of contract professionals  contract to permanent placement and direct placement of these professionals 
our business currently consists of four operating segments life sciences  healthcare  physician  and it and engineering 
consolidated revenues increased percent to million in from million in the previous year 
consolidated gross margin improved basis points to percent from percent in and gross profit increased percent to million from million in despite the weakening of the us economy in the latter end of  we were able to grow our revenues and expand our gross margin in however  key indicators of demand have weakened ie permanent placement and conversion revenues  number of new assignments and or terminations  bill pay spread  amount of time it takes customers to make a hiring decision on a qualified candidate and the number of billable hours per contract professional 
we do not expect to see a dramatic improvement in demand for our services in however  we do believe our continued focus on items that are within our control ie  certain factors impacting gross margins  selling  general and administrative sg a expense management and cash generation has us well positioned to confront the current economic environment 
we remain cautious going into given the seasonality of our business  as discussed below  as well as the challenging economic environment in which we are currently operating 
our healthcare  physician and it and engineering segments experienced increased demand in  yet demand weakened in the fourth quarter for our healthcare and it and engineering segments 
the demand for services in our life sciences segment  which is perhaps most related to the general economic conditions  weakened in the initiatives undertaken during the last several years have been key to the growth in revenues and profitability experienced in in january of  we acquired vista staffing solutions  inc vista  a privately owned leading provider of physician staffing  known as locum tenens  and permanent physician search services and oxford global resources  inc oxford  a leading provider of high end information technology and engineering staffing services 
in  we focused on assisting the newly acquired physician and it and engineering segments to continue to perform while integrating with and operating as a part of on assignment 
during the past three years  we focused on diversifying our client mix in the healthcare segment through the expansion of our client base 
we made significant progress in further strengthening the sales force through the hiring of seasoned professionals with staffing industry experience and committing more resources to our newer services lines  local nursing  health information management  clinical research and our two new acquired segments physician and it and engineering 
seasonality demand for our staffing services historically has been lower during the first and fourth quarters due to fewer business days resulting from client shutdowns  adverse weather conditions and a decline in the number of contract professionals willing to work during the holidays 
as is common in the staffing industry  we run special incentive programs to keep our contract professionals  particularly nurses  working through the holidays 
demand for our staffing services usually increases in the second and third quarters of the year 
in addition  our cost of services typically increases in the first quarter primarily due to the reset of payroll taxes 
results of operations the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income changes in results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues 
year ended december  change revenues by segment in thousands life sciences healthcare physician it and engineering total revenues revenues increased million  or percent as a result of growth in our healthcare  physician  it and engineering segments 
the growth was due to both demand in our end markets  as well as an expanded and more experienced sales and fulfillment team 
in the latter half of  we made management changes and realigned certain geographic markets in our healthcare segment in order to generate higher revenue growth 
the period included twelve months of activity from the it and engineering segment  as opposed to only eleven months in the period 
life sciences segment revenues decreased million  or percent 
the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in the average number of contract professionals on assignment  a million  or percent  decrease in conversion fee revenues and the deteriorating foreign exchange rate for the british pound and the euro combined with a deepening recession in the united kingdom and the united states 
these decreases were partially offset by a percent increase in the average bill rate and a million increase in permanent placement fees 
the year over year decrease in revenues is a direct result of our clients decisions to focus more on cost containment than on completing projects  developing new products or enhancing existing product lines during this challenging economic period 
the overall increase in healthcare segment revenues  which include our nurse travel and allied healthcare lines of business  consisted of an increase in both the nurse travel and allied healthcare lines of business revenues

year ended december  gross profit gross margin gross profit gross margin gross profit by segment in thousands life sciences healthcare physician it and engineering total gross profit the year over year gross profit increase was due to growth in revenues in the it and engineering  physician and healthcare segments and a basis point expansion in consolidated gross margin 
the expansion in gross margin was primarily attributable to increases in margins in the physician and healthcare segments and to a higher proportion of revenues from the it and engineering segment  which has higher gross margins than the other segments 
the period included twelve months of reportable activity from the it and engineering segment as compared with only eleven months in the period 
life sciences segment gross profit decreased million  or percent 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a percent decrease in the segment revenues partially offset by an increase of basis points in gross margin

gross margin for the segment increased basis points  primarily due to an increase in bill pay spread and a million  or percent increase in conversion fee revenue  partially offset by a million  or percent increase in other contract employment expenses 
as with our other divisions  to the extent we employ contract professionals  we may see lower gross margins in the first quarter of due to the reset of certain payroll taxes

going forward  we will continue to manage our sg a closely and do not expect any significant changes 
interest expense and interest income 
interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average debt balances in due to million principal payments in  and a decrease in average interest rates during on december  and  the value of our interest rate swap was marked to market  and we recorded a loss of million and million  respectively  for the years then ended  which is shown in interest expense  and the related liability of million and million  respectively  is included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current liabilities

the annual effective tax rate was percent for and changes in results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues 
year ended december  change revenues by segment in thousands life sciences healthcare physician from january    n a it and engineering from january    n a total revenues consolidated year over year revenue growth was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of vista and oxford  completed on january  and january   respectively  and included revenues from their respective date of acquisition 
we also experienced organic growth in our life sciences and healthcare segments 
these organic results were due to both demand in our end markets as well as an expanded and more experienced sales and fulfillment team 
our healthcare segment revenues began to slow in the latter half of the year  driven by slower than expected progress in replacing a large account that closed its acute care facility following its failure to gain government certification  our reduction in placements at another large customer due to pricing  as well as a generally lackluster nurse travel end market 
we made management changes and realigned certain geographic markets to facilitate generating a better growth rate in the segment on a go forward basis 
we continued to focus on the growth of our established product lines as well as our newer product lines  including health information management  clinical research  engineering  local nursing  physician  it and engineering  and further development of our direct hire business 
revenues increased million or percent  from million to million 
this increase was due in great part because of the acquisitions of vista and oxford  which accounted for million of the increase 
in addition  conversion and direct hire fee revenues increased million  or percent  from million  or percent of revenue to million  or percent of revenue 
this was a result of more contract professionals being converted into or hired directly as permanent employees in our legacy businesses  accounting for million of the increase  as well as from conversion and direct hire fee revenues generated in the newly acquired physician and it and engineering segments  which accounted for million of the increase 
continued development of the direct hire business had a favorable impact on our operating results and remained a focus of management 
life sciences segment revenues increased million  or percent  from million to million 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to a percent increase in average bill rates  or approximately million  as well as a percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment  or approximately million

our newer service line offerings  clinical research and engineering  continued to grow by generating a larger number of higher level  higher revenue placements during than  with a percent increase in contract professionals placed in than in the overall increase in healthcare segment revenues  which included our nurse travel and allied healthcare lines of business  resulted from an increase in revenues generated by the allied healthcare line of business while the nurse travel line remained relatively flat for the period 
healthcare segment revenues increased million  or percent  from million to million 
allied healthcare revenues increased million  or percent  from million to million 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to a percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment  or approximately million  as well as a percent increase in conversion and direct hire fee revenues from million to million

year ended december  gross profit gross margin gross profit gross margin gross profit by segment in thousands life sciences healthcare physician from january   n a it and engineering from january   n a total gross profit gross profit increased million from million to million 
gross margins increased basis points from percent to percent 
on a consolidated basis  gross profit and gross margins increased significantly due the acquisitions of vista and oxford completed on january  and january   respectively  and included gross profit from their respective date of acquisition 
the basis point increase in consolidated gross margin year over year was largely attributable to the percent gross margin earned in the it and engineering segment  which consists entirely of the oxford acquisition 
additionally  we experienced margin improvement in both of our historical segments  life sciences and healthcare 
life sciences segment gross profit increased due to an increase in revenues and improved gross margin 
gross margins for the segment increased basis points from percent to percent 
the life sciences segment gross margin increase was primarily related to lower workers compensation expense  an increased bill pay spread and increased direct hire and conversion fee revenues 
direct hire and conversion fee revenues increased million  or percent  from million to million 
increases in direct hire and conversion fee revenues had a positive impact on gross margin as there are no associated costs of services 
gross margins in the first quarter of a year tend to be lower than the fourth quarter of the preceding year due to the reset of certain payroll taxes 
healthcare segment gross profit increased due to an increase in revenues and improved gross margin 
this segment includes gross profit from the nurse travel and allied healthcare lines of business 
gross margin for the segment increased basis points from percent to percent

gross margins in our physician and it and engineering segments were percent and percent  respectively  for the year ended december   and as with our other divisions to the extent we employ contract professionals we may see lower gross margins in the first quarter due to the reset of certain payroll taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased million  or percent  from million to million 
the primary reason for the increase was the acquisitions of vista and oxford in the first quarter of sg a expenses for vista and oxford were million and million  respectively 
in addition to expenses related to increased sales headcount and corporate support personnel associated with the acquisitions  the amortization of intangible assets acquired caused an increase in amortization expense from million to million 
additionally  stock based compensation expense was million versus million 
total sg a as a percentage of revenues increased from percent to percent  primarily due to increased amortization expense related to the acquisition of vista and oxford 
interest expense and interest income 
interest expense was  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense was due to the new million senior secured credit facility we entered into on january  on december   the value of our interest rate swap was marked to market  and we recorded a loss of million for the year then ended  which is shown in interest expense  and the related liability of million is included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current liabilities 
interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income was lower due to a lower average cash balance in versus average interest rates were marginally higher in the period versus the period 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded a tax provision based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately percent while our effective rate was percent for the year ended december  the difference in our effective tax rate for the year ended december  as compared with the corresponding period in was primarily due to the reversal in of the valuation allowance of million that was recorded against our net deferred income tax assets in and of the million valuation allowance reversal  million resulted in an income tax benefit and million was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital resulting from stock option deductions realized in the period 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was million  including million in cash and cash equivalents 
our operating cash flows have been our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
our working capital requirements consist primarily of the financing of accounts receivable  payroll expenses and the required periodic payments of principal and interest on our term loan 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our outstanding common stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared with million in the same period in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net income  adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including a decrease in depreciation and amortization due to a reduction of the amortization for other intangibles in  offset by an increase in prepaid income taxes due to increased operating results and an increase in the medical malpractice provision due to increased claim activity 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the same period in  primarily due to our acquisitions of oxford and vista in capital expenditures related to information technology projects  leasehold improvements and various property and equipment purchases for the year ended december  totaled million  compared with million in the comparable period 
the increase in capital expenditures in primarily related to the conversion of the nurse travel line of business to recruitmax and peoplesoft in the fourth quarter of we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million for net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million for the same period in the significant source of cash provided by financing activities in was due to borrowing activity related to the proceeds from the million term loan facility 
during  we used million to pay down our term loan facility to million 
this payment was sufficient to cover the excess cash flow payment required by the bank as well as all minimum quarterly payments for the next four years through the term loan facility matures on january   at which time we expect the facilities to be renewed 
under terms of the credit facility  we are required to maintain certain financial covenants  including a minimum total leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a limitation on capital expenditures 
in addition  the terms of the credit facility restrict the company s ability to pay dividends of more than million per year 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
the maximum total leverage ratio  which measures the ratio of total debt to trailing twelve months consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of identifiable intangible assets  as defined in the agreement  decreases to from for the twelve months ended september  based on our current operating plan  we believe we will be in compliance with the covenants contained in our term loan facility 
however  such compliance will likely require us to prepay a portion of our term loan prior to september  depending on our operating results 
if the economy continues to worsen  it may impact our ability to meet these covenants 
in order to avoid possible compliance issues related to maximum leverage later in  we will seek an amendment to increase the permitted leverage under our term loan facility 
in april  we paid the earn outs related to the operating performance of vista and oxford acquisitions 
as of december   we have accrued million and million for the payment of the earn outs related to the operating performance of vista and oxford  respectively 
we also filed for claims indemnifiable by the selling shareholders of vista for million  which was recorded as a decrease to goodwill and an increase in other current assets as of december  payment of these earn outs and claim indemnification is tentatively scheduled for april  pending the agreement of all applicable parties to all terms and provisions related to such payments 
we continue to make progress on enhancements to our front office and back office information systems 
these enhancements include the consolidation of back office systems across all corporate functions  as well as enhancements to and broader application of our front office software across all lines of business 
the timing of the full integration of information systems used by vista and oxford will remain a consideration of management 
under our previously board approved stock repurchase program  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a total cost of million through as of december   we had no remaining authorization to repurchase shares 
during  certain stock based awards issued under our approved stock option plan vested 
under the provisions of this plan  a portion of the vested shares were withheld by us in order to satisfy minimum payroll tax obligations of the employee 
the vested shares withheld have been recorded as treasury stock  a reduction to stockholder s equity  at the fair market value on the date that the tax obligation was determined  which was also the vesting date of the awards 
as of december   there were  shares withheld related to stock based awards and included in treasury stock at a fair market value of million 
we believe that our working capital as of december   our credit facility and positive operating cash flows expected from future activities will be sufficient to fund future requirements of our debt obligations  accounts payable and related payroll expenses as well as capital expenditure initiatives for the next twelve months 
commitments and contingencies we lease space for our corporate and branch offices 
rent expense was million in  million in and million in the following table sets forth  on an aggregate basis  at december   the amounts of specified contractual cash obligations required to be paid in the periods shown in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt operating lease obligations accrued earn out payments total for additional information about these contractual cash obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii  item of this report

we also filed for claims indemnifiable by the selling shareholders of vista for million  which was recorded as a decrease to goodwill and an increase in other current assets as of december  payment of the earn outs and claim indemnification is tentatively scheduled for april  pending the agreement of all applicable parties to all terms and provisions related to such payments 
we are partially self insured for our workers compensation liability related to the life sciences  healthcare and it and engineering segments as well as its medical malpractice liability in relation to the physician segment 
in connection with this program  we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the self insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported 
we account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on estimates derived from historical claims experience and current trends of industry data 
changes in estimates  differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made 
the self insurance claim liability was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
additionally  we have letters of credit outstanding to secure obligations for workers compensation claims with various insurance carriers 
the letters of credit outstanding at december  and were million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we have an income tax reserve in other long term liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions of million 
we are involved in various other legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
however  based on the facts currently available  we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had no significant off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and letters of credit outstanding 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
while sfas did not impact the company s valuation methods  it expanded disclosures of assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value 
sfas was effective for financial statements issued for years beginning after november  and interim periods within those years 
the company adopted this standard on january   and the adoption did not have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii  item of this report for the related disclosure 
we are in the process of evaluating the previously deferred provisions of sfas  which was effective on january   for non financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and the impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  with the objective of mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without being required to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the company was required to make an election at the beginning of the year after november  to adopt this standard 
the company did not elect the fair value option 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r expanded the definition of a business  thus increasing the number of transactions that qualify as business combinations 
sfas r requires the acquirer to recognize percent of an acquired business assets and liabilities  including goodwill and certain contingent assets and liabilities  at their fair values at the acquisition date 
contingent consideration is recognized at fair value on the acquisition date  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until settled 
likewise  changes in acquired tax contingencies  including those existing at the date of adoption  are recognized in earnings if outside the maximum allocation period generally one year 
transaction related expenses and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred  and any adjustments to finalize the purchase accounting allocations  even within the allocation period  are shown as revised in the future financial statements to reflect the adjustments as if they had been recorded on the acquisition date 
finally  a gain could result in the event of a bargain purchase acquisition of a business below the fair market value of the assets and liabilities  or a gain or loss in the case of a change in the control of an existing investment 
sfas r is applied prospectively to business combinations with acquisition dates on or after january  adoption did not materially impact the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations directly when it became effective in  as the only impact that the standard had on recorded amounts at adoption was that related to disposition of uncertain tax positions related to prior acquisitions 
following the date of adoption of the standard  the resolution of such items at values that differ from recorded amounts will be adjusted through earnings  rather than through goodwill 
adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on how acquisition transactions subsequent to january  are reflected in our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas  which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of the derivative instruments and hedging activities  the method of accounting for such instruments under sfas no 
and its related interpretations  and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on the company s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas was effective for the company beginning january  we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas may have on our financial statements
