new accounting standards for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company  see the significant accounting policies accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  the company selects the principle or method that is appropriate in its specific circumstances 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in the significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or estimation than other accounting policies 
products liability the company is a defendant in various products liability claims brought in numerous jurisdictions in which individuals seek damages resulting from automobile accidents allegedly caused by defective tires manufactured by the company 
each of the products liability claims faced by the company generally involve different types of tires  models and lines  different circumstances surrounding the accident such as different applications  vehicles  speeds  road conditions  weather conditions  driver error  tire repair and maintenance practices  service life conditions  as well as different jurisdictions and different injuries 
in addition  in many of the company s products liability lawsuits the plaintiff alleges that his or her harm was caused by one or more co defendants who acted independently of the company 
accordingly  both the claims asserted and the resolutions of those claims have an enormous amount of variability 
the aggregate amount of damages asserted at any point in time is not determinable since often times when claims are filed  the plaintiffs do not specify the amount of damages 
even when there is an amount alleged  at times the amount is wildly inflated and has no rational basis 

table of contents the fact that the company is a defendant in products liability lawsuits is not surprising given the current litigation climate which is largely confined to the united states 
however  the fact that the company is subject to claims does not indicate that there is a quality issue with the company s tires 
the company sells approximately to million passenger  light truck  suv  high performance  ultra high performance and radial medium truck tires per year in north america 
the company estimates that approximately million cooper produced tires made up of thousands of different specifications are still on the road in north america 
while tire disablements do occur  it is the company s and the tire industry s experience that the vast majority of tire failures relate to service related conditions which are entirely out of the company s control such as failure to maintain proper tire pressure  improper maintenance  road hazard and excessive speed 
the company s exposure for each claim occurring prior to april  is limited by the coverage provided by its excess liability insurance program 
the program for that period includes a relatively low per claim retention and a policy year aggregate retention limit on claims arising from occurrences which took place during a particular policy year 
effective april   the company established a new excess liability insurance program 
the new program covers the company s products liability claims occurring on or after april  and is occurrence based insurance coverage which includes an increased per claim retention limit  increased policy limits and the establishment of a captive insurance company 
the company accrues costs for products liability at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be estimated 
the company believes the probability of loss can be established and the amount of loss can be estimated only after certain minimum information is available  including verification that company produced products were involved in the incident giving rise to the claim  the condition of the product purported to be involved in the claim  the nature of the incident giving rise to the claim and the extent of the purported injury or damages 
in cases where such information is known  each products liability claim is evaluated based on its specific facts and circumstances 
a judgment is then made to determine the requirement for establishment or revision of an accrual for any potential liability 
the liability often cannot be determined with precision until the claim is resolved 
pursuant to applicable accounting rules  the company accrues the minimum liability for each known claim when the estimated outcome is a range of possible loss and no one amount within that range is more likely than another 
the company uses a range of settlements because an average settlement cost would not be meaningful since the products liability claims faced by the company are unique and widely variable 
the cases involve different types of tires  models and lines  different circumstances surrounding the accident such as different applications  vehicles  speeds  road conditions  weather conditions  driver error  tire repair and maintenance practices  service life conditions  as well as different jurisdictions and different injuries 
in addition  in many of the company s products liability lawsuits the plaintiff alleges that his or her harm was caused by one or more co defendants who acted independently of the company 
accordingly  the claims asserted and the resolutions of those claims have an enormous amount of variability 
the costs have ranged from zero dollars to million in one case with no average that is meaningful 
no specific accrual is made for individual unasserted claims or for premature claims  asserted claims where the minimum information needed to evaluate the probability of a liability is not yet known 
however  an accrual for such claims based  in part  on management s expectations for future litigation activity and the settled claims history is maintained 
because of the speculative nature of litigation in the united states  the company does not believe a meaningful aggregate range of potential loss for asserted and unasserted claims can be determined 
the company s experience has demonstrated that its estimates have been reasonably accurate and  on average  cases are settled at amounts close to the reserves established 
however  it is possible an individual claim from time to time may result in an aberration from the norm and could have a material impact 
the company determines its reserves using the number of incidents expected during a year 
during  the company increased its products liability reserve by million 
the addition of another year of self insured incidents accounted for million of this increase 
the company revised its estimates of future settlements for unasserted and premature claims 
in addition  the company also revised its estimate of the number of additional incidents expected during each year for years subsequent to these revisions increased the reserve by million 
finally  changes in the amount of reserves for cases where sufficient information is known to estimate a liability increased by million 
during  the company increased its products liability reserve by million 
the addition of another year of self insured incidents accounted for million of this increase 
the company revised its estimates of future settlements for unasserted and premature claims 
these revisions increased the reserve by million 
finally  changes in the amount of reserves for cases where sufficient information is known to estimate a liability increased by million 
the time frame for the payment of a products liability claim is too variable to be meaningful 
from the time a claim is filed to its ultimate disposition depends on the unique nature of the case  how it is resolved claim dismissed  negotiated settlement  trial verdict and appeals process and is highly dependent on jurisdiction  specific facts  the plaintiff s attorney  the court s docket and other factors 
given that some claims may be resolved in weeks and others may take five years or more  it is impossible to predict with any reasonable reliability the time frame over which the accrued amounts may be paid 

table of contents during  the company paid million and during  the company paid million to resolve cases and claims 
the company s products liability reserve balance at december  totaled million current portion of million 
at december   the products liability reserve balance totaled million current portion of million 
the products liability expense reported by the company includes amortization of insurance premium costs  adjustments to settlement reserves and legal costs incurred in defending claims against the company offset by recoveries of legal fees 
legal costs are expensed as incurred and products liability insurance premiums are amortized over coverage periods 
the company is entitled to reimbursement  under certain insurance contracts in place for periods ending prior to april   of legal fees expensed in prior periods based on events occurring in those periods 
the company records the reimbursements under such policies in the period the conditions for reimbursement are met 
products liability costs totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and include recoveries of legal fees of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
policies applicable to claims occurring on april   and thereafter  do not provide for recovery of legal fees 
income taxes the company is required to make certain estimates and judgments to determine income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are made in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions such as the us tax incentive for domestic manufacturing activities and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
changes to these estimates will result in an increase or decrease to tax provisions in subsequent periods 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for income tax expense must be increased by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that are deemed to be not recoverable 
the company has maintained a full valuation allowance against its net us deferred tax asset position at december   as it cannot assure the utilization of these assets before they expire 
in the event there is a change in circumstances in the future which would affect the utilization of these deferred tax assets  the tax provision in that accounting period would be reduced by the amount of the assets then deemed to be realizable 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves a degree of uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other jurisdictions based on its estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are more likely than not 
if  and at the time  the company determines payment of such amounts are less likely than not  the liability will be reversed and a tax benefit recognized to reduce the provision for income taxes 
the company will record an increase to its provision for income tax expense in the period it determines it is more likely than not that recorded liabilities are less than the ultimate tax assessment 
the company has adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation number fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies accounting for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not recognition threshold for tax positions 
under fin  the company will initially recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits of the tax position  that such a position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities 
if the tax benefit meets the more likely than not threshold  the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on the company s estimate of the ultimate tax benefit to be sustained if audited by the taxing authority 
the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits for permanent and temporary book tax differences for continuing operations  exclusive of interest  total approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if an indicator of impairment exists for certain groups of property  plant and equipment or definite lived intangible assets  the company will compare the forecasted undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets to their carrying values 
if the carrying values exceed the undiscounted cash flows  the company then determines the fair values of the assets 
if the carrying values exceed the fair values of the assets  then an impairment charge is recognized for the difference 
the company assesses the potential impairment of its goodwill and other indefinite lived assets at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the carrying value of these assets is compared to their fair value 
if the carrying values exceed the fair values  then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is computed and the impairment charge  if any  is then recorded 
as discussed in the footnotes to the financial statements  note goodwill and intangible assets  the company assessed the goodwill and the indefinite lived intangible asset in the north american tire operations segment at december  and determined that impairment existed 
following a review of the valuation of the segment s identifiable assets  the company wrote off the goodwill of the segment 
the company reduced the value of the indefinite lived intangible assets at december  to the value indicated by the annual review 

table of contents during  the company recorded goodwill of million and recorded definite lived intangible assets of million associated with the chengshan acquisition 
at december   the company assessed the goodwill in the international tire operations segment and determined that impairment existed 
following a review of the valuation of the segment s identifiable assets  the company wrote off the goodwill of the segment 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events 
such events may include  but are not limited to  significant industry or economic trends and strategic decisions made in response to changes in the economic and competitive conditions impacting the company s businesses 
pension and postretirement benefits the company has recorded significant pension liabilities in the united states and the united kingdom and other postretirement benefit liabilities in the united states that are developed from actuarial valuations 
the determination of the company s pension liabilities requires key assumptions regarding discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefits payments  expected returns on plan assets and the rates of future compensation increases 
the discount rate is also significant to the development of other postretirement benefit liabilities 
the company determines these assumptions in consultation with its actuaries 
the discount rate reflects the rate used to estimate the value of the company s pension and other postretirement liabilities for which they could be settled at the end of the year 
when determining the discount rate  the company discounted the expected pension disbursements over the next fifty years using citigroup pension discount liability index yield curve rates 
based upon this analysis  the company used a discount rate of percent to measure its united states pension and postretirement benefit liabilities which is unchanged from the rate used at december  a similar analysis was completed in the united kingdom and the company increased the discount rate used to measure its united kingdom pension liabilities to percent at december  from percent at december  the rate of future compensation increases is used to determine the future benefits to be paid for salaried and non bargained employees  since the amount of a participant s pension is partially attributable to the compensation earned during his or her career 
the rate reflects the company s expectations over time for salary and wage inflation and the impacts of promotions and incentive compensation  which is based on profitability 
the company used percent for the estimated future compensation increases in measuring its united states pension liabilities at december  and december  in the united kingdom  the company used percent for the estimated future compensation increase at december  compared to a rate of percent at december  the assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets is applied to the market value of plan assets to derive a reduction to pension expense that approximates the expected average rate of asset investment return over ten or more years 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return will increase pension expense  whereas an increase in the expected long term rate will reduce pension expense 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to increase the amount of pension expense  whereas increases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to decrease the amount of pension expense 
any shortfall in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will increase pension expense in future years due to the amortization of the shortfall  whereas any excess in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will reduce pension expense in future periods due to the amortization of the excess 
the company s investment policy for united states plans assets is to maintain an allocation of percent in equity securities and percent in debt securities 
the company s investment policy for united kingdom plan assets is to maintain an allocation of percent in equity securities and percent in fixed income securities 
equity security investments are structured to achieve a balance between growth and value stocks 
the company determines the annual rate of return on pension assets by first analyzing the composition of its asset portfolio 
historical rates of return are applied to the portfolio 
this computed rate of return is reviewed by the company s investment advisors and actuaries 
industry comparables and other outside guidance is also considered in the annual selection of the expected rates of return on pension assets 
the actual loss on united states pension plans assets approximated percent in compared to an asset return of approximately percent in the actual loss on united kingdom pension plan assets approximated percent in compared to an asset return of percent in the company s estimate for the expected long term return on its united states plan assets was percent which was used to derive pension expense and percent which was used to derive pension expense 
the expected long term return on united kingdom plan assets used to derive the and pension expense was percent and percent  respectively 
the company has accumulated net deferred losses resulting from the shortfalls and excesses in actual returns on pension plan assets from expected returns and  in the measurement of pensions liabilities  decreases and increases in the discount rate and the rate of future compensation increases and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience totaling million at december  these amounts are being amortized in accordance with the corridor amortization requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  over periods ranging from years to years 
amortization of these net deferred losses was million and million in and  respectively 
the company adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas no 
 in and  to mitigate the impact of medical cost inflation on the company s retiree medical obligation  instituted per household caps on 
table of contents the amounts of retiree medical benefits it will provide to future retirees 
the caps do not apply to individuals who retired prior to certain specified dates 
costs in excess of these caps will be paid by plan participants 
the company implemented increased cost sharing in in the retiree medical coverage provided to certain eligible current and future retirees 
since then cost sharing has expanded such that nearly all covered retirees pay a charge to be enrolled 
see item a 
risk factors the company s expenditures for pension and postretirement obligations could be materially higher than it has predicted if its underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect 
on december   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
this statement required the company to recognize the funded status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of its pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans in the december  consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to cumulative other comprehensive loss a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
the adjustment to cumulative other comprehensive loss at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs  all of which were previously netted against the plans funded status in the company s consolidated balance sheets pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
and sfas no 
these amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to the company s historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts 
further  actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic benefit costs in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income 
those amounts will be subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost on the same basis as the amount recognized in cumulative other comprehensive loss at adoption of sfas no 
off balance sheet arrangements certain operating leases related to property and equipment used in the operations of cooper standard automotive were guaranteed by the company 
these guarantees require the company  in the event cooper standard automotive fails to honor its commitments  to satisfy the terms of the lease agreements 
as part of the sale of the automotive operations  the company is seeking releases of those guarantees but to date has been unable to secure releases from certain lessors 
the most significant of those leases is for a us manufacturing facility with a remaining term of eight years and total remaining payments of approximately million 
other leases cover two facilities in the united kingdom 
these leases have remaining terms of five years and remaining payments of approximately million 
the company does not believe it is presently probable that it will be called upon to make these payments 
accordingly  no accrual for these guarantees has been recorded 
if information becomes known to the company at a later date which indicates its performance under these guarantees is probable  accruals for the obligations will be required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates from its financial instruments 
the company actively monitors its exposure to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to reduce the impact of these risks 
see the significant accounting policies derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has estimated its market risk exposures using sensitivity analysis 
these analyses measure the potential loss in future earnings  cash flows or fair values of market sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 
a decrease in interest rates by ten percent of the actual rates would have adversely affected the fair value of the company s fixed rate  long term debt by approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  an increase in interest rates by ten percent of the actual rates for the company s floating rate long term debt obligations would not have been material to the company s results of operations and cash flows 
to manage the volatility of currency exchange exposures related to future sales and purchases  the company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets 
for the residual portion  the company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases options with maturities of less than months pursuant to the company s policies and hedging practices 
the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the fair value of cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
the company s unprotected exposures to earnings and cash flow fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates were not significant at december  and the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
the impact from a ten percent change in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s foreign currency denominated obligations and related foreign exchange contracts would not have been material to the company s results of operations and cash flows
