in january  amvac acquired certain assets associated with the evital g cranberry herbicide business conducted in the united states from syngenta 
in july  amvac acquired from flowserve us inc flowserve  all or substantially all of its assets associated with the smartbox closed delivery system 
the smartbox system electronically dispenses granular crop protection products  replacing older technology that utilizes mechanically driven sprockets and chains 
the state of the art smartbox technology allows farmers to apply crop protection products accurately and efficiently while avoiding contact with the product 
the computer controller enables farmers to monitor and change application rates while planting and provides the farmers with a permanent record of application 
initially the smartbox system was developed by flowserve in partnership with ei dupont de nemours and company dupont and zeneca  inc which partnership commenced in at the same time it acquired certain assets 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries associated with the fortress corn soil insecticide business from dupont in  amvac assumed dupont s smartbox partnership interest 
thereafter  zeneca  inc abandoned its smartbox partnership interest 
in  amvac sold its fortress g active ingredient chlorethoxyfos corn soil insecticide to the american farmer in the smartbox system 
later that year  amvac secured exclusive marketing rights in the us bayer cropscience s aztec g corn soil insecticide which also can be applied through the smartbox system 
by offering both products  amvac provides farmers a choice of two different chemistries to apply through the smartbox system 
this allows farmers to rotate products from year to year  thereby preventing insects from building resistance to any one specific product 
amvac is currently looking at utilizing this system for other crops where the safety features of the system would provide an important benefit 
in july  amvac acquired from syngenta all us environmental protection agency epa end use product registrations and data support as well as a license to the ambush wp trademark wettable powder formulation in the united states 
syngenta continues to own the rights and assets of the liquid formulation ambush ec in the united states

bayer markets a product under its trademark def which is similar to folex  and continues to sell def following its acquisition of aventis 
seasonality the agricultural chemical industry in general is cyclical in nature 
the demand for amvac s products tends to be slightly seasonal 
seasonal usage  however  does not necessarily follow calendar dates  but more closely follows varying growing seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
backlog amvac does not believe that backlog is a significant factor in its business 
amvac primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders  although it has entered into requirements contracts with certain customers 
customers crop production services  inc formerly united agri products  western farm services and crop production services  tenkoz and windfield solution llc formerly agriliance accounted for  and  respectively of the company s sales in   and  respectively of the company s sales in in  crop production services  inc  windfield solution llc and helena chemical company accounted for  and respectively of the company s sales 
competition amvac faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers in its marketplaces 
competition in amvac s marketplace is based primarily on efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of such competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries amvac 
amvac s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and expand its product lines and customer base 
amvac competes principally on the basis of the quality of its products  its price and the technical service and support given to its customers 
the inability of amvac to effectively compete in several of amvac s principal products would have a material adverse effect on amvac s results of operations 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
amvac has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets which are no longer of strong focus to larger companies 
these markets are small by nature  require significant and intensive management input  ongoing product research  and are near product maturity 
these types of markets tend not to attract larger chemical companies due to the smaller volume demand  and larger chemical companies have been divesting themselves of products that fall into such niches as is evidenced by amvac s successful acquisitions of certain product lines 
intellectual property amvac s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets and  to a lesser extent  by patents 
further  amvac s trademarks bring value to its products in both domestic and foreign markets 
although amvac considers that  in the aggregate  its trademarks  licenses  and patents constitute a valuable asset  it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single trademark  license  or patent 
epa registrations amvac s products also receive protection afforded by the effect of the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra legislation that makes it unlawful to sell any pesticide in the united states unless such pesticide has first been registered by the environmental protection agency epa as well as under similar state laws 
substantially all of amvac s products are subject to epa registration and re registration requirements and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
this registration by epa is based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when it is used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of amvac s products are used require a registration by that specific state before it can be marketed or used in that state 
state registrations are renewed annually  as appropriate 
the epa and state agencies have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by amvac 
amvac  on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  has furnished  and is currently furnishing  certain required data relative to specific products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
amvac expensed   and  during  and respectively  related to gathering this information 
because scientific analyses are constantly improving  it cannot be determined with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by the regulatory authorities 
additionally  while fifra good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum practices and procedures which must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data related to these tests submitted to the epa  there can be no assurance the epa will not request certain tests studies be repeated 
amvac expenses these costs on an as incurred basis 
see also part ii  item of this annual report for discussions pertaining to research and development expenses 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries raw materials amvac utilizes numerous firms as well as internal sources to supply the various raw materials and components used by amvac in manufacturing its products 
many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources 
in those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic  amvac seeks to secure its supply by either long term arrangements or advance purchases from its suppliers 
amvac believes that it is considered to be a valued customer to such sole source suppliers 
recent increases in energy costs are expected to have an adverse impact on the company  although the ultimate impact cannot be measured at this time 
environmental during  amvac continued activities to address environmental issues associated with its facility the facility in commerce  ca 
in march  the california environmental protection agency department of toxic substances control dtsc accepted the facility into its expedited remedial action program erap 
under this program  the facility must prepare and implement an environmental investigation plan 
depending on the findings of the investigation  the facility may also be required to develop and implement remedial measures to address any historical environmental impairment 
the environmental investigation and any remediation activities related to ten underground storage tanks at the facility  which had been closed in  will also be addressed by amvac under erap 
soil and groundwater characterization activities began in december in accordance with the site investigation plan that was approved by the dtsc 
additional activities were conducted from to with oversight provided by the dtsc 
risk assessment activities are planned over the next year under the oversight of the dtsc 
following such risk assessment activities  further investigation and or potential remediation activities may be initiated in or these investigation and potential remediation activities are required at all facilities that currently have  or in the past had  hazardous waste storage permits 
because amvac previously held a hazardous waste management permit  amvac is subject to these requirements 
at this stage  the extent of further investigation and potential remediation activities is uncertain 
further  it is uncertain whether the cost associated with such investigation and potential remediation activities will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in  amvac began the process to close its hazardous waste permit at the facility  which had allowed amvac to store hazardous waste longer than days 
although this practice was discontinued several years prior  federal regulations require amvac to formally close out the permit 
formal regulatory closure actions began in and were completed in  as evidenced by dtsc s october  acknowledgement of amvac s closure certification report 
amvac is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at the commerce  ca  marsing  id  hannibal  mo and axis  al facilities 
amvac continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies 
the us epa and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on amvac s operations 
amvac expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment 
wherever feasible  amvac recovers raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries the company is committed to a long term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment  as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns 
federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations 
as part of its continuing environmental program  except as disclosed in part i  item  legal proceedings  of this annual report  the company has been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on its business 
employees as of february   the company employed approximately employees 
amvac  on an ongoing basis  due to the seasonality of its business  uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products 
the company believes it is cost beneficial to employ temporary contract personnel 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees

risk factors the company s business may be adversely affected by cyclical and seasonal effects 
the chemical industry in general is cyclical and demands for its products tend to be slightly seasonal 
seasonal usage follows varying agricultural seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
weather patterns can have an impact on the company s operations 
the end user of some of its products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season  which may result in a reduction of the use of some products and therefore may reduce our revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will adequately address any adverse seasonal effects 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries the company faces competition in certain markets from manufacturers of genetically modified seeds 
the company faces competition from larger chemical companies that market genetically modified gmo seeds in certain of the crop protection sectors in which the company competes  particularly that of corn 
to the extent that growers in these markets embrace the use of gmo seeds  such growers may reduce their use of pesticides sold by the company 
there is no guarantee that the company will maintain its market share or pricing levels in sectors that are subject to competition from gmo seed marketers 
the company s key customers typically carry competing product lines and may be influenced by the company s larger competitors 
a significant portion of the company s products are sold to national distributors who also carry product lines of competitors that are much larger than the company 
typically  revenues from the sales of these competing product lines and related program incentives constitute a greater part of our distributors income than do revenues from sales and program incentives arising from the company s product lines 
further  these distributors are often under pressure to market competing product lines in favor of the company s 
in light of these facts  there is no assurance that such customers will market or continue to market our products aggressively or successfully or that the company will be able to influence such customers to purchase our products in favor of those of our competitors 
to the extent that capacity utilization is not fully realized at its manufacturing facilities  the company may experience lower profitability 
the company has pursued a business strategy of acquiring manufacturing facilities at a steep discount to their replacement value 
these acquisitions have enabled the company to be more independent of overseas manufacturers than some of our competitors 
while the company endeavors continuously to maximize utilization of these several facilities  our success in these endeavors is dependent upon many factors beyond our control  including fluctuating market conditions  product life cycles  weather conditions  availability of raw materials and regulatory constraints  among other things 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maximize its utilization of capacity at its manufacturing facilities 
to the extent that the company experiences excess manufacturing capacity  it may experience lower profitability 
reduced availability and higher prices of raw materials may reduce the company s profitability and could threaten the viability of some of its products 
in the recent past  there has been a material reduction in the number of suppliers of certain important raw materials used by the company in many of its products 
certain of these raw materials are available solely from sources overseas or from single sources domestically 
the price of these raw materials has increased sharply over the past year and continues to increase 
demand for these materials  however  appears to continue unabated within this industry 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to source some or all of these materials indefinitely or that it will be able to do so at a level of cost that will enable it to maintain its profit margin on its products 
foreign currency and interest rate risk and the use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company engages in global business transactions 
where possible  the company does business in its functional currency 
however  there are certain situations in which the company is unable to transact in its functional currency and engages in agreements primarily material purchase contracts  that require settlement in a different currency 
the company has entered into derivatives as cash flow hedges in order to protect its trading 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries performance from the exposure of movements in exchange rate over time 
the company sets up foreign currency forward cover contracts via the company s banker  bank of the west 
furthermore  the company has in place two fixed interest rate swaps with the objective of reducing the company s exposure to movements in the libor rate over time 
the hedges are evaluated at the end of each quarter and the effective portions of gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income  while the ineffective portions are recorded in current earnings 
quarterly variability in factors affecting the company s business may mean that an individual quarter s result may not provide a realistic picture of the company s overall performance 
due to elements inherent to the company s business  such as differing and unpredictable weather patterns  crop growing cycles  changes in sales mix  ordering patterns that may vary in timing  and promotional programs  measuring the company s performance on a quarterly basis  gross profit margins on a quarterly basis may vary significantly even when such comparisons are favorable  is not as meaningful an indicator as full year comparisons 
the primary reason is that the use cycles do not necessarily coincide with financial reporting cycles 
the company s cost structure  the combination of variable revenue streams  and the changing product mixes  result in varying quarterly levels of profitability 
the potential impact on the company s operations during an economic downturn 
an economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products in a timely manner  or to maintain operations  and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
such volatility and disruption could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain financing for both working capital needs and acquisitions 
dependence on the company s banking relationship 
the company is dependent on its banking relationship at all times and particularly in these current volatile times 
the company s main bank is bank of the west  a wholly owned subsidiary of the french bank  bnp paribas 
bank of the west has been the company s bank for more than years 
bank of the west is the syndication manager for the company s loans and acts as the counterparty on the company s derivative transactions 
the company reviews the creditworthiness of its banks on a quarterly basis via both credit agencies and face to face meetings with senior management of the banks 
management believes that the company has an excellent working relationship with bank of the west and the other financial institutions in the company s banking syndicate 
the industry in which the company does business is extremely competitive and its business may suffer if the company is unable to compete effectively 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
the company faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers  marketers and distributors participating in its marketplace 
competition in the marketplace is based primarily on efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources 
the company s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products  and to expand its product lines and customer base 
the company competes principally on the basis of the quality of its products  and the technical service and support given to its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will compete successfully with existing competitors or with any new competitors 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries the distribution and sale of the company s products are subject to prior governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation 
the company s products are subject to laws administered by federal  state and foreign governments  including regulations requiring registration  approval and labeling of its products 
the labeling requirements restrict the use of and type of application for our products 
more stringent restrictions could make our products less desirable  which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
substantially all of the company s products are subject to the epa registration and re registration requirements  and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
such registration requirements are based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of the company s products are used also require registration before they can be marketed or used in that state 
governmental regulatory authorities have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on the company s products 
the company  on its behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  have and are currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement has significantly increased the company s operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
the company expects such increases to continue in the future 
because scientific analyses are constantly improving  it cannot be determined with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by regulatory authorities 
responding to such requirements may cause delays in the sales of our products that would adversely affect our profitability 
while fifra good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum practices and procedures that must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of the data related to these tests that are submitted to the us epa 
there can be no assurance the epa will not request certain tests or studies be repeated 
in addition  more stringent legislation or requirements may be imposed in the future 
the company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to develop additional applications for its products  and to expand its product lines and customer base 
the company has grown primarily by a strategy of acquiring mature product lines from larger competitors and expanding sales of these products based on new applications and new users 
the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to develop additional applications for its products  and to expand its product lines and customer base in a highly competitive market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in adequately addressing these development needs on a timely basis or that  if these developments are addressed  the company will be successful in the marketplace 
in addition  there can be no assurance that products or technologies eg  genetic engineering developed by others will not render the company s products noncompetitive or obsolete  which would have a material adverse effect on its financial and operating results 
many of the mature product lines the company has acquired from larger competitors were divested as a result of mergers involving such large competitors 
if the company is unable to successfully position itself in smaller niche markets  its business may be materially adversely affected 
the company has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets that have been or are being abandoned by larger chemical companies 
these types of markets tend not to attract larger chemical companies due to the smaller volume demand 
as a result  larger chemical companies have been divesting themselves of products that fall into such smaller niche markets 
these smaller niche markets require significant and intensive management input and ongoing product research and are near product maturity 
there can be no assurance that 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries the company will be successful in these smaller niche markets or  if it is successful in one or more niche markets  that it will continue to be successful in such niche markets 
the manufacturing of the company s products is subject to governmental regulations 
the company currently operates three manufacturing facilities in los angeles  california  axis  alabama  and marsing  idaho and owns and has manufacturing services provided in a fourth facility in hannibal  missouri the facilities 
the facilities operate under the terms and conditions imposed by required licenses and permits by state and local authorities 
the manufacturing of key ingredients for the company s products occurs at the facilities 
an inability to renew or maintain a license or permit or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits could impede the company s access to key ingredients and increase the cost of production  which  in turn  would materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide its products in a timely and affordable manner 
the company may be subject to environmental liabilities 
the company  its facilities  and its products are subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety 
the company continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies 
the us epa and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials into the environment and to comply with governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment 
federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations  and could  among other things  impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from release of pesticides and other agents into the environment

item legal proceedings a 
dbcp cases amvac and or the company have been named or otherwise implicated in a number of lawsuits concerning injuries allegedly arising from either contamination of water supplies or personal exposure to  dibromo chloropropane dbcp 
a summary of these actions follows i 
hawaii matters board of water supply v 
shell oil co 
et al 
amvac and the company were served with complaints in february the actions were filed in the circuit court of the second circuit  state of hawaii entitled board of water supply of the county of maui v 
shell oil co  et 
al 
the suit named as defendants the company  amvac  shell oil company  the dow chemical company  occidental chemical company  occidental petroleum corporation  occidental chemical corporation  and brewer environmental industry  inc maui pineapple company was joined as a cross defendant 
the complaint alleged that between two and four of the board s wells had been contaminated with dbcp in excess of the maximum contaminant level mcl 
in addition  the board of water supply contended that future wells may exceed the mcl level and would need remediation 
on august   a global settlement was reached  which included the remediation of the existing contaminated wells in addition to the installation of filtration devices on other wells for the next forty years on the island of maui 
the cash settlement was three million dollars  of which amvac s and the company s portion was five hundred thousand dollars 
the settlement agreement obligates the defendants to pay for the installation of filtration devices on other wells that become contaminated later and for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the filtration devices for up to forty years 
the annual costs of operation and maintenance per well is estimated to be approximately sixty nine thousand dollars  to be adjusted annually by the consumer price index 
the obligations of the defendants under this agreement are secured by a twenty million dollar letter of credit obtained 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries by dow chemical 
in connection with the settlement  in october  amvac paid for a share of a permanent filtration system in the amount of  in april  amvac paid  for its share of operations and maintenance expenses for patrickson  et

v 
dole food co  et 
al in october  amvac was served with a complaint s in which it was named as a defendant  filed in the circuit court  first circuit  state of hawaii and in the circuit court of the second circuit  state of hawaii two identical suits entitled patrickson  et

v 
dole food co  et 
al patrickson case alleging damages sustained from injuries caused by plaintiffs exposure to dbcp while applying the product in their native countries 
other named defendants are dole food co  dole fresh fruit  dole fresh fruit international  pineapple growers association of hawaii  shell oil company  dow chemical company  occidental chemical corporation  standard fruit company  standard fruit steamship  standard fruit company de costa rica  standard fruit company de honduras  chiquita brands  chiquita brands international  martrop trading corporation  and del monte fresh produce 
american vanguard corporation has not been sued in these actions 
the ten named plaintiffs are citizens of four countries guatemala  costa rica  panama  and ecuador 
punitive damages are sought against each defendant 
the plaintiffs were banana workers and allege that they were exposed to dbcp in applying the product in their native countries 
the case was also filed as a class action on behalf of other workers so exposed in these four countries 
the plaintiffs allege sterility and other injuries 
the suits were removed to federal court and for the last several years  the focus of the case has been on procedural issues  including the dismissal of the case based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens 
this doctrine would require the plaintiffs to pursue their claims in their native countries 
on april   the united states supreme court issued a decision on the procedural posture of the case  holding there was no jurisdiction in federal court and remanded the case to state court 
on september   the state court ordered the transfer of venue from maui county to oahu 
the court held a status conference on april  and tentatively set the case for trial for february  the plaintiffs filed a preliminary motion for class certification  which was denied by the court on june  the plaintiffs attorney has advised that he wants to add several thousand other individuals as plaintiffs here or in some other action  but has not attempted to do so thus far 
discovery has just begun and two of the plaintiffs have stated that they no longer wish to be parties 
the court rescheduled the trial to commence on january  it is unknown whether any of the plaintiffs were exposed to amvac brand dbcp  what are the actual injuries  or what statute of limitation defenses may apply 
amvac intends to contest the cases vigorously 
defendants intend to schedule depositions of the plaintiffs in the near future 
at this stage  the company believes that  while possible  a loss is neither probable  nor reasonably estimable and  accordingly  it has not accrued a loss contingency therefor 
further  the plaintiffs attorneys reported that the ten plaintiffs filed suit in their home countries in  based on the prior order of forum non conveniens  alleging damages in excess of two million united states dollars  per plaintiff 
the suit in guatemala was served on amvac in march  but no defendant has been required to answer 
suits in the other countries have not been served 
amvac has engaged local attorneys in the countries to defend these foreign suits 
adams v 
dole food co

plaintiff mark adams alleges he was exposed to dbcp in and while working on dole s plantation on oahu 
plaintiff nelson ng alleges he was exposed 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries between and while working in lanai city  lanai 
amvac answered the complaint on or about december  while no discovery has taken place  amvac denies that any of its product could have been used at the times and locations alleged by these plaintiffs 
at this stage  the company believes that  while remotely possible  a loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and  accordingly  it has not accrued loss contingency therefor 
ii 
mississippi matters in may  amvac was served with five complaints in which it is named as a defendant 
these complaints were filed by the same attorneys representing the patrickson plaintiffs in hawaii 
the complaints are brought by plaintiffs edgar arroyo gonzalez  eulogio garzon larreategui  valentinvaldez  amilcar belteton rivera  and carlos nicanor espinola e against one or more of the following named defendants coahoma chemical co 
inc  shell oil company  dow chemical co  occidental chemical co  standard fruit co  standard fruit and steamship co  dole food co  inc  dole fresh fruit co  chiquita brands  inc  chiquita brands international  inc 
and del monte fresh produce  na the cases were filed in the circuit court of harrison county  first judicial district of mississippi 
each case alleged damages sustained from injuries caused by plaintiffs who are former banana workers and citizens of a central american country exposure to dbcp while applying the product in their native countries 
these cases were removed to us district court for the southern district of mississippi  southern division 
the federal court granted defense motions to dismiss in each case pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens 
on january   the court issued an unpublished decision  finding that there was jurisdiction in federal court  but remanded just one case espinola back to the trial court based on a stipulation which limited the plaintiff s recovery to fifty thousand dollars 
no activity has taken place on this matter since without discovery  it is unknown whether this plaintiff was exposed to the company s product or what defenses may apply 
at this stage  the company believes that  while possible  a loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and  accordingly  it has not accrued a loss contingency therefor 
iii 
louisiana matters in november  amvac chemical corporation was served with three complaints filed in the th judicial district court for the parish of st 
charles  state of louisiana entitled pedro rodrigues et 
al v 
amvac chemical corporation et 
al  andres puerto  et 
al v 
amvac chemical corporation  et 
al and eduardo soriano  et al v 
amvac chemical corporation et 
al 
other named defendants are dow chemical company  occidental chemical corporation  shell oil company  standard fruit  dole food  chiquita brands  tela railroad company  compania palma tica  and del monte fresh produce 
these suits were filed in  but they were not served until november following a dismissal of most of the plaintiffs from the action in light of the fact that they had previously settled their claims in other actions  the complaints  with soriano as the lead case  allege personal injuries to about persons from ecuador  from costa rica  and from guatemala from alleged exposure to dbcp punitive damages are also sought 
with the united states supreme court holding there was no federal court jurisdiction in the patrickson case  the federal court judge remanded the cases to louisiana state court in june in state court  the three cases were assigned to two different judges 
on november   the state court separated the cases handled by attorney scott hendler from the cases being pursed only against the growers handled by different counsel 
subsequently  the cases against the growers were settled and all those actions were dismissed 
the cases handled by mr 
hendler were supposed to be placed in a new action  which was not done 
after a hearing on january   the court ruled on february  that these plaintiffs could still proceed in the existing cases rather than in a new pleading 
as in many of the other banana worker s cases  no discovery has taken place on the individual claims of the plaintiffs 
thus  it is unknown as to how many of the plaintiffs claim exposure to amvac s product  what are the actual injuries  and whether their claims are barred by applicable statutes of limitation 
amvac intends to 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries vigorously contest these cases 
at this stage  the company believes that  while possible  a loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and  accordingly  it has not accrued a loss contingency therefor 
iv 
nicaragua matters tellez et al v 
dole food company  inc et al on march   plaintiffs  all residents of nicaragua  filed suit in state court in los angeles county  california  claiming personal injuries from alleged exposure to dbcp while working on banana plantations in their home country 
the named defendants are dole food company  inc  dole fresh fruit company  standard fruit company  standard fruit and steamship company  dow chemical company  and amvac chemical corporation 
punitive damages were also sought against all defendants 
the plaintiffs  all field workers  claim personal injuries for complete sterility azoospermia or in one case  severely reduced sperm count 
they claim exposure from working on banana plantations in nicaragua from dermal contact with dbcp and inhalation of vapors 
the plaintiffs also claimed exposure to dbcp in groundwater that they ingested  but testing of wells in october did not reveal the presence of any dbcp contamination and this claim of exposure through groundwater was dropped 
in march  amvac settled with the remaining plaintiffs for a total of  without any admission of liability 
this settlement was approved by the court on april  the case proceeded to a jury trial against the dole food and dow chemical defendants in july for plaintiffs as one was transferred to the mejia case 
on november   the jury found for the defendants on the claims of six of the plaintiffs and found for the plaintiffs on the other six for a total award of approximately million 
for five of the six plaintiffs  the jury allocated of the liability to dole on fraudulent concealment and strict liability causes of action and to dow and on the other plaintiff on strict products liability 
in further deliberations  the same jury awarded  in punitive damages to each of five plaintiffs as against the dole entities for fraudulent concealment for a total of an additional million 
on march   the trial court granted dole s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to punitive damages thereby reversing the award of punitive damages of million against dole 
in reaching its decision  the court found that any award of punitive damages as against dole would be violative of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment as the claimed injuries to plaintiffs and dole s acts occurred outside of california 
the court also reversed the finding of strict products liability against dole 
both sides have filed appeals 
as this case impacts the other dbcp suits  the company is monitoring these developments 
this case  like the other pending banana workers suits  demonstrates the difficult issues of law and fact to all parties and the potential of large verdicts  at least in cases involving claims of complete sterility azoospermia that defendants cannot explain 
in all of these banana worker cases  there is no guarantee that the company will be able to avoid an adverse judgment or that the size of any such judgment will not have an adverse effect upon the company s financial performance 
if plaintiffs are ultimately successful in this action  it is likely that other banana workers from nicaragua will file suit in california 
rodolfo mejia et al v 
dole food company  inc et al on september   the attorneys who also represent plaintiffs in tellez et al v 
dole food company et al filed an action on behalf of nicaraguan plaintiffs in the los angeles county superior court against dole food company  inc  dole fresh fruit company  standard fruit company  standard fruit and steamship company  the dow chemical company  and amvac chemical corporation 
the complaint alleges that the plaintiffs worked at various banana farms in nicaragua and were exposed to dbcp from to  suffering 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries irreversible sterility or infertility 
the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against each defendant 
the suit has been assigned to the same judge for case management and trial as in the tellez matter 
these plaintiffs allege that they were all applicators of the product at the banana farms 
the plaintiffs also allege exposure to dbcp from contaminated groundwater 
the court has limited discovery to plaintiffs and any others beyond that number must be transferred to another case 
this case will be set for trial for some time in however  a preliminary trial has also been set for september  to determine whether the plaintiffs have committed fraud in filing their claims 
ten of the plaintiffs remain in the case as the others have been dismissed 
at this stage  the company believes that a loss is not probable and therefore has not accrued a loss contingency therefor  however  based upon the disposition of the tellez matter  the company believes that a loss and or costs of between k and k is reasonably possible 
at a status conference on february   the court ordered that the parties in this case and all the other dbcp cases filed in los angeles must engage in global mediation sessions that are to include all cases 
rivera et al v 
dole food company  inc et al on october   the attorneys who also represent plaintiffs in tellez et al v 
dole food company et al filed an action on behalf of four nicaraguan plaintiffs in the los angeles county superior court against dole food company  inc  dole fresh fruit company  standard fruit company  standard fruit and steamship company  the dow chemical company  and amvac chemical corporation 
the complaint alleges that the four plaintiffs worked at various banana farms in nicaragua and were exposed to dbcp from to  suffering irreversible sterility or infertility 
the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against each defendant 
the suit has been assigned to the same judge for case management and trial as in the tellez and the mejia matters 
the complaint was amended on november  to include a total of six plaintiffs 
amvac answered this first amended complaint on january  as explained above  these six workers were then added to the mejia suit on january  presently  there is just one plaintiff named in the rivera case  which remains stayed pending resolution of the mejia action 
with respect to rivera  the company believes that  while possible  a loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and  accordingly  it has not accrued a loss contingency therefor 
suits filed in nicaragua the los angeles attorneys representing these workers in california have recently stated that they have as many as  clients in nicaragua 
in prior descriptions of pending litigation and other matters  several suits filed in nicaragua in january on behalf of banana workers claiming exposure to dbcp were mentioned 
it was reported that amvac had been named in these suits  but was not served with the complaints 
in may  two suits filed in nicaragua in were received that name amvac  the dow chemical company  dole food co  dole fresh fruit  and standard fruit company 
the two suits for personal injuries for sterility and reduced sperm counts have been filed on behalf of a total of banana workers flavio apolinar castillo et al 
v 
amvac chemical corporation et al  no 
and luis cristobal martinez suazo et al 
v 
amvac chemical corporation et al  no 
in december  amvac received six additional  similar lawsuits filed on behalf of a total of plaintiffs 
these plaintiffs each claim million in special and general damages and million in punitive damages 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries amvac has retained an attorney in nicaragua and understands that the receipt of these eight suits constitutes first notice and an invitation to attend mediation 
all but one of these suits is based on nicaraguan public law issued in october that is directed solely at dbcp and requires the posting of a  bond which plaintiffs in these cases have waived  sets forth a lessened standard of proof to show that the claimed injuries are due to dbcp  and establishes an unreasonable amount of minimum compensation for injuries 
this law also provides that there is no statute of limitations 
on january   amvac was served with the flavio apolinar castillo and luis cristobal martinez suazo suits listed above 
in march  counsel in nicaragua filed objections to jurisdiction over amvac in these two cases 
the court finally ruled on all the defendants objections on march  by denying each objection to jurisdiction 
a review of court filings in chinandega  nicaragua  by local counsel has found suits filed pursuant to public law that name amvac and include approximately  plaintiffs 
however  only the two castillo and suazo cases have been served on amvac 
each of these plaintiffs claims million in special and general damages and million in punitive damages 
it is anticipated that the plaintiffs attorneys will continue to file additional actions on a monthly basis in nicaragua 
in an earlier round of suits brought in nicaragua against dow  shell  and standard fruit only  the nicaragua court issued judgments for million in december based on claims of banana workers  despite defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and the unconstitutionality of public law it has been reported that in  the united states district court in los angeles refused to enforce these judgments on the basis that the judgments did not properly name the defendants 
the us district court did not reach the issue of due process under public law an appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit is pending 
amvac contends that the nicaragua courts do not have jurisdiction over it and that public law violates international due process of law 
amvac intends to contest personal jurisdiction and demand under law that the claims be litigated in the united states 
thus far  it appears that the nicaraguan courts have denied all requests of other defendants under law that allow the defendants the option of consenting to jurisdiction in the united states 
it is not presently known as to how many of these plaintiffs actually claim exposure to dbcp at the time amvac s product was allegedly used nor is there any verification of the claimed injuries 
based on the precedent of the earlier suits in nicaragua  it would appear likely that the nicaragua courts will  over the defendants objections  enter multi million dollar judgments for the plaintiffs and against all defendants in these cases 
one such judgment was entered in august for million for plaintiffs against dole food and other entities 
it has also been reported that on december   the nicaraguan court rendered a judgment for million against dow  shell  occidental  and standard fruit for some plaintiffs 
presently pending before the us district court in miami  florida  is an enforcement action against dole and dow for the million judgment 
with respect to the nicaraguan cases  the company believes that  while possible  a loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and  accordingly  it has not accrued loss contingency therefor 
v 
ivory coast cases on october   amvac was served with seven suits filed in the los angeles county superior court and one suit in the united states district court in los angeles that include a total of residents of the ivory coast as plaintiffs 
each plaintiff claims bodily injuries from exposure to dbcp while residing or working on banana or pineapple plantations in that country from the s to the present 
the suits name amvac  dow chemical  shell oil company  and dole food as defendants 
all these suits also seek punitive damages  and the 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries action filed in federal court alleges a claim under the alien tort claims act  alleging that the sale and use of dbcp amounted to genocide in the ivory coast 
amvac did not sell any dbcp into the ivory coast at any time and intends to defend these cases vigorously 
discovery has not yet begun in these cases 
on november   dow and shell removed the seven state court cases to federal court  alleging that the naming of amvac and the dole entities amounted to a fraudulent joinder of those defendants by plaintiffs to defeat federal jurisdiction 
however  the federal court remanded all of those cases on its own motion back to state court 
these state cases were reassigned to the same complex case management judge as in the tellez and mejia suits in may limited discovery has been permitted to focus on preliminary issues as to which dbcp product was used in the ivory coast and which defendants  if any  belong in these cases 
the plaintiffs attorney is unwilling to dismiss any defendant at this time 
a further status conference is scheduled for april  on december  amvac answered the alien tort claims act case in federal court 
a defense motion for judgment on the pleadings in the case was granted on march   whereby the court dismissed the genocide and unlawful distribution of pesticide claims with prejudice  and dismissed the remaining claims with leave to amend 
the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in april regarding only the claims for relief for crimes against humanity and racial discrimination and omitting the claims that the court had dismissed 
defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss that was heard on may  and was granted after being taken under submission 
the plaintiffs appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeal  which denied plaintiffs appeal on september  on october   the plaintiffs served a petition for rehearing in the ninth circuit before the entire panel of judges  which was also denied 
the company believes that  while remotely possible  a loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and  accordingly  it has not accrued a loss contingency therefor

other matters on july   amvac s registered agent was served with a putative class action complaint entitled latrice mclendon  et al 
v 
philip service corporation etc 
et al including amvac  which was filed in the superior state court of fulton county  state of georgia no 
cn and subsequently removed to the united states district court for the northern district of georgia no 
cv cap  in which a class of georgia plaintiffs seek damages  including punitive damages  in an unspecified amount for personal injuries and diminution in property value allegedly arising from the airborne release of propyl mercaptan and ethoprop from a waste treatment facility operated by psc recovery services psc in fairburn  georgia 
plaintiffs  residents living in the vicinity of the psc plant  allege trespass  nuisance and negligence on behalf of defendants in handling  storing and treating waste which was generated by amvac s axis  alabama facility 
after having completed class certification discovery  and prior to a ruling from the court on certification of the class  the parties engaged in mediation on september  before a neutral mediator 
working in conjunction with their insurance carriers at the mediation  defendants amvac and psc have agreed to settle the matter with a settlement class of approximately  households for payment of cash consideration of million  which amount shall be divided evenly between co defendants and paid by their respective insurance carriers 
the cost of claims administration  class notice  plaintiffs attorneys fees  and class relief will be paid out of the million settlement fund 
on september   the court entered an order giving its preliminary approval of the class settlement 
the class settlement notice was mailed to class members the last week of october class members had until january  either i to submit the claim form required for a monetary payment from the 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries settlement fund  or ii either to object to the settlement  or seek to be excluded from the settlement 
as of this date  approximately class members have returned claim forms  the parties are reviewing forms for completeness and validity 
the court will consider final approval of the class settlement at a hearing currently scheduled for april   and we anticipate the court will enter the final order approving the settlement on or shortly after that date 
payments to class members who complete a valid claim form will be made days after final approval of the settlement 
as currently proposed  the settlement would not have an adverse effect upon the company s financial performance 
further  in light of the fact that the settlement is being paid through insurance  the company does not believe that a loss to the company is probable and has not set up a loss contingency therefor 
however  the settlement is not yet final  members of the settlement class remain free to opt out of the settlement and to preserve their individual rights  and it is not anticipated that the settlement will include mutual releases between co defendants 
in addition  each co defendant s insurance carrier has reserved all rights under applicable insurance policies  including rights to subrogation and contribution

ev j  was filed in the state court of fulton county  state of georgia 
plaintiffs assert personal injury including kidney failure and property damage claims based on the same alleged airborne chemical release from the same psc facility at issue in the mclendon litigation 
plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts and assert causes of action for negligence  negligence per se  trespass  and nuisance 
amvac believes that the action is without merit and intends to defend it vigorously 
on october   the court denied amvac s motion for dismissal of the trespass and nuisance claims which motion had been granted by the court in the mclendon with substantially similar facts 
at this point the company believes that  while possible  a loss in this matter is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  and  accordingly  it has not accrued a loss contingency therefor

this included the newly acquired orthene product line 
furthermore  we saw high demand for our mosquito adulticide product  dibrom 
this was a direct result of the intense hurricane season in the southeast  and we are pleased to report that our sales performance was improved by first time orders from texas 
our performance was also positively impacted by strong sales of our soil fumigant product line 
our pcnb product line  which has been a core product for the company throughout our history and has been augmented in the last months with the purchase of the chemtura terraclor and turfside brands  performed better than expected

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries these significant improvements were partially offset by a number of factors 
we experienced lower demand for our cotton insecticide bidrin  driven by reduced cotton acres under cultivation in the usa 
our granular corn soil insecticide products underperformed compared to as a result of very adverse weather conditions which persisted during the midwest planting season 
furthermore  sales of our leading corn herbicide product impact have been lower in as some key distributors managed inventory levels through the season

we have worked hard to manage this exposure with focused inventory purchasing decisions and entering into favorable long term purchase commitments 
in addition  we have instituted some selective product line selling price increases 
during the latter part of we acquired our manufacturing facility in hannibal  mo  and then in the early part of  we acquired our facility in marsing  id 
these facilities previously provided product for the company 
also  during we have carried out some third party tolling activities 
these activities are targeted at improving overall manufacturing asset utilization 
the products identified for tolling contracts are based on chemistries that fit well with our manufacturing capabilities and equipment

weather patterns can have an impact on the company s operations 
weather conditions influence pest population by impacting gestation cycles for particular pests and the effectiveness of some of the company s products  among other factors 
the end user of some of the company s products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season which may result in a reduction of the use of some of the company s products 
during  weather patterns had significant impact as noted above

the primary reason is that the use cycles do not necessarily coincide with financial reporting cycles 
because of the company s cost structure  the combination of variable revenue streams  and the changing product mixes  results in varying quarterly levels of profitability 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we believe that our cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next months 
although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent of significant growth in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all

foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to sell products at agreed upon prices denominated in us dollars 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future 
should adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations occur in geographies where the company sells exports its products  management is not certain such fluctuations will or will not materially impact the company s operating results 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years 
however  management has witnessed a trend of rising costs with respect to raw materials sourced in other countries 
whether this trend arises from inflation or other factors is uncertain 
critical accounting policies certain of the company s policies require the application of judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  commonly accepted industry practices and other assumptions that the company 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s critical accounting polices and estimates include revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue from sales is recognized at the time title and the risks of ownership pass 
this is when the customer has made the fixed commitment to purchase the goods  the products are shipped per the customer s instructions  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company has in place procedures to ensure that revenue is recognized when earned 
the procedures are subject to management s review and from time to time certain sales are excluded until it is clear that the title has passed and there is no further recourse to the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusted for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
accrued program costs the company has adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
in accordance with eitf  the company classifies certain payments to its customers as a reduction of sales revenues 
other payments are operating expenses 
the company describes these costs overall as programs 
programs are a critical part of doing business in the agricultural chemicals business place 
essentially they are volume or other key performance indicator kpi driven payments made to distributors or retailers at the end of a growing season 
each quarter management applies experience and market place knowledge to estimate the current liability 
long lived asset the carrying value of long lived assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
management considers the carrying value of long lived assets to be reasonable 
generally  the fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
property  plant and equipment and depreciation property  plant and equipment includes the cost of land  buildings  machinery and equipment  office furniture and fixtures  automobiles  construction projects and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment 
interest costs related to significant construction projects are capitalized at the company s weighted average cost of capital 
expenditures for maintenance and minor repairs are expensed as incurred 
when property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts and the gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in earnings 
all plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method  utilizing the estimated useful property lives 
building lives range from to years  machinery and equipment lives range from to years  office furniture and fixture lives range from to years  automobile lives range from to years  construction projects and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment lives range from to years when placed in service 
the agricultural chemicals business involves complex manufacturing processes that drive high capital cost plant 
foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  where the local currency is the functional currency  have been translated at period end exchange rates and profit and loss accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly exchange rates 
adjustments resulting from translation have been recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as cumulative translation adjustments in other comprehensive income loss 
the effect of foreign currency exchange gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries currencies other than the entity s functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency using the end of the period exchange rates 
the effects of remeasurement related to foreign currency transactions are included in current profit and loss accounts 
derivative financial instruments and hedge activities in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company recognizes all derivative instruments as either other assets or other liabilities at fair or market value on the balance sheet 
in accordance with the hierarchy contained in sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  the company calculated fair value using observable inputs other than level quoted prices level 
the company has put in place as a hedge against the foreign currency exposure of a foreign currency denominated forecast purchase transaction 
the company re evaluates the effectiveness of its derivative instruments using the dollar offset ratio and the cumulative dollar offset method for ineffectiveness 
these re evaluations are performed at the end of each quarter 
the company also has in place two interest rate swap contracts that are accounted for under sfas the company qualifies for the short cut method for these swaps and performs quarterly re evaluations to determine continued qualification for this method 
any gains or losses on derivative instruments that are deemed effective are taken as an adjustment to other comprehensive income loss 
if any contracts are deemed ineffective  then gains and losses in those contracts are taken as an adjustment to operating income

goodwill and other intangible assets the primary identifiable intangible assets of the company relate to product rights associated with its product acquisitions 
the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those with indefinite lives are not amortized 
the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset to the company is based upon a number of factors including the effects of demand  competition  and expected changes in the marketability of the company s products 
the company re evaluates whether these intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans and future cash flows 
identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate elements of property 
the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consisting of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss  if any  is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset s being tested for impairment as well as selecting a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
when determining future cash flow estimates  the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company  in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions  product pricing and necessary capital expenditures 
the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for long lived assets  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
