item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report  all amounts related to united states dollars and foreign currency and to the number of shares of nordson corporation common shares  except for per share earnings and dividend amounts  are expressed in thousands 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
on a regular basis  critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements  such as those including installation or other services  are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element 
if the installation or other services are inconsequential to the functionality of the delivered product  the entire amount of revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of the criteria noted above 
inconsequential installation or other services are those that can generally be completed in a short period of time  at insignificant cost  and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to us 
if installation or other services are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  revenues attributable to these obligations are deferred until completed 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
revenues deferred in fiscal years  and were not material 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level  or more often if indications of impairment exist 
the number of reporting units tested for goodwill impairment increased in fiscal year because we tested one level below one of our three operating segments as a result of the impact of the global economic downturn 
for fiscal year  our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment  the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 
based upon the results of our impairment testing  we recognized an impairment charge for a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill in the amount of  relating to six reporting units as follows dage  picodostec  yestech  march plasma systems  uv curing  and industrial coating systems  
table of contents the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
in the first step  performed in the fourth quarter of each year  we calculate a reporting unit s fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology and compare the result against the reporting unit s carrying value of net assets 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired 
in step one  the assumptions used for discounted cash flow  revenue growth  operating margin  and working capital turnover are based on general management s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends 
with respect to revenue growth assumptions in particular  we tempered our outlook for fiscal year and future years by looking at historical data since the last recession in and  measuring apparent recovery and rebound growth apart from growth experienced after the recovery  and noting order growth for sequential reporting periods during fiscal year terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital methodology wacc and growth rate 
for each reporting unit  sensitivity calculations vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of assurance that our expected assumptions are fair for detecting impairment 
discount rates were developed using a wacc methodology 
the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors 
the discount rates used ranged from percent to percent depending upon the reporting unit s size  end market volatility  and projection risk 
the calculated internal rate of return for the step one consolidated valuation was percent  which is reasonable when compared to a calculated wacc for total nordson of percent 
to test the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow valuations  we performed the control premium test  which compares the sum of the fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity 
the control premium was percent as of the test date of july  and percent as of our fiscal year end of october  the control premium declined during our fourth quarter due to an increase in market value of equity 
these comparisons indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable 
as a result of our step one testing  we determined that the second step of impairment testing was necessary 
in the second step  a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities is performed using the fair value calculated in step one 
the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the hypothetical fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied goodwill amount 
impairment is recorded if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is higher than its implied goodwill 
the charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment charge is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment charge is prohibited once the measurement of that charge is completed 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  including any unrecognized intangible assets 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
that assignment process is performed only for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  we cannot write up or write down a recognized asset or liability  nor can we recognize a previously unrecognized intangible asset as a result of that allocation process 
following our write down of goodwill  the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for remaining reporting units having no impairment 
based on the results shown in the table below  our conclusion is that no remaining impairment exists 
with respect to the efd reporting unit  a decline in fair value exceeding percent would be required for possible impairment 
potential events or circumstances resulting in a negative effect to the estimated fair value could range from a further downturn in global economies to a much slower recovery than assumed 
excess of wacc fv over cv goodwill adhesive dispensing asymtek efd 
table of contents at july   we had no indicators of impairment 
by october   all major stock markets had suffered sudden and significant declines 
for goodwill testing purposes  we modified downward our growth and profitability assumptions for what was believed to be a temporary downturn in the economy 
based on these revised assumptions  the excess of fair value over carrying value exceeded percent for the three operating segments tested adhesive dispensing systems  advanced technology systems  and industrial coating systems 
the global economic downturn was occurring early in our fiscal year  and we initiated steps to mitigate the loss of revenue on profitability  cash flows  and fair value of reporting units 
we implemented actions to reduce workforce and other costs and to optimize cash flows across reporting units 
our revenue outlook required time to estimate fairly 
insight from the volume of customer orders helped us see the bottom  monitor points of inflection  and see an upturn occurring in quarters three and four 
accordingly  our annual goodwill impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year had the benefit of additional insight to order trends  growth expectations  and effects of mitigating actions 
our quarterly assessments looked at the market value of equity  confirmed solvency  and projected positive liquidity  profitability  and improving order trends in the second half of the year 
in fiscal year  we tested one level below the operating segment level for advanced technology systems primarily because this segment included three acquisitions made in fiscal year that were still being integrated into the operating segment during fiscal year integration was incomplete and planned synergies were not yet realized for dage  picodostec  and yestech  and we realized that the change in business climate in fiscal year could reduce the fair value for these recent acquisitions below their carrying amounts 
during fiscal year  we recognized that revenue growth assumptions used in the original valuations could not be anticipated in the current economic cycle 
in addition  because of concerns of under performance and the impact of the economic downturn in fiscal year  we took a closer look at two prior acquisitions march plasma systems  which had goodwill resulting from two acquired companies in  and uv curing  which had goodwill resulting from two acquired companies in and the industrial coating systems operating segment suffered revenue loss in large dollar engineered systems orders from its primary automotive customers due to bankruptcies and permanent plant closures and from other industrial coating customers who placed fewer orders for large engineered systems during this difficult economic cycle 
in addition  this segment has operated with a less flexible  base cost structure  adding more risk to profitability and cash flows during economic downturns 
other indefinite lived intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are trademarks and trade names associated with dage  picodostec  yestech and tah industries 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and need to be tested for impairment annually or more often if indications of impairment exist 
testing is performed at the component level with which the asset is associated 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
after an impairment charge is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset becomes its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment charge is prohibited 
the common valuation technique for trademark and trade names is the relief from royalty method 
the theory is that these assets relieve the owner from having to pay a hypothetical royalty attributable to an exclusive license for selling products under the trademark or trade name 
the value of the hypothetical exclusive license is based upon the present value of a stream of hypothetical royalty payments  using assumptions for revenue growth the same as for goodwill testing  discount rates slightly more risk premium than for goodwill testing  royalty rates based on market data  and tax amortization benefits based upon statutory guidance 
the conclusion of this testing resulted in impairment charges totaling  as follows by reporting unit dage  picodostec  yestech  and tah industries  
table of contents other long lived assets our test for recoverability of long lived depreciable and amortizable assets used undiscounted cash flows  except for one asset group for which an external market source was available described below 
long lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
the total carrying value of long lived assets for each reporting unit has been compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit s long lived assets being tested 
cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization less annual maintenance capital spending 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset asset group are based on the remaining useful life of the asset 
we believe that the relative value of long lived assets within each reporting unit is a reasonable proxy for the relative importance of the assets in the production of cash flow 
to get to a reasonable forecast period  the aggregate net book value of long lived assets was divided by the current depreciation and amortization value to arrive at a blended remaining useful life 
for reporting units tested using this methodology  our calculations show the undiscounted aggregate value of cash flows over the remaining useful life for each reporting unit is greater than the respective carrying value of the lived assets within each reporting unit 
we have one asset group within our uv curing reporting unit for which a value obtained from an external market source was used for evaluating recoverability 
as a result  we have recognized a charge of  no further impairment procedures were necessary for our long lived asset groups 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been determined using the last in  first out lifo method for percent of consolidated inventories at october   and percent at october   with the first in  first out fifo method used for the remaining inventory 
on an ongoing basis  inventory is tested for technical obsolescence  as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions 
we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered 
inventory reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes 
the inventory reserve balance was   and  at october   and  respectively 
pension plans and postretirement medical plans the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management s assumptions related to future factors  including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  compensation increases  mortality and turnover assumptions  and health care cost trend rates 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was percent at october  and percent at october  the discount rate for these plans  which comprised percent of the worldwide pension obligations at october   was based on quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was percent at october   compared to percent at october  the discount rates used for the international plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments 
in determining the expected return on plan assets  we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans 
we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions 
the expected rate of return long term investment rate on domestic pension assets was percent for fiscal year and percent for fiscal year the average expected rate of return on international pension assets decreased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year the assumed rate of compensation increases for domestic employees was percent for both fiscal years and the assumed rate of compensation increases for international employees was percent in fiscal year  compared to percent in fiscal year 
table of contents annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year 
differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 
economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate  expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below 
bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 
united states international point point point point increase decrease increase decrease discount rate effect on total service and interest cost components in fiscal year effect on pension obligation as of october  expected return on assets effect on total service and interest cost components in fiscal year effect on pension obligation as of october  compensation increase effect on total service and interest cost components in fiscal year effect on pension obligation as of october  with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan  the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation decreased from percent at october  to percent at october  the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be percent in fiscal year  decreasing gradually to percent in fiscal year for the international postretirement plan  the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation decreased from percent at october  to percent at october  the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be percent in fiscal year  decreasing gradually to percent in fiscal year the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
for example  a one percentage point change in the discount rate and assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects united states international point point point point increase decrease increase decrease discount rate effect on total service and interest cost components in fiscal year effect on postretirement obligation as of october  health care trend rate effect on total service and interest cost components in fiscal year effect on postretirement obligation as of october  employees hired after january   are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 
pension and postretirement expenses in fiscal year are expected to be approximately  higher than fiscal year  primarily reflecting a change in the discount rate 

table of contents financial instruments assets  liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which are derivative financial instruments  to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables  payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies 
the maturities of these contracts are usually less than days 
forward contracts are marked to market each accounting period  and the resulting gains or losses are included in other net within other income expense on the consolidated statement of income 
warranties we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use 
an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period 
in determining the amount of the accrual  we rely primarily on historical warranty claims 
amounts charged to the warranty reserve were   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the reserve balance was   and  at october   and  respectively 
long term incentive compensation plan ltip under the long term incentive compensation plan  executive officers and selected other employees receive stock payouts based solely on corporate performance measures over three year performance periods 
payouts vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold  target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period 
no payout will occur unless certain threshold performance objectives are equaled or exceeded 
the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each three year period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered 
the calculation is also based upon the closing price of common shares at the dates of grant 
payouts are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders equity 
as performance did not meet the threshold  there will be no payout for the fiscal year performance period 
there was  credited to expense attributable to all ltip performance periods for executive officers and selected other employees for fiscal year there is no cumulative amount recorded in shareholders equity at october  for fiscal years and  the amounts charged to expense were  and  respectively 

table of contents fiscal years and sales as a result of the global economic slowdown  worldwide sales for fiscal year were  a decrease of percent from fiscal year sales of  sales volume decreased percent  and unfavorable currency translation effects caused by the stronger united states dollar decreased sales by an additional percent over the prior year 
sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were  in fiscal year  a decrease of  or percent  from fiscal year the change is the result of a sales volume decrease of percent and unfavorable currency translation effects that reduced sales by an additional percent 
the sales decrease was largely attributable to large dollar system product lines  with sales to consumer non durable end markets  such as packaging and nonwovens  remaining more stable 
all product lines within this segment and all geographic regions experienced sales volume decreases from the prior year 
sales of the advanced technology systems segment were  in fiscal year  a decrease of  or percent from fiscal year sales volume decreased percent  and unfavorable currency translation effects decreased sales by percent 
within the segment  volume decreases occurred in all product lines and all geographic regions largely due to reduced demand in semiconductor and consumer electronics end markets 
industrial coating systems segment sales in fiscal year were  a decrease of  or percent  from the prior year 
the decrease is the result of a sales volume decrease of percent and unfavorable currency translation effects of percent 
the sales volume decline was largely due to the lack of capital spending in consumer durable end markets 
within the segment  volume decreases occurred in all product lines and all geographic regions 
it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior fiscal year 
sales outside the united states accounted for percent of total fiscal year sales  compared to percent in fiscal year sales volume in fiscal year decreased from the prior year in all five geographic regions in which we operate 
sales volume was down percent in japan  percent in the united states  percent in europe  percent in asia pacific and percent in the americas canada  mexico and central and south america 
sales in all international regions  except japan  were negatively impacted by the stronger us dollar 
operating profit cost of sales in fiscal year was  down percent from fiscal year  due primarily to the decrease in sales volume 
currency effects reduced cost of sales by percent 
gross margins  expressed as a percent of sales  increased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year the increase was due primarily to a higher mix of consumables and aftermarket part sales compared to engineered systems sales 
the gross margin percentage was also impacted by a reduction of overhead costs related to initiatives to reduce spending in response to the economic slowdown 
selling and administrative expenses  excluding severance and restructuring costs  were  in fiscal year  a decrease of  or percent  from fiscal year the decrease was largely due to reduced compensation expenses associated with lower employment levels  furloughs  lower incentive compensation expense  and tightened control over discretionary spending 
in addition  currency translation effects decreased selling and administrative costs by percent 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year due to the lower level of sales 
in september  a cost reduction program that involved a combination of non workforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions primarily in north america and europe was announced 
in response to the continuing economic crisis  additional cost reduction actions were taken in fiscal year it is anticipated that the total severance and related costs of these actions will be approximately  of which  occurred in fiscal year and  occurred in fiscal year the remainder will occur in fiscal year severance costs were recorded in the corporate segment 

table of contents in fiscal year we recognized goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges of  of this amount   related to goodwill   related to indefinite lived trade name assets and  related to other long lived assets 
additional information regarding these charges is described in the critical accounting policies and estimates section 
operating margin was negative percent in fiscal year compared to operating profit of percent in fiscal year goodwill and long lived impairment charges accounted for percent of the percent change 
the remainder of the decrease was due primarily to the reduction in sales volume 
segment operating profit margins in fiscal years and were as follows segment adhesive dispensing systems advanced technology systems industrial coating systems operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs 
also  currency translation affects reported operating profit margins 
operating margins for each segment were unfavorably impacted by a stronger dollar during the year as compared to the prior year 
operating margin for the adhesive dispensing systems segment was percent  up from percent in fiscal year the increase was due primarily to a higher gross margin percentage resulting from a mix of more consumables and aftermarket part sales compared to engineered systems sales in fiscal year operating margin for the advanced technology systems segment was negative percent in fiscal year as compared to an operating profit margin of percent in fiscal year the change is due primarily to goodwill and long lived asset impairment and charges of  excluding these impairment charges  operating margin was percent in fiscal year the decrease from the prior year was due primarily to sales volume decreasing at a higher rate than both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses 
operating margin for the industrial coating systems segment was negative percent in fiscal year as compared to an operating profit margin of percent in fiscal year the current year includes a goodwill impairment charge of  excluding this charge  operating margin was negative percent 
the change from fiscal year was due primarily to sales volume decreasing at a higher rate than selling and administrative expenses 
interest and other income expense interest expense in fiscal year was  a decrease of  or percent from fiscal year due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates 
other income was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year included in other income expense were currency gains of  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year fiscal year also includes a  gain on the sale of real estate in westlake  ohio 
income taxes income tax expense was  in fiscal year most of the goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges in fiscal year were non deductible for income tax purposes 
income tax expense for fiscal year was  net income loss net loss was  or per diluted share in fiscal year this compares to net income of  or per diluted share in fiscal year 
table of contents recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the accounting standards codification  which establishes a sole source of us authoritative generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the codification is meant to simplify user access to all authoritative accounting guidance by reorganizing us gaap pronouncements into approximately ninety accounting topics within a consistent structure  its purpose is not to create new accounting and reporting guidance 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued a standard regarding fair value measurements 
this standard provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
it also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
in february  the fasb issued an update that permits a one year deferral of the original standard for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
as discussed in note  we adopted the non deferred portion of the standard as of november  the adoption did not impact our results of operations or financial position 
we will adopt the deferred portion of this standard effective november  in february the fasb issued a standard for reporting the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities 
this standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses on these instruments in earnings 
we did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our existing financial instruments other than those that are already being measured at fair value 
as such  the adoption of this standard on november  did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued a standard that provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations 
the standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
we must adopt this standard for all business combinations subsequent to november  the impact of adoption will depend on the nature and significance of any future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued a pronouncement that establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
we must adopt this pronouncement in our fiscal year the impact of adoption will depend on future transactions  however we currently believe the adoption will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in march  the fasb issued a standard that is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entity s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the standard applies to all derivative instruments as well as related hedged items  bifurcated derivatives  and nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments 
entities with instruments subject to this standard must provide more robust qualitative disclosures and expanded quantitative disclosures 
as discussed in note  we adopted this standard in the second quarter of fiscal year in december  the fasb issued a standard that enhances the required disclosures about plan assets in an employer s defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan  including investment allocations decisions  inputs and valuations techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risks within plan assets 
we must adopt this standard in our fiscal year  we are currently evaluating its disclosure implications 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued a standard that establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the standard requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
it sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
as discussed in note  we adopted this standard in the third quarter of fiscal year in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements that addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables 
the guidance also addresses how arrangement consideration should be allocated to separate units of accounting  when applicable  and expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable arrangements 
we must adopt this standard in fiscal year and have not yet determined the impact of adoption on our results of operations or financial position 
fiscal years and sales worldwide sales for fiscal year were  an increase of percent from fiscal year sales of  organic sales volume increased percent  while the first year effect of acquisitions accounted for percentage points of the growth 
favorable currency translation effects caused by the weaker united states dollar increased sales by an additional percent over the prior year 
sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or percent  from fiscal year the increase was split evenly between sales volume and favorable currency translation effects 
all product lines within this segment and all geographic regions experienced sales volume increases over the prior year 
sales of the advanced technology systems segment were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or percent from fiscal year the first year effect of acquisitions generated a volume increase of percent  while organic sales volume increased percent 
favorable currency translation effects contributed percent to sales growth within this segment 
the volume increase can be traced primarily to the asia pacific region  the united states and europe  as demand improved for our products in certain semiconductor and consumer electronics end markets 
industrial coating systems segment sales in fiscal year were  a decrease of  or percent  from the prior year 
the decrease is the result of a sales volume decrease of percent  partially offset by favorable currency translation effects of percent 
the sales volume decrease can be traced to recent cyclical weakness in key consumer durable goods markets  primarily in the united states 
it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior fiscal year 
sales outside the united states accounted for percent of total fiscal year sales  up from percent in fiscal year sales volume in fiscal year exceeded that of fiscal year in all five geographic regions in which we operate  largely driven by the advanced technology systems segment 
sales volume was up percent in asia pacific  percent in europe  percent in japan  percent in the united states and percent in the americas canada  mexico and central and south america 
currency translation effects favorably impacted sales in all international regions 
operating profit cost of sales in fiscal year was  up percent from fiscal year  due primarily to the increase in sales volume 
currency effects increased cost of sales by percent 
gross margins  expressed as a percent of sales  increased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year the increase was the result of the absence of short term inventory purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions that reduced the fiscal year gross margin percentage by approximately percent and favorable currency effects that increased the fiscal year gross margin rate by percent 
offsetting these items were changes in product mix that reduced the gross margin percentage 

table of contents selling and administrative expenses  excluding severance and restructuring costs  were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or percent  from fiscal year the increase is largely due to the first year effect of fiscal acquisitions  which added percent  and currency translation effects  which added percent 
annual compensation increases and higher employee benefit costs also contributed to the increase 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year  reflecting ongoing operational improvement efforts and revenue increases that were supported by existing capacity 
in september  a cost reduction program that involved a combination of non workforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions primarily in north america and europe was announced 
severance costs were  in fiscal year and were recorded in the corporate segment 
our operating profit margin increased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year purchase accounting adjustments for inventory associated with fiscal year acquisitions reduced that year s operating profit margin by percent 
the improvement was also due to favorable currency translation effects and revenue increases that were supported by existing capacity 
the operating profit margin was reduced by percent as a result of the severance and restructuring costs described above 
segment operating profit margins in fiscal years and were as follows segment adhesive dispensing systems advanced technology systems industrial coating systems operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs 
also  currency translation affects reported operating profit margins 
operating profit margins for each segment were favorably impacted by a weaker dollar during the year as compared to the prior year 
operating profit margin for the adhesive dispensing systems segment was percent  up from percent in fiscal year the increase can be traced to the increased sales volume across all product lines and geographic regions and to favorable currency translation effects 
operating profit margin for the advanced technology systems segment increased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of sales volume increasing at a higher rate than operating costs and the absence of the effect of short term purchase accounting adjustments related to fiscal year acquisitions  partially offset by changes in sales mix 
operating profit margin for the industrial coating systems segment was percent in fiscal year as compared to percent in fiscal year the decrease in the operating profit margin is due primarily to a sales volume decrease of percent and to a higher mix of lower margin system sales 
interest and other income expense interest expense in fiscal year was  a decrease of  or percent from fiscal year due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates 
other income was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year included in other income expense were currency gains of  in fiscal year and currency losses of  in fiscal year the prior year amount also included a  gain on the sale leaseback of real estate 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was percent in fiscal year  up from percent in fiscal year the increased rate is due primarily to a favorable adjustment in fiscal year related to a prior year tax revision 
net income net income was  or per diluted share in fiscal year this compares to net income of  or per diluted share in fiscal year this represents a percent increase in net income and a percent increase in earnings per share 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations in fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year the primary sources were net income loss adjusted for non cash expenses and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options  totaling  compared to  in fiscal year also included in cash provided by operations in the current year were changes in operating assets and liabilities of  as compared to fiscal year when operating assets and liabilities used  of cash 
the primary reason for the change is the lower level of business activity in the current year resulting in lower operating assets 
cash used by investing activities was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year capital expenditures were  in fiscal year  down from  in the prior year due to tighter spending control in the current year 
fiscal year capital expenditures were primarily focused on our in process rollout of sap enterprise management software and various projects that improve manufacturing and distribution 
proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment in the current year were  and primarily consisted of the sale of our westlake  ohio corporate headquarters building and a portion of the real property surrounding the building 
included in cash used by investing activities in fiscal year was  for the acquisition of businesses and the minority interest in a south korea joint venture 
cash of  was used for financing activities in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the current year included net repayments of  of short and long term borrowings  compared to  in the prior year 
issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated  of cash in the current year  down from  in the prior year due to fewer stock option exercises 
purchases of treasury shares used  of cash in fiscal year  down from  in fiscal year  as we focused on repayment of debt in the current year 
dividend payments were  in fiscal year  up slightly from  in fiscal year due to an increase in the quarterly dividend from per share to per share in the fourth quarter of the current year 
the following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from the end of fiscal year to the end of fiscal year receivables  inventories and accounts payable decreased due primarily to lower level of business activity in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year long term deferred tax assets increased due primarily to deferred taxes related to pension and postretirement adjustments to other comprehensive income 
regarding the increase in income taxes payable  the balance at the end of fiscal year was reduced to record an expected refund that was received during fiscal year accrued liabilities decreased due primarily to lower incentive compensation accruals 
the increase in long term pension and retirement liabilities is due primarily to lower discount rates in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year on february   we entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement the agreement with prudential investment management  inc the agreement consists of a  senior note and a  private shelf facility 
the senior note bears interest at a rate of percent and matures on february  the agreement also contains customary events of default and covenants related to limitations on indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at october  under the private shelf facility  we may also borrow during the next three years up to  at interest rates in effect at the time of borrowing 
borrowings can be for up to years with an average life not to exceed years 
at october   the amount we could borrow under the private shelf facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants 
the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  of our common shares over a three year period beginning november the resolution was amended in august permitting the use of written agreements with independent third party brokers to purchase common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs  including stock options  restricted stock and k matching 
shares purchased are treated as treasury shares until used for such purposes 
the repurchase program is funded using working capital 
during fiscal year  we repurchased shares at a cost of  completing the repurchases authorized under this program 

table of contents on december   the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to  shares over a three year period beginning december  expected uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options  nonvested stock and k matching 
there have been no shares repurchased under this program 
the following table summarizes obligations as of october  payments due by period less than after obligations total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases notes payable interest payments on long term debt contributions related to pension and postretirement benefits deferred compensation payouts purchase obligations total obligations we have a  unsecured  multicurrency credit facility with a group of banks that expires in fiscal year and may be increased to  under certain conditions 
at october    was outstanding under this facility  compared to  outstanding at october  there are two primary financial covenants that must be met under this facility 
the first covenant limits the amount of total indebtedness that can be incurred to times consolidated trailing ebitda both indebtedness and ebitda as defined in the credit agreement 
the second covenant requires consolidated trailing ebitda to be at least three times consolidated trailing interest expense both as defined in the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at october  at october   the amount we could borrow under the credit facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants 
we have various lines of credit with foreign banks totaling  of which  was unused at october  pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after fiscal year will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time 
we believe that the combination of present capital resources  internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for fiscal year there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 

table of contents outlook disruptions in global financial markets and resulting turmoil in the general economic environment during fiscal year likely will have a continuing impact on our performance in fiscal year  however  we are confident that we are well positioned to manage the impact upon our liquidity 
our liquidity needs arise from working capital requirements  capital expenditures and principal and interest payments on indebtedness 
primary sources of capital to meet these needs are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements 
in fiscal year  cash from operations was percent of revenue 
comparatively  during the and recession years  cash from operations were percent and percent  respectively  and then ranged from percent to percent in subsequent years until fiscal year funds provided by borrowings occur under a  five year committed revolving line of credit with domestic and international banks that expires in as of october  we were in compliance with the financial covenant of this credit facility and have  available borrowing capacity 
in addition  in february  we entered into a master shelf arrangement with the prudential insurance company to allow for the issuance of medium to long term unsecured notes 
as of october   we are in compliance with the financial covenant relating to a  five year note issued under this arrangement 
while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing  we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event of these financial institutions failure to remain sufficiently capitalized 
we are taking a cautious approach to fiscal year our priorities for fiscal year are focused on the continuation of strategic actions taken in fiscal year to optimize revenue opportunities in a challenging economic environment and to sustain the operational improvements achieved through a combination of non workforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions 
given our assumption that economic challenges will continue to impact us in fiscal year  we expect these efforts will provide sufficient cash from operations to meet our liquidity needs 
with respect to spending  the table above presents nordson s financial obligations for the long term as  of which  is payable in fiscal year on december   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to  shares 
under this authorization  the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations  cash requirements for acquisitions  repayment of debt and our share price 
capital expenditures for fiscal year will be focused primarily upon our in process rollout of sap  various facility projects that improve manufacturing and distribution  and a new corporate facility to replace the building sold in fiscal year as the economic climate improves  we will continue to look for strategic acquisition opportunities 
we will continue to develop new applications and markets for our technologies  and move forward with additional lean and other operational initiatives to enhance our financial performance 
effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices  sales volume  product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate 
as a general rule  a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income  while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect 
in fiscal year  as compared with fiscal year  the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies 
if fiscal year exchange rates had been in effect during fiscal year  sales would have been approximately  higher and third party costs would have been approximately  higher 
in fiscal year  as compared with fiscal year  the united states dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies 
if fiscal year exchange rates had been in effect during fiscal year  sales would have been approximately  lower and third party costs would have been approximately  lower 
these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
consequently  we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled 
we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions 
these contracts  primarily associated with the euro  yen and british pound  typically have maturities of days or less  and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts 
gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains  respectively  on the underlying transactions 
other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a long term investment nature 
as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies  as of october   we did not have material foreign currency exposure 
note to the financial statements contains additional information about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions 
a portion of our operations is financed with short term and long term borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
the tables that follow present principal repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of fixed rate debt 
at october  there total fair after value value long term debt  including current portion average interest rate at october  there total fair after value value long term debt  including current portion average interest rate we also have variable rate notes payable and long term debt 
the weighted average interest rate of this debt was percent at october  and percent at october  a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately  on the variable rate notes payable and long term debt in fiscal year 
table of contents inflation inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing 
although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements  we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity 
trends the five year summary in item documents our historical financial trends
