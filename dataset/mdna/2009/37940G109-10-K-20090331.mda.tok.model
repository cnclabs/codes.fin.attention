overview we develop  distribute and maintain secure managed file transfer  or mft  software for individuals and businesses to safely send files over the internet  within an enterprise  or to business partners 
we have also developed wide area file services  or wafs  collaboration and continuous data protection  or cdp  software 
these solutions further enhance the ability to share and backup files within the infrastructure of a company s wide and local area networks  or wan and lan at local network speeds 
in addition  we announced managed e mail attachment and software as a service  or saas  information sharing solutions in the e mail attachment delivery and saas solutions broaden our product portfolio to address the substantial installed base of it systems with e mail attachment size limitations and other file delivery infrastructure constraints 
our product portfolio facilitates delivery of critical information such as financial data  medical records  customer files and other similar documents while supporting a range of information protection approaches to meet privacy and other security requirements 
in addition  these solutions ensure compliance with some government regulations relating to the protection of information while allowing users to reduce it costs  increase efficiency  track and audit transactions and automate processes 
our products also provide data replication  acceleration of file transfer  sharing collaboration and continuous data backup and recovery to our customers 
we 
table of contents believe that we are strongly positioned to provide secure transfer  sharing  and replication of files that need to be transmitted inside the user s firewall to distributed offices  or outside the user s firewall to business and trading partners 
we believe these business to business  or bb  aspects of our solution capabilities increasingly will allow us to address adjacent market demands beyond the traditional mft market space 
the following is a brief description of our products and solutions file management products our file management products are best known for the cuteftp product line 
they primarily consist of products that help users securely move and copy files on the internet 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from licensing our file management products 
some of our products encrypt the transfers for security using technology similar to a web browser 
the products consist of three product categories  client  server and compression transfer 
our file management product line includes enhanced file transfer  or eft server  secure ftp server  cuteftp professional  cuteftp home  and cuteftp lite 
wide area file services and continuous data protection products our wafs products provide a file sharing  collaboration  and replication solution over multiple sites 
by keeping all data updated on each location s file server  each site has instant access to the very latest version 
our wafs products help prevent opening an old file version without user conflicts 
changes made to data on any server are mirrored on all other servers 
wafs technology can have cdp added to it to provide enterprises with a file access and data protection combination that centralizes data storage and it administration facilities but doesn t compromise data sharing and protection 
as files change  file servers backup in real time to the customer s backup site which can be at the same or a remote location 
the backup server can keep any number of past versions of each file and deleted files which gives the customer immediate restore  as well as the ability to perform point in time snapshots 
managed e mail attachment solutions our managed e mail attachment solution  mail express  addresses the needs of businesses that prefer to use their legacy e mail infrastructure to deliver and manage e mail attachments 
e mail traditionally has been ill suited to delivery of certain attachments due to typical infrastructure and administrator defined limitations on e mail attachment size 
in many cases  these limitations preclude sending or receiving e mail attachments larger than even or mb 
mail express allows delivery of multi gb files as e mail attachments by seamlessly replacing the attachments with links to the files 
this approach can ease the load on the e mail infrastructure and the long term storage requirements associated with e mail attachments 
mail express also allows enhanced tracking and auditing of the file attachments through read receipts and log files 
software as a service solution our saas solution  cutesendit  is a file transfer service for individuals  professionals  and businesses 
cutesendit uses cloud computing approaches to deliver files through a hosted web portal 
this solution approach meets the needs of users who do not have  or wish to invest in  file transfer infrastructure such as ftp servers or even client application software 
users access the cutesendit application over the internet using a standard web browser  securely upload files up to multi gb through the portal  and compose a brief message to accompany the file delivery 
cutesendit then sends the message to the recipients as the body of an e mail message 
this e mail message also includes links to the files uploaded through the cutesendit web portal 
anyone with an internet connection can access this service at www 
cutesendit 
com 
there is no software to install with cutesendit and no specific knowledge of file transfer is needed to use it 
cutesendit currently is free to use for a limited number of transfers  and offers various monthly and yearly fee based plans that meet specific file transfer requirements 
we believe that the future success of our business will be dependent upon our ability to improve our current products and to introduce new products  through research and development  innovations by our employees  strategic partnerships  and possible acquisitions 
we intend to continue enhancing our file transfer products to meet the demands of both individual and enterprise users  and to expand into growing markets through strategic partnerships and possible future acquisitions of compatible companies and solutions 

table of contents during  we released several enhancements to our established product lines 
for example  we introduced an applicability statement  or as  add on module for eft server 
the as add on module allows manufacturing and retail customers to efficiently connect their supply chains to key suppliers and trading partners 
many organizations are migrating to this protocol to reduce costs  and requiring their trading partners to switch to the as protocol 
the as add on module continues our prior practice of developing and releasing additional modules that provide additional sales and up sell opportunities for our server based file management products 
previously introduced solutions include auditing and reporting arm  secure ad hoc transfer sat  and high security payment card industry hs pci modules 
we also released cuteftp lite and localized versions of cuteftp during cuteftp lite has a relatively simple user interface and adds an entry level ftp product to our consumer product portfolio 
the localizations of cuteftp delivered during provided simplified chinese  russian  spanish  german  french  portuguese and turkish versions of this popular consumer product and should  over time  enhance our ability to penetrate international markets 
during  we continued to develop our wafs and cdp products  focusing on enhancements aligned with our other server product development approaches 
in particular  we updated the software using customer service feedback and our standard software development practices 
the wafs update included a significant part of the software originally acquired from availl 
our wafs cdp revenues continued to lag behind management estimates during as we continued to develop the necessary product enhancements 
management believes the overall wafs market growth outlook has slowed considerably as well  based on conversations with industry analysts and sales trends observed during the wafs sales led to the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets associated with the acquisition of availl 
our continued product enhancements yielded important industry validations and recognition during for example  the globalscape cryptographic module embedded in the secure ftp server product achieved federal information processing standards  or fips  level validation 
fips specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules used to protect sensitive information 
to achieve validation  cryptographic modules are subjected to rigorous testing by independent  accredited test facilities 
fips validation is required by most government departments  including the department of defense  to protect the integrity of files that cross their networks 
similarly  companies in the healthcare  financial and manufacturing markets are under pressure to ensure that customer and patient information is protected 
secure ftp server fips version and cuteftp pro version also received the certificate of networthiness con from the us army network technology command netcom during a con is required for all systems operating within the army enterprise infrastructure  or aei 
the aei includes the key information technology systems that provide the army with agile and adaptive capabilities  powered by net centric  interoperable access to knowledge  systems  and services 
the con signifies successful completion of a stringent assessment to ensure army automated information systems are secure  supportable  sustainable  and compatible with the aei 
our receipt of this certificate enables army installations worldwide to install and operate secure ftp server fips version and cuteftp pro version in addition to product enhancements  we released two new solutions mail express and cutesendit during mail express broadens our solution portfolio to include direct  seamless integration with e mail delivery systems such as microsoft outlook 
mail express potentially allows us to leverage our mft capabilities into a substantial installed base of e mail solutions 
cutesendit additionally introduces a saas solution to our portfolio 
the saas solution is particularly attractive to some customers because it uses cloud computing approaches to deliver large files without requiring on premises equipment installations or even customer awareness of the specific file delivery systems and associated technologies 
we intend to use strategic partnerships or acquisitions as necessary to further enhance our solution portfolio  expand our sales channels  and enter adjacent markets 
for example  during we joined the cisco technology developer program as part of the program s unified communications solution category 
the cisco 
table of contents technology developer program unites cisco with third party developers of hardware and software to deliver tested interoperable solutions to joint customers 
in addition  we established qbs distribution as a channel partner to enhance distribution of globalscape s market leading secure file transfer software in the uk and ireland 
the entire globalscape product line is available through qbs distribution 
our accomplishments during and in prior years resulted in the company being positioned in the leader s quadrant of the gartner magic quadrant for the mft market 
the magic quadrant  and associated gartner report  helps companies evaluate mft vendors based on their ability to execute  and completeness of vision 
from this position of mft market leadership  we are positioned to assess and potentially pursue entry into adjacent market spaces as our business traction and economic conditions indicate the potential attractiveness of these markets 
liquidity and capital resources the company has a strong working capital position resulting from net profits from operations over of the last consecutive quarters and capital raised in a equity sale 
at december   our net working capital position was approximately million 
we had cash available of million and we continue to generate cash from operating activities 
the company had a  line of credit with silicon valley bank which expired in september that was never used and the company chose not to seek renewal 
we rely on existing cash and cash flows from operations to fund our operations 
our capital requirements principally relate to our need to enhance our existing products and to develop new products  which primarily consist of research and development expenses and expenses for people and the elements that support their work 
by comparison  we do not spend large sums on capital equipment 
over the past three years  we spent  in   in and  in for equipment 
capital expenditures were higher in primarily as a result of the move to new office space in san antonio 
our total revenues decreased in when compared to this decrease in revenue is attributable mostly to the inclusion of a single million us army sale in our revenues 
excluding this sale  our total revenues increased by in when compared to our enterprise level server products for mft  eft server and secureftp server  plus associated modules accounted for of our revenues in  including maintenance and support agreements 
prior to  we were largely dependent upon sales of cuteftp home and cuteftp professional  which accounted for of our revenue in the year ended december   and represented larger percentages of sales in earlier years 
the actual sales of these products remained relatively flat during and  and declined by approximately in when compared to in  sales of these products represented approximately of our total revenues 
wafs and cdp combined for approximately of our revenues in  the same as in because our principal sources of capital are cash on hand and cash flow from operations  to the extent that sales decline  our cash flow from operations will also decline 
if sales decline or if our liquidity is otherwise under duress  management could substantially reduce discretionary and capital spending  and personnel related expenditures 
we may also sell equity securities or enter into credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions or licensing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
this increase in cash for each year is generally the result of net income 
significant non cash add backs in include the goodwill and long lived asset impairment  offset by a large non cash decrease in deferred taxes 
the remainder of the change in cash provided by operating activities is due to changes in working capital 
our investing activities have typically been for the purchase of computer equipment and software 
however in  approximately million was used for the purchase of availl and in a large portion of our investing activities was related to the move into our new office space 

table of contents our financing activities over the past three years have primarily related to funding the acquisition of availl 
the cash used to make this acquisition came from a million term loan from silicon valley bank 
we repaid  of the loan in and million in from the cash generated from our operations and a stock offering completed in november we have also sold stock through the exercise of employee stock options 
we also used our own cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock  in the amount of  and  in and  respectively 
in order to finance the cash portion of the purchase price in the purchase of availl  globalscape entered into a loan and security agreement dated september  with silicon valley bank 
the loan agreement with silicon valley bank provided for a million term loan and a  revolving credit facility 
we repaid the balance of the term loan on march  the revolving credit facility expired in september and no borrowings were made against it 
at december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases as well as royalty agreements with third parties  federal income tax and trade accounts payable 
the commitments related to royalty agreements are contingent on sales volumes 
we plan to continue to expend significant resources on product development in future periods and may also use our cash to acquire or license technology  intellectual property  products or businesses related to our current business strategy 
we moved to a new san antonio facility in we may purchase additional fixed assets and make additional leasehold improvements in connection with moving into this facility 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   consisting of future minimum payments under operating leases payments due by fiscal year and thereafter total contractual obligations building lease equipment leases new accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb finalized staff position fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
the position amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the position applies to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and both intangible assets acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions 
fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the implementation of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  business combinations 
this standard changes the accounting for business combinations by requiring that an acquiring entity measures and recognizes identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
the changes include the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs  the valuation of any noncontrolling interest at acquisition date fair value  the recording of acquired contingent liabilities at acquisition date fair value and the subsequent re measurement of such liabilities after acquisition date  the recognition of capitalized in process research and development  the accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals subsequent to acquisition date  and the recognition of changes in the acquirer s income tax valuation allowance 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption prohibited 

table of contents we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material impact on our financial statements unless we undertake an acquisition in and beyond 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company did not elect the fair value option on january  and this statement will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements and related disclosures 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  accounting for research and development costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry  including statement of position  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin sab nos 
and  revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a non cancelable written agreement signed by us and the customer to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when a compact disc or other medium containing the licensed software is provided to a common carrier or in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given electronic access to the licensed software 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment  we recognize revenue when the refund or adjustment right lapses or the return is estimable 
for arrangements with extended payment terms  we recognize revenue as amounts become due and payable or as cash is collected 
we grant a limited right of return to our customers 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  revenue is deferred and recognized upon cash collection 
in arrangements that include multiple elements  including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  and packaged products with content updates  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as 
table of contents revenue 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance  consumer product support  and arrangements where vsoe does not exist 
deferred revenue totaled approximately million as of december   of which approximately  was classified as other long term liabilities in the balance sheets 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
while the above noted accounting standards govern the basis for revenue recognition  judgment and the use of estimates are required in connection with the allocation of revenue between software license revenue and maintenance and support revenue  as well as the amount of deferred revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill 
we assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite life for impairment within our reporting units annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the provisions of sfas require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the equity assigned to that unit  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the equity assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of that reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess 
to determine the reporting units fair value in the current year evaluation  we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  growth rates and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly 
such change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
during the performance of our annual impairment test and in conjunction with our budgeting process a review of the projected future sales of our wafs cdp products showed a significant decrease in expected future revenues 
this decrease was a significant contributing factor in the goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of other identifiable intangible assets according to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of long lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many triggering factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition 
the availl purchase largely gained us rights to software  the value of the software on our books and goodwill are linked 
therefore the same analysis of future sales that led us to determine there was a goodwill impairment also led to an impairment of the acquired 
table of contents asset 
during fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million primarily for the write down of identified intangible assets related to the availl acquisition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly assess the collectability of outstanding customer invoices and  in so doing  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current creditworthiness  customer concentration  age of the receivable balance  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates and exceed our related loss allowance 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fin under fin  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

we derive our revenues primarily from software sales 
revenue is comprised of the gross selling price of software  including shipping charges and the earned portion of maintenance and support agreements 
revenues decreased from  in to  in the decrease of approximately million or approximately in revenues was attributable to a million sale to the us army in excluding this sale  revenues increased by  in or of revenues as compared to we believe this revenue performance  while positive  reflects the economic turmoil experienced during the second half of the following table reflects revenue by product including the related maintenance and support for each product product revenue for the year ended december  enhanced file transfer server secureftp server cuteftp professional cuteftp home wafs cdp all others deferred revenue adjustment total revenues maintenance and support net of deferred revenues sales of our secureftp server and eft server products declined by  to million in from million in this decrease in revenue was attributable mostly to the inclusion of a single million us army order for secureftp server and cuteftp in our revenues 
excluding this single order  sales of secureftp server and eft server increased by in when compared to in total  our secure ftp server and enhanced file transfer products represented approximately of our total revenues in as compared to in revenues from cuteftp decreased by from million in to million in and accounted for approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
this decrease was the result of 
table of contents the continuing maturity of the cuteftp product line and the availability of low cost alternatives to occasional users 
we believe that our reliance on the cuteftp products  and the percentage of revenue derived from these products  will continue to decline as we continue to grow sales of our enterprise products 
in addition  because of the more complex nature of secureftp server  enhanced file transfer  wafs and cdp compared to cuteftp  purchasers of those products require increased maintenance and support 
as a result  our maintenance and support revenues increased by from  in to  in  net of deferred revenue 
maintenance and support pricing is reflective of the license cost of the products and the additional support it takes to maintain and support the products and customers 
with higher maintenance and support revenues  we will recognize additional deferred revenue as we earn the revenue over the life of the maintenance and support agreement 
wafs and cdp products accounted for approximately of total revenue for  approximately the same percentage of revenue as in the wafs cdp revenues have not increased as originally anticipated due to continued development activity necessary to position the product for broader market adoption 
the amount of time required to make improvements to our wafs and cdp products that we believe are necessary have been greater than originally expected 
we plan to release an upgraded version of the wafs software in the first half of and expect this version will solidify the revenue for this product line and provide a platform for further development 
we introduced our managed e mail attachment solution mail express late in and expect to gain market traction with this product during similarly  we launched cutesendit as a saas solution in mid and believe it will contribute synergistically to additional sales of our other solutions 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of royalties  a portion of our bandwidth costs as well as production  packaging and shipping costs for boxed copies of software products 
cost of revenues decreased by approximately between periods from  in to  in royalty expenses  the major component of cost of revenues  declined primarily as the result of the non renewal of the third party software distribution agreement with beehive  hannon hill  g k  and visicom 
royalties that we pay on software products licensed from third parties  which we resell  are expensed as a cost of sales when the software product is sold or earlier if the recoverability of any prepaid royalties is in doubt 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses  marketing  customer support  professional fees  rent  bad debt and credit card transaction fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately from  in to  in as a percentage of revenue  sg a increased to of revenue in from of revenue in these increases were primarily the result of significant increases in salary and wage and advertising expenses as well as increases in recruiting  health insurance  office rent  board of director fees  restructuring costs and bad debt expense 
these increases were offset by decreases in professional fees  meals and entertainment  certifications  sec fees  and contract labor 
the increases in salary expense of  were largely due to the addition of several highly paid employees including a new ceo  coo  a high level senior engineer and three sales staff for the mail express product line  as well as the payment of severance to two retired executives 
the higher recruiting costs of  were a result of the search for the ceo and cfo positions that were open during the year 
increased office rent of  was due to the new facility that we moved into in may  and increased bad debt expense of  was due to a change in estimate methodology 
restructuring costs of  were due to the closing of the andover  massachusetts office in december the  decrease in professional fees was largely due to items in that did not recur in  namely a stock offering and a research and development tax credit study 
meals and entertainment expenses decreased  as a result of fewer people traveling back and forth to the andover office in as compared 
table of contents to and no sales promotion trip in certifications decreased  due to the reversal of a previous accrual 
the company had accrued amounts in anticipation of obtaining certain industry certifications during the certifications that related to that accrual did not occur and therefore the accrual was reversed in sec fees decreased  due to the non recurring fees charged in related to the stock offering and contract labor decreased  due to a web developer used in that was not used again in research and development 
research and development expenses increased by approximately from  in to  in based on a strategic decision to focus on product development 
this increase was largely due to the addition of employees in the engineering department 
overall  we have grown our research and development capability to deliver enhanced versions of our legacy products while defining  developing  and launching new solutions 
during  we also implemented an improved go to market process to further facilitate new concept research and development 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation expense related to our fixed assets and amortization of capitalized development costs and intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by  or approximately  year over year 
this increase was largely related to the amortization of intangible assets 
in there was only three months of amortization versus a full year in also  a change in estimated useful life  from years to years  of one of the assets during fourth quarter caused an increase of approximately  in addition  depreciation increased due to an increase in leasehold improvements due to the move into the new office space 
impairment 
during we performed an analysis of the future expected cash flows from the sale of the wafs and cdp products 
this analysis revealed a significant decrease in cash flows as compared to original expectations when availl was purchase in therefore in accordance with us gaap an impairment charge of million was recorded against the goodwill and an impairment charge of million was recorded against the software intangible asset 
other income expense  net 
other income expense increased  or from to this increase was due to an increase in interest income earned  which was largely the function of a larger cash balance  in addition to decreased interest expense in as compared to the lower interest expense was due to the payoff of the loan balance during income taxes 
our effective income rates were approximately and for and  respectively

table of contents revenue 
revenues increased from  in to  in the increase of million  or approximately  was the result of increased sales of our waf systems  secure ftp server systems and eft products 
in addition  in may  we received a substantial order from the us army for secure ftp server  ssh module and cuteftp professional software licenses  with maintenance  starting at an initial purchase of million in software licenses and  in initial maintenance and support revenue through may this sale represented approximately of our revenues in the following table reflects revenue by product including the related maintenance and support for each product product revenue for the year ended december  enhanced file transfer secureftp server cuteftp professional cuteftp home wafs cdp all others deferred revenue adjustment total revenues maintenance and support net of deferred revenues sales of our secureftp server and enhanced file transfer products grew by in to million  from million in this increase was the result of the continuing emphasis of our internal sales group to market and sell these products to meet the needs of businesses to transfer files in a secure fashion using business or enterprise level software as well as the million sale to the us army described above 
in total  our secure ftp server and enhanced file transfer products represented approximately of our total revenues in as compared to in revenues from cuteftp home and cuteftp professional increased by and accounted for approximately and of total revenues and  respectively 
those changes were the result of the continuing maturity of cuteftp and cuteftp pro  and the availability of low cost alternatives to occasional users 
we believe that our reliance on the cuteftp products will continue to decline as we emphasize sales of our more complex enterprise products 
in addition  because of the more complex nature of secureftp server  enhanced file transfer  wafs and cdp  purchasers require increased maintenance and support 
as a result  our maintenance and support revenues increased by from  in to  in  net of deferred revenue 
maintenance and support pricing is reflective of the license cost of the products and the additional support it takes to maintain and support the products and customers 
with higher maintenance and support revenues  we will recognize additional deferred revenue as we earn the revenue over the life of the maintenance and support agreement 
wafs and cdp products accounted for approximately of total revenue for there was only  in sales for these products in because we did not begin selling these products until after completing the availl acquisition in september the wafs cdp revenues have not increased as originally anticipated due to management s decision to delay the aggressive marketing of those products to our existing customer base and to the market in general as soon as we had initially planned
