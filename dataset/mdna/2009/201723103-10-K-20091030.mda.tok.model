this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this annual report 
we recycle  manufacture  market and distribute steel and metal products through a network of over locations in the united states and internationally 
our business is organized into the following five segments americas recycling  americas mills  americas fabrication and distribution  international mills and international fabrication and distribution 
our domestic and international distribution business activities consist only of physical transactions and not market speculation 
americas recycling operations we conduct our recycling operations through metal processing plants located in the states of alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  kansas  louisiana  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  south carolina  tennessee and texas 
americas mills operations we conduct our domestic mills operations through a network of steel mills  commonly referred to as minimills  that produce reinforcing bar  angles  flats  rounds  fence post sections and other shapes  and a copper tube minimill 
our copper tube minimill is aggregated with the company s steel minimills because it has similar economic characteristics 
americas fabrication and distribution operations we conduct our domestic fabrication operations through a network of steel fabrication and processing plants that bend  weld  cut  fabricate  distribute and place steel  primarily reinforcing bar and angles  warehouses that sell or rent products for the installation of concrete  
table of contents plants that produce special sections for floors and support for ceilings and floors  plants that produce steel fence posts  and plants that treat steel with heat to strengthen and provide flexibility 
additionally  our domestic distribution includes our cmc dallas trading division which markets and distributes semi finished  long and flat steel products into the americas from a diverse base of international and domestic sources 
international mills operations international mills includes our polish cmcz and croatian cmcs mills and have been presented as a separate segment because the economic characteristics of the market and the regulatory environment in which our international mills operate is different from our domestic minimills 
we conduct our international mill operations through a rolling mill that produces primarily reinforcing bar and high quality merchant products  a rolling mill that produces primarily wire rod  our scrap processing facilities that directly support the cmcz minimill  and an electric arc furnace based steel pipe manufacturer 
international fabrication and distribution operations we conduct our international fabrication operations through four steel fabrication plants in europe primarily for reinforcing bar and mesh 
additionally  we market and distribute steel  copper and aluminum coil  sheet and tubing  ores  metal concentrates  industrial minerals  ferroalloys and chemicals through our network of marketing and distribution offices  processing facilities and joint ventures internationally 
our customers use these products in a variety of industries 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following are important accounting policies  estimates and assumptions that you should understand as you review our financial statements 
we apply these accounting policies and make these estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our use of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions affects our results of operations and our reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
where we have used estimates or assumptions  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped or when they are delivered based on the terms of the sale  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
when we estimate that a contract with one of our customers will result in a loss  we accrue the calculated loss as soon as it is probable and estimable 
we account for fabrication projects in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
these reserves are based on historical trends  current market conditions and customer s financial condition 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the 
table of contents long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular quarter 
inventory cost we determine inventory cost for most domestic inventories by the last in  first out method  or lifo 
we calculate our lifo reserve by using quantities and costs at year end and recording the resulting lifo income or expense in its entirety 
inventory cost for international and remaining inventories is determined by the first in  first out method  or fifo 
we record all inventories at the lower of their cost or market value 
goodwill we test for impairment of goodwill by estimating the fair value of each reporting unit compared to its carrying value 
we use a discounted cash flow model to calculate the fair value of our reporting units 
the model includes a number of significant assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows including discount rates  volumes  prices  capital expenditures and the impact of current market conditions 
we perform the goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter each fiscal year and when changes in circumstances indicate an impairment event may have occurred 
we incurred no impairment charges of goodwill for the years ended august   and property  plant and equipment our domestic and international mills  fabrication and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
we evaluate the value of these assets and other long lived assets whenever a change in circumstances indicates that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
some of the estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations are based upon judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce 
if these assets were for sale  our estimates of their values could be significantly different because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
also  we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on our estimate of the assets economically useful lives and are evaluated annually 
to the extent that an asset s actual life differs from our estimate  there could be an impact on depreciation expense or a gain loss on the disposal of the asset in a later period 
we expense major maintenance costs as incurred 
other accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations year ended august  in millions except share data net sales net earnings per diluted share ebitda international net sales as of total sales lifo income expense effect on net earnings per diluted share excludes the net sales of a division classified as discontinued operations 
last in  first out inventory valuation method 
in the table above  we have included a financial statement measure that was not derived in accordance with gaap 
we use ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization as a non gaap performance measure 
in calculating ebitda  we exclude our largest recurring non cash charge  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal  state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions 
tax regulations in international operations add additional complexity 
also  we exclude interest cost in our calculation of ebitda 
the results are  therefore  without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed 
we use ebitda as one guideline to assess our unleveraged performance return on our investments 
ebitda is also the target benchmark for our long term cash incentive performance plan for management 
reconciliations to net earnings are provided below for the years ended august 
table of contents in millions net earnings interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda from discontinued operations ebitda from continuing operations includes asset impairment charges 
ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenues 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
also  the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our operations 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is appropriate to consider both net earnings determined under gaap  as well as ebitda  to evaluate our performance 
also  we separately analyze any significant fluctuations in interest expense  depreciation and amortization and income taxes 
the following events and performances had a significant financial impact during as compared to or are expected to be significant for our future operations overall  net sales decreased due to a significant reduction in prices and volume 
in response to price declines  demand destruction  and a global liquidity crisis  we recorded the following consolidated expenses during lower of cost or market inventory adjustments of million  other charges relating to contractual noncompliance of million  bad debt expense of million and severance costs of million 
we recorded after tax lifo income of per diluted share compared to lifo expense of million per diluted share in net sales of the americas recycling segment decreased significantly during as a result of weak demand causing a decline in both prices and shipments as well as an adjusted operating loss of million 
net sales of the americas mills segment decreased from due to the decrease in the average selling price and a decline in shipments  while adjusted operating profit increased from due mainly to pre tax lifo income 
our americas fabrication and distribution segment showed a decrease in sales primarily from a decline in shipments but achieved a million increase in adjusted operating profit loss over attributable to pre tax lifo income of million and margin expansion from the deflation in material costs 
our international mills segment reported a decline in net sales and adjusted operating profit loss compared to due primarily from rapidly falling sales prices within weak international steel markets  metal margin compression  mill start up costs and lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
our international fabrication and distribution segment incurred an adjusted operating loss of million due primarily from reductions in market demand and inventory valuations adjustments caused by declining prices 
significant construction projects in  which are as follows caster upgrades at cmcs which were completed in august  micro mill in arizona with a start up date of september  new flexible 
table of contents section mill in cmcz with expected completion in january and melt shop upgrades at cmcs with expected completion in february expense of million and capital expenditures of million were recorded during as compared to expense of million and capital expenditures of million recorded during related to the global implementation of sap 
at august   we successfully ended the project phase of our deployment of sap  returned significant personnel resources back to our operating units  and combined sap expertise with our it organization 
we will continue the deployment of sap on a more measured pace and enhance our supply chain management benefits by optimizing the use of the system 
as a result  sap will no longer be reported as a separate project 
we finished winding down the operations of our discontinued operation in resulting in a slight gain 
segments unless otherwise indicated  all dollars below are before minority interests and income taxes 
financial results for our reportable segments are consistent with the basis and manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information for making operating decisions 
see note  business segments  to the consolidated financial statements 
we use adjusted operating profit loss to compare and evaluate the financial performance of our segments 
adjusted operating profit loss is the sum of our earnings loss before income taxes and financing costs 
adjusted operating profit loss is equal to earnings loss before income taxes for americas mills and americas fabrication and distribution segments because these segments require minimal outside financing 
the following table shows net sales and adjusted operating profit loss by business segment year ended august  in millions net sales americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication and distribution international mills international fabrication and distribution corporate eliminations discontinued operations adjusted operating profit loss americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication and distribution international mills international fabrication and distribution corporate eliminations lifo impact on adjusted operating profit loss lifo is an inventory costing method that assumes the most recent inventory purchases or goods manufactured are sold first 
this results in current sales prices offset against current inventory costs 
in periods of rising prices it has the effect of eliminating inflationary profits from net income 
in periods of declining prices it has the effect of eliminating deflationary losses from net income 
in either case the goal is to reflect economic profit 
the table below reflects lifo income or expense representing decreases or increases in the lifo inventory reserve 
international mills is not included in this table as it uses fifo valuation exclusively for its inventory

compared to americas recycling during  this segment experienced a decline in scrap prices and market demand resulting in reduced net sales and an adjusted operating loss as compared to  a year with record operating results 
the decline in gross margins for ferrous and nonferrous was almost evenly attributable to both volume and prices as compared to the decrease in margins was partially offset by a swing of million in lifo income due to declining prices during ferrous and nonferrous pricing reversed the declining trends of the opening six months of fiscal we exported of our ferrous scrap and of our nonferrous scrap during the year 
the following table reflects our americas recycling segment s average selling prices per ton and tons shipped in thousands for the year ended august decrease amount average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped total volume processed and shipped americas mills we include our four domestic steel minimills and our copper tube minimill in our americas mills segment 
while this segment had a decrease in net sales during as compared to  adjusted operating profit increased due to lifo income recorded in as compared to lifo expense recorded in within the segment  adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for as compared to million for metal margins increased over primarily due to rapidly declining ferrous scrap prices in excess of selling prices and a swing in lifo income of million 
tons shipped declined as compared to  but were rising late in fiscal as a result of restocking  seasonal demand and continued public sector projects 
our mills ran at utilization during as compared to during we rolled fewer tons in as compared to to meet lagging demand 
rebar accounted for of tonnage shipped  an increase from in the price premium of merchant bar over reinforcing bar averaged per ton  up per ton from lower production rates as well as price decreases in some alloys and natural gas rates resulted in an overall decrease of million in electrode  alloys and energy costs

profits were attributable to margin improvements on lower material costs supplying relatively high priced backlog shipments as compared to which included rising prices and margin compression for our fabrication business 
as the economic conditions continued to deteriorate during  the prices and the volume associated with the backlog decreased leading to lower sales and shipments during the end of fiscal losses in post operations were caused by high priced raw material in inventory running through production and strong competition for dwindling tons in joist operations 
the composite average fabrication selling price was  per ton  up from  per ton in rebar shipments have been positively impacted by recent acquisitions of cmc coating and cmc regional steel 
our largest challenge for this segment remains in our domestic steel import and distribution business which incurred substantial losses 
the decline in spot pricing coupled with customer liquidity issues has led to unprecedented and unwarranted contract cancellations  market claims  price negotiations and unanticipated inventory positions resulting in charges of million in the tables below shows our average fabrication selling prices per short ton and total fabrication plant shipments for the year ended august increase average selling price amount rebar joist structural post deck excludes stock and buyout sales

shipments included thousand tons of billets compared to thousand tons of billets in the prior year 
we successfully rolled thousand tons of material on our newly commissioned wire rod block and we will continue to test different sizes and grades incurring additional start up costs in the first quarter of fiscal year this major strategic expansion captures the advantage of the underutilized melting capacity of cmcz s two existing electric arc furnaces

cmcs melted thousand tons  rolled thousand tons and shipped thousand tons during as compared to thousand tons melted  thousand tons rolled and thousand tons shipped during our yields have steadily improved during  and we have successfully completed castings of all major sizes of billets from phase one of our upgraded melt shop 
the installation of the renovated furnace is underway and should be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year the turnaround at cmcs is contingent on the successful completion of our capital expenditure programs for a replacement furnace  improvements to the continuous caster and increased sales as part of a market turnaround 
international fabrication and distribution this segment s net sales decreased and we incurred an adjusted operating loss during driven by reduced market demand and inventory valuation adjustments as pricing fell during offset by pre tax lifo income primarily related to a division classified as a discontinued operation 
the downturn in steel markets continues in europe while parts of asia and australia are showing signs of recovery 
the global financial crisis contributed to customer noncompliance with contracts  market claims and price renegotiations 
additionally  demand was negatively impacted as customers were not willing to be exposed to lead times for imported material in the volatile pricing environment 
this segment recorded over million in charges for inventory adjustments and customer non compliance during our raw materials import business remained profitable and we opened a fabrication facility in zyrardow  poland  located west of warsaw 

table of contents in august  cmc s board approved a plan to offer for sale a division which was involved with the buying  selling and distribution of nonferrous metals 
at august   in connection with the closure of the division  all inventory of this division had been sold or absorbed by other divisions of the company 
see note  discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements 
corporate our corporate expenses decreased million in to million primarily due to reductions in bonus and profit sharing expenses and costs incurred for the global installation of sap software which were offset by increased salary and severance expense 
discontinued operations adjusted operating profit for our division classified as a discontinued operation decreased to million from adjusted operating profit of million in the change primarily resulted from an increase in lifo income of million as compared to offset by costs incurred with ceasing operations 
consolidated data on a consolidated basis  the lifo method of inventory valuation increased our net earnings by million per diluted share for as compared to decreasing our net earnings by million diluted share for our overall selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by million for as compared to sg a expense primarily declined due to decreased bonus and profit sharing expenses and cost incurred for the global installation of sap software partially offset by increased salary expense because of company growth  including recent acquisitions  increased bad debt expense and severance expense 
our interest expense increased by million to million during as compared to primarily due to the issuance of million in senior unsecured notes in august and increased debt outstanding internationally during the current fiscal year which was offset in part by the repayment of million senior unsecured notes in february our effective tax rate for the year ended august  increased to as compared to in our effective tax rate for varies from our statutory rate due to lower tax rate jurisdictions predominately international incurring losses and higher rate jurisdictions generating income 
as of august   it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings of non us subsidiaries 
as a result  the deferred income tax liability relating to prior periods has been reversed positively impacting our effective tax rate for outlook we believe fiscal will be a year of two contrasting halves  we expect i the first half of the year will suffer the lingering effects of the down economy and the downturn during the winter season and ii the second half of the year should benefit from an improving economy and the traditional increase from the spring construction season 
domestic market conditions appear to be stabilizing  but at modest levels 
the us stimulus programs are likely to become effective in calendar year private nonresidential construction is likely to remain weak 
the asian markets are the most encouraging 
china continues to fund steel intensive projects including infrastructure  public housing and energy plans 
china may curb new steel production to control excess steel capacity 
china may increase exports of higher value steel products  but we believe this will be mainly to nearby asian markets 
we believe most markets in asia are likely to continue to improve including taiwan  vietnam and malaysia 
australia s economic recovery is ahead of the us  and we believe recovery in europe is likely to be mixed 
poland is expected to lead central eastern europe with improving gdp growth 
compared to americas recycling this segment had record sales and adjusted operating profit in which was driven by higher scrap prices  primarily ferrous 
the record adjusted operating income of million was strong enough to overcome lifo expense of million in compared to million in spurred by ferrous price increases  our ferrous scrap operations accounted for three fourths of the segment s profitability 
the average ferrous scrap sales price increased and shipments increased compared to although lower than ferrous scrap  the average sales price of nonferrous scrap increased but shipments decreased due to continued weak residential markets and lower manufacturing output

this segment had lifo expense of million  an increase of million over within the segment  adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for as compared to million for the decrease in adjusted operating profit was mainly due to additional lifo expense of million recorded during as compared to metal margins were higher as weighted average sales prices barely stayed ahead of rapidly increasing ferrous scrap prices 
the price of ferrous scrap consumed rose compared to the increase in ferrous scrap prices drove the average selling price up per ton while the average selling price for finished goods increased per ton 
margins were negatively impacted by a increase in alloys and electrodes and a increase in energy cost during as compared to combined  these two costs accounted for an increase of million

we also recorded job loss reserves of million during based on our estimate of fixed rate contracts 
the composite average selling price increased  however  the overall job mix represented by the backlog did not have sufficient time to rollover to higher prices to match the increase in steel finished goods

liquidity and capital resources see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities 
however  we could be adversely affected if our banks  the buyers of our commercial paper or other of the traditional sources supplying our short term borrowing requirements refuse to honor their contract commitments  cease lending or declare bankruptcy 
while we believe the lending institutions participating in our 
table of contents credit arrangements are financially capable  recent events in the global credit markets  including the failure  takeover or rescue by various government entities of major financial institutions  have created uncertainty of credit availability to an extent not experienced in recent decades

certain of our financing agreements include various financial covenants 
our revolving credit agreement requires compliance with certain covenants each fiscal quarter  of which we were in compliance as of august  the cmcz notes require compliance with certain covenants each february and august 
at august   cmcz was not in compliance with these covenants which resulted in a guarantee by commercial metals company becoming effective 
as a result of the guarantee  the financial covenant requirements became void  however  all other terms of the loan remain in effect  including the payment schedule 
the guarantee will cease to be effective when cmcz is in compliance with the financial covenants for two consecutive quarters 
off balance sheet arrangements for added flexibility  we may secure financing through securitization and sales of certain accounts receivable both in the us and internationally 
see note  sales of accounts receivable  to the consolidated financial statements 
we may sell accounts receivable on an ongoing basis to replace those receivables that have been collected from our customers 
our domestic securitization program contains certain cross default provisions whereby a termination event could occur should we default under another credit arrangement  and contains covenants that conform to the same requirements contained in our revolving credit agreement 
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities primarily result from sales of steel and related products  and to a lesser extent  sales of nonferrous metal products 
we also sell and rent construction related products and accessories 
we have a diverse and generally stable customer base 
we use futures or forward contracts as needed to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and metals commodity prices 
see note  financial instruments  market and credit risk  to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we generated million of net cash flows from operating activities as compared to using million in significant fluctuations in working capital were as follows decreased accounts receivable decreased sales and prices during decreased inventories decreased inventory on hand and lower inventory costs  and decreased accounts payable and accrued expenses more cash being used during as current liabilities increased at the end of as a result of higher volume 
lower volume in led to less purchasing of material and reduced accounts payable 
additionally  accrued expenses were reduced as a result of minimal amounts accrued for bonus and profit sharing during during  we used million of net cash flows from investing activities as compared to million in we had no significant acquisitions in which resulted in a decrease in cash used for acquisitions of

significant capital expenditures in related to construction of the new micro mill in arizona  the installation of a new wire rod block and rolling mill at cmcz  the melt shop and caster upgrades at cmcs and capitalization of costs associated with the global implementation of sap 
we expect our total capital spending for to be approximately million 
we continually assess our capital spending and reevaluate our requirements based on current and expected results 
net cash flows from financing activities used million for as compared to cash provided of million for the increase in cash used was primarily due to net repayments of short term borrowings and long term debt during of million as compared to net proceeds in of million from new debt issued 
during  we used million to purchase million shares of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase program  a decrease of million as compared to additionally  we decreased documentary letters of credit which resulted in a change in the use of cash of million as compared to our contractual obligations for the next twelve months of million are typically expenditures with normal revenue producing activities 
we believe our cash flows from operating activities and debt facilities are adequate to fund our ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of august  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt notes payable interest operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have not discounted the cash obligations in this table 
total amounts are included in the august  consolidated balance sheet 
see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest payments related to our short term debt are not included in the table as they do not represent a significant obligation as of august  includes minimum lease payment obligations for non cancelable equipment and real estate leases in effect as of august  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
approximately of these purchase obligations are for inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations include all enforceable  legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms  regardless of the duration of the agreement 
agreements with variable terms are excluded because we are unable to estimate the minimum amounts 
another significant obligation relates to capital expenditures 
other commercial commitments we maintain stand by letters of credit to provide support for certain transactions that our insurance providers and suppliers request 
at august   we had committed million under these arrangements 
all commitments expire within one year 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or 
table of contents judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular quarter 
environmental and other matters see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
general we are subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations in all locations where we have operating facilities 
we anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will involve continuing capital expenditures and operating costs 
our original business and one of our core businesses for over nine decades is metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  we are committed to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  may expose us and the industry to potentially significant risks 
we believe that recycled materials are commodities that are diverted by recyclers  such as us  from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease  and in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used in our operations 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of several such properties 
state and federal laws applicable to wastes and contaminated properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under new laws  we could be required to remediate properties impacted by previously disposed wastes 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp at a number of contaminated sites 
we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state and or local statutes where we operate 
these statutes  regulations and laws may have limited disposal options for certain wastes 
superfund the us environmental protection agency epa or an equivalent state agency notified us that we are considered a prp at ten sites  none owned by us 
we may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla or a similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
we are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting  or at the appropriate time we may contest  our liability at the sites 
in addition  we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
because of various factors  including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the extended time periods over which such costs may be incurred  we cannot reasonably estimate our ultimate costs of compliance with cercla 
at august   based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  we had million accrued for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with eight of the ten cercla sites 
we have accrued for these liabilities based upon our best estimates 
we are not able to reasonably estimate an amount for the two other cercla sites 
the amounts paid and the expenses incurred on these sites for the years ended august   and were not material 
historically  the amounts that we have ultimately paid for such remediation activities have not been material 

table of contents clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined  or into publicly owned treatment works 
these controls have become more stringent over time and it is probable that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future 
permits must generally be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters or into publicly owned treatment works  comparable permits may be required at the state level 
the cwa and many state agencies provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants 
in addition  the epa s regulations and comparable state regulations may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge or non compliance with permit requirements  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
clean air act our operations are subject to regulations at the federal  state and local level for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
new and modified sources of air pollutants are often required to obtain permits prior to commencing construction  modification and or operations 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent requirements  including the potential need for additional permits and to increased scrutiny in the context of enforcement 
the epa has been implementing its stationary emission control program through expanded enforcement of the new source review program 
under this program  new or modified sources may be required to construct emission sources using what is referred to as the best available control technology  or in any areas that are not meeting national ambient air quality standards  using methods that satisfy requirements for lowest achievable emission rate 
additionally  the epa is implementing new  more stringent standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
the epa recently has promulgated new national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for steel mills which will require specific sources in this category to meet the standards by reflecting application of maximum achievable control technology 
compliance with the new standards could require additional expenditures 
in  we incurred environmental expenses of million 
the expenses included the cost of environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessments  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
during  million of our capital expenditures related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
at august   million was accrued for environmental liabilities of which million was classified as other long term liabilities 
dividends we have paid quarterly cash dividends in each of the past consecutive quarters 
we paid dividends in at the rate of per share for all quarters

the following types of derivative instruments were outstanding at august   in accordance with our risk management program 
currency exchange forwards we enter into currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of international trade commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the company or its subsidiaries 
no single foreign currency poses a primary risk to us 
fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 
commodity prices we base pricing in some of our sales and purchase contracts on metal commodity futures exchange quotes which we determine at the beginning of the contract 
due to the volatility of the metal commodity indexes  we enter into metal commodity futures contracts for copper  aluminum and nickel 
these futures mitigate the risk of unanticipated declines in gross margin due to the volatility of the commodity prices on these contractual commitments 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to minimal gains and losses from ineffectiveness 
natural gas we enter into natural gas forward contracts as economic hedges of the company s americas mills operations based on anticipated consumption of natural gas in order to mitigate the risk of unanticipated increase to operating cost due to the volatility of natural gas prices 
freight we occasionally enter into freight forward contracts when sales commitments to customers include a fixed price freight component in order to minimize the effect of the volatility of ocean freight rates
