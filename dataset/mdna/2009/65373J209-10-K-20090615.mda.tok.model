item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the current economic slowdown or recession  the asset backed securities market  along with credit markets in general  have been experiencing unprecedented disruptions 
due to the tightening of the credit markets  the availability of financing for individuals with sub prime credit ratings has decreased significantly  slowing the expected rate of prepayment of contracts originated by us 
if losses on contracts continue to increase and the expected rate of prepayment decreases  our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
decreased auction proceeds resulting from the depressed prices at which used automobiles may be sold during periods of economic slowdown or recession will reduce our profitability 
if we repossess a vehicle securing a contract  we typically have it transported to an automobile auction for sale 
auction proceeds from the sale of repossessed vehicles and other recoveries are usually not sufficient to cover the outstanding balance of the contract  and the resulting deficiency is charged off 
in addition  there is  on average  approximately a day lapse between the time we repossess a vehicle and the time it is sold by a dealer or at auction 
furthermore  depressed wholesale prices for used automobiles may result from significant liquidations of rental or fleet inventories  and from increased volume of trade ins due to promotional financing programs offered by new vehicle manufacturers 
during periods of economic slowdown or recession  such as has existed for much of the past twelve months  decreased auction proceeds resulting from the depressed prices at which used automobiles may be sold will result in our experiencing higher credit losses 
an increase in market interest rates may reduce our profitability 
our long term profitability may be directly affected by the level of and fluctuations in interest rates 
sustained  significant increases in interest rates may adversely affect our liquidity and profitability by reducing the interest rate spread between the rate of interest we receive on our contracts and interest rates that we pay under our outstanding line of credit facility 
as interest rates increase  our gross interest rate spread on new originations will generally decline since the rates charged on the contracts originated or purchased from dealers generally are limited by statutory maximums  restricting our opportunity to pass on increased interest costs 
we monitor the interest rate environment and have entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to a portion of our outstanding debt with maturities ranging from october  through february  each of these agreements effectively converts a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on our interest expense 
these interest rate swap agreements may not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates  however  and we may not be able to enter into such agreements in the future 

table of contents our growth depends upon our ability to retain and attract a sufficient number of qualified employees 
to a large extent  our growth strategy depends on the opening of new offices that will focus primarily on purchasing contracts and making direct loans in markets we have not previously served 
future expansion of our office network depends  in part  upon our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced office managers and the ability of such managers to develop relationships with dealers that serve those markets 
we generally do not open new offices until we have located and hired a qualified and experienced individual to manage the office 
typically  this individual will be familiar with local market conditions and have existing relationships with dealers in the area to be served 
although we believe that we can attract and retain qualified and experienced personnel as we proceed with planned expansion into new markets  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in doing so 
competition to hire personnel possessing the skills and experience required by us could contribute to an increase in our employee turnover rate 
high turnover or an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our origination  delinquency  default and net loss rates and  ultimately  our financial condition 
the loss of one of our key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our growth and development to date have been largely dependent upon the services of peter l 
vosotas  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  and ralph t 
finkenbrink  our chief financial officer and senior vice president finance 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on these executives 
although we believe that we have sufficient additional experienced management personnel to accommodate the loss of any key executive  the loss of services of one or both of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we are subject to risks associated with litigation 
as a consumer finance company  we are subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties  based upon  among other things usury laws  disclosure inaccuracies  wrongful repossession  violations of bankruptcy stay provisions  certificate of title disputes  fraud  breach of contract  and discriminatory treatment of credit applicants 
some litigation against us could take the form of class action complaints by consumers 
as the assignee of contracts originated by dealers  we may also be named as a co defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against dealers 
the damages and penalties claimed by consumers in these types of actions can be substantial 
the relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but may include requests for compensatory  statutory and punitive damages 
no assurances can be given that we will not experience material financial losses in the future as a result of litigation and other legal proceedings 

table of contents we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations  and any material violations of or changes in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business operations 
our financing operations are subject to regulation  supervision and licensing under various federal  state and local statutes and ordinances 
additionally  the procedures that we must follow in connection with the repossession of vehicles securing contracts are regulated by each of the states in which we do business 
the various federal  state and local statutes  regulations  and ordinances applicable to our business govern  among other things licensing requirements  requirements for maintenance of proper records  payment of required fees to certain states  maximum interest rates that may be charged on loans to finance new and used vehicles  debt collection practices  proper disclosure to customers regarding financing terms  privacy regarding certain customer data  interest rates on loans to customers  telephone solicitation of direct loan customers  and collection of debts from loan customers who have filed bankruptcy 
we believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable local  state and federal regulations 
our failure  or failure by dealers who originate the contracts we purchase  to maintain all requisite licenses and permits  and to comply with other regulatory requirements  could result in consumers having rights of rescission and other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
furthermore  any changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations may make our compliance therewith more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition 
our chief executive officer and certain members of the mahan family hold a significant percentage of our common stock and may take actions adverse to your interests 
peter l 
vosotas  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  and certain members of the mahan family  including the adult children of marvin and ingrid mahan  and certain entities controlled by them  owned approximately and  respectively  of our common stock as of june  as a result  they may be able to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election and removal of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  such as mergers  consolidations and sales of assets 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation  takeover or other business combination  which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent you from receiving a premium in such transaction 

table of contents our stock is lightly traded  which may limit your ability to resell your shares 
the average daily trading volume of our shares on the nasdaq global select market for the period from april  through march  was approximately  shares 
thus  our common stock is thinly traded 
thinly traded stock can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market 
factors such as our financial results  the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors  and various factors affecting the consumer finance industry generally may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and market prices for the stocks of many companies  including ours  have experienced wide price fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to their operating performance 
therefore  our shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at the volumes  prices  or times that they desire 
we operate in a competitive market 
the non prime consumer finance industry is highly competitive 
there are numerous financial service companies that provide consumer credit in the markets served by us  including banks  credit unions  other consumer finance companies and captive finance companies owned by automobile manufacturers and retailers 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources than us 
in addition  our competitors often provide financing on terms more favorable to automobile purchasers or dealers than we offer 
many of these competitors also have long standing relationships with automobile dealerships and may offer dealerships or their customers other forms of financing  including dealer floor plan financing and leasing  which are not provided by us 
providers of non prime consumer financing have traditionally competed primarily on the basis of interest rates charged  the quality of credit accepted  the flexibility of loan terms offered  and the quality of service provided 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies offering similar financing arrangements depends on maintaining close relationships with dealers of new and used vehicles 
we may not be able to compete successfully in this market or against these competitors 
we have focused on a segment of the market composed of consumers who typically do not meet the more stringent credit requirements of traditional consumer financing sources and whose needs  as a result  have not been addressed consistently by such financing sources 
if  however  other providers of consumer financing were to assert a significantly greater effort to penetrate our targeted market segment  we may have to reduce our interest rates and fees in order to maintain our market share 
any reduction in our interest rates or fees could have an adverse impact on our profitability or financial condition 
we may experience problems with our integrated computer systems or be unable to keep pace with developments in technology 
we use various technologies in our business  including telecommunication  data processing  and integrated computer systems 
technology changes rapidly 
our ability to compete successfully with other financing companies may depend on whether we can exploit technological changes 
we may not be able to exploit technological changes  and any investment we make in this area may not make us more profitable 
we utilize integrated computer systems to respond to customer inquiries and to monitor the performance of our contract and direct loan portfolios and the performance of individual customers under our contracts and direct loans 
problems with our systems operations could adversely impact our ability to monitor our portfolios or collect amounts due under our contracts and direct loans  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

the company s consolidated net income decreased for the fiscal year ended march  to million as compared to million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the company s earnings were negatively impacted by an increase in the net charge off percentage from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the company believes the primary reason for the increase in the charge off percentage is primarily attributable to the increase in the unemployment rate 
to a lesser extent  other factors such as higher gasoline prices  adjustable rate mortgages and increases in the cost of food and other cost of living expenses has contributed to increased losses 
as discussed in note interest rate swap agreements  the company made an economic decision which resulted in undesignating the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges

table of contents critical accounting policy the company s critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for credit losses 
it is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
the allowance for credit losses is established through allocations of dealer discount and a provision for loss based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  the composition of the portfolio  specific impaired loans and current economic conditions 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  management s estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate credit loss allowance 
because of the nature of the customers under the company s contracts and its direct loan program  the company considers the establishment of adequate reserves for credit losses to be imperative 
the company segregates its contracts into static pools for purposes of establishing reserves for losses 
all contracts purchased by a branch during a fiscal quarter comprise a static pool 
the company pools contracts according to branch location because the branches purchase contracts in different geographic markets 
this method of pooling by branch and quarter allows the company to evaluate the different markets where the branches operate 
the pools also allow the company to evaluate the different levels of customer income  stability  credit history  and the types of vehicles purchased in each market 
each such static pool consists of the contracts purchased by a branch office during the fiscal quarter 
contracts are purchased from many different dealers and are all purchased on an individual contract by contract basis 
individual contract pricing is determined by the automobile dealerships and is generally the lesser of state maximum interest rates or the maximum interest rate at which the customer will accept 
in certain markets  competitive forces will drive down contract rates from the maximum rate to a level where an individual competitor is willing to buy an individual contract 
the company only buys contracts on an individual basis and never purchases contracts in batches  although the company may consider portfolio acquisitions as part of its growth strategy 
the company has detailed underwriting guidelines it utilizes to determine which contracts to purchase 
these guidelines are specific and are designed to cause all of the contracts that the company purchases to have common risk characteristics 
the company utilizes its district managers to evaluate their respective branch locations for adherence to these underwriting guidelines 
the company also utilizes an internal audit department to assure adherence to its underwriting guidelines 
the company utilizes the branch model  which allows for contract purchasing to be done on the branch level 
each branch manager may interpret the guidelines differently  and as a result  the common risk characteristics tend to be the same on an individual branch level but not necessarily compared to another branch 
a dealer discount represents the difference between the finance receivable  net of unearned interest  of a contract  and the amount of money the company actually pays for the contract 
the discount negotiated by the company is a function of the credit quality of the customer and the wholesale value of the vehicle 
the automotive dealer accepts these terms by executing a dealer agreement with the company 
the entire amount of discount is related to credit quality and is considered to be part of the credit loss reserve 
the company utilizes a static pool approach to track portfolio performance 
a static pool retains an amount equal to of the discount as a reserve for credit losses 
subsequent to the purchase  if the reserve for credit losses is determined to be inadequate for a static pool which is not fully liquidated  then an additional charge to income through the provision is used to reestablish adequate reserves 
if a static pool is fully liquidated and has any remaining reserves  the excess discounts are immediately recognized into income and the excess provision is immediately reversed during the period 
for static pools not fully liquidated that are determined to have excess discounts  such excess amounts are accreted into income over the remaining life of the static pool 
for static pools not fully liquidated that are deemed to have excess reserves  such excess amounts are reversed against provision for credit losses during the period 

table of contents in analyzing a static pool  the company considers the performance of prior static pools originated by the branch office  the performance of prior contracts purchased from the dealers whose contracts are included in the current static pool  the credit rating of the customers under the contracts in the static pool  and current market and economic conditions 
each static pool is analyzed monthly to determine if the loss reserves are adequate and adjustments are made if they are determined to be necessary

the gross portfolio yield decreased from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  the net portfolio yield decreased from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  the gross portfolio yield decreased due to a combination of a change to reflect interest earned on a contractual basis  as opposed to on the basis of expected yield see discussion under analysis of credit losses below  a decrease in accretion of discounts due to deterioration in portfolio performance  and lower weighted apr on contracts purchased during fiscal year the net portfolio yield decreased due to the above factors  net of additional provisions for credit losses required for the change in the recognition of interest and the resulting affect on credit loss provisions 
marketing  salaries  employee benefits  depreciation  and administrative expenses marketing  salaries  employee benefits  depreciation  and administrative expenses increased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase of was primarily attributable to additional staffing at several existing branches and increased administrative expenses driven by increased repossession and collection related expenses

table of contents analysis of credit losses as of march   the company had active static pools 
the average pool upon inception consisted of contracts with aggregate finance receivables  net of unearned interest  of approximately the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the changes in the allowance for credit losses on contracts for the years ended march balance at beginning of year discounts acquired on new volume current year provision losses absorbed recoveries discounts accreted balance at end of year the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the changes in the allowance for credit losses on direct loans for the years ended march balance at beginning of year current year provision losses absorbed recoveries balance at end of year reserves accreted into income for the fiscal year ended march  were approximately  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  provisions reversed for the fiscal years ended march  and were  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease in reserves accreted during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  was an increase in the net charge off percentage from to 
the primary reason for reversal of provisions previously recorded was due to the charge off performance of static pools originated from april through december these specific pools were originated  and the majority of their liquidation occurred  during more prosperous economic times 
as a result  their accompanying charge off rate was lower than those of static pools originated during subsequent years 
the average dealer discount associated with new volume for the fiscal years ended march  and was and  respectively 
the provision for credit losses increased from million for the year ended march  to million for the fiscal year ended march   largely due to the increase in the net charge off rate from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  the company s losses as a percentage of liquidation increased from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  the longer term outlook for portfolio performance will depend on the overall economic conditions  the unemployment rate and the company s ability to monitor  manage and implement its underwriting philosophy in additional geographic areas as it strives to continue its expansion 
the company does not believe there have been any significant changes in loan concentrations  or the terms or quality of contracts purchased during fiscal that would have contributed to the increase in losses 

table of contents recoveries as a percentage of charge offs were and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the company believes that as it continues to expand its operations  it will become more difficult to implement its loss recovery model in geographic areas further away from its corporate headquarters  and as a result the company will likely experience declining recovery rates over the long term 
recovery rates are also influenced by general economic conditions and  as a result  the company experienced recovery rates for the fiscal year ended march  that were below historical averages 
the company considers the following factors to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels unemployment rates  the number of bankruptcy filings  the results of internal branch audits  consumer sentiment  consumer spending  economic growth ie  changes in gdp  the condition of the housing sector  and other leading economic indicators 
as a result of weakness in the overall economy  the company has increased its targeted reserve levels on static pools originated since september  and the company continues to re evaluate reserve levels on a pool by pool basis during each reporting period 
the delinquency percentage for contracts more than thirty days past due as of march  increased to from as of march  the delinquency percentage for direct loans more than thirty days past due as of march  increased to from as of march  the company utilizes a static pool approach to analyzing portfolio performance and looks at specific static pool performance and recent trends as leading indicators to future performance of the portfolio 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year primarily as a result of lower pretax income 
the company s effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal interest and fee income on finance receivables interest income on finance receivables  predominantly finance charge income  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the average finance receivables  net of unearned interest  totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of from million for the fiscal year ended march  the primary reason average finance receivables  net of unearned interest increased was the increase in the receivable base of several existing branches and the development of two new markets in tennessee 
the gross finance receivable balance increased to million at march  from million at march  the primary reason interest income increased was the increase in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the gross portfolio yield decreased from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  the net portfolio yield decreased from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  the gross portfolio yield decreased due to a combination of a change to reflect interest earned on a contractual basis  as opposed to on the basis of expected yield see discussion under analysis of credit losses below  together with decreases in accretion of discounts due to deterioration in portfolio performance

marketing  salaries  employee benefits  depreciation  and administrative expenses marketing  salaries  employee benefits  depreciation and administrative expenses increased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase of was primarily attributable to the additional staffing at several existing branches and increased general operating expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of average finance receivables  net of unearned interest  decreased from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  
table of contents interest expense interest expense increased from million for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  the average indebtedness for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  the average cost of borrowed funds increased from during the fiscal year ended march  to during the fiscal year ended march  analysis of credit losses as of march   the company had active static pools 
the average pool upon inception consisted of contracts with aggregate finance receivables  net of unearned interest  of approximately prior to april   in situations where  at the date of purchase  the dealer discount was determined to be insufficient to absorb all potential credit losses associated with a static pool  a portion of unearned income associated with the static pool was allocated to the reserve for dealer discounts 
for loans purchased prior to april  the company recognized revenue on the basis of interest expected to be collected  which was the gross contractual interest less amounts allocated to the reserve for dealer discounts 
effective with loans purchased after march   the company discontinued the practice of allocating a portion of unearned income to the reserve for dealer discounts 
this change was made to reflect the predominate practice in the industry and improve comparability with other companies within the finance industry 
effective with loans purchased after march  the company began recognizing interest income based upon the contractual rate of the loan 
in situations where the discount is determined to be insufficient to absorb all potential losses associated with the static pool  a charge to income is provided into provision for credit losses over the remaining life of the pool 
the change in the practice of allocating a portion of the unearned income to reserves for dealer discounts did not have a significant effect on the periodic net operating results  but rather resulted in differences in the classification of amounts within the statement of income 
both interest income and provisions for credit losses were higher for those pools acquired during the fiscal year ended march  than those pools acquired prior to such period 
in addition  while this change has not significantly changed the net finance receivables as reported  the components of net finance receivables have changed as unearned interest as a percentage of gross contracts has increased as a result of the change and will be followed in subsequent periods by increases in the allowance for credit losses 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the changes in the allowance for credit losses on contracts for the years ended march balance at beginning of year discounts acquired on new volume current year provision losses absorbed recoveries discounts accreted balance at end of year 
table of contents the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the changes in the allowance for credit losses on direct loans for the years ended march balance at beginning of year current year provision losses absorbed recoveries balance at end of year reserves accreted into income for the fiscal year ended march  were approximately million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  provisions reversed for the fiscal years ended march  and were  and million  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease in reserves accreted during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  was an increase in the net charge off percentage from to 
the primary reason for reversal of provisions previously recorded was due to the charge off performance of static pools originated from april through december the average dealer discount associated with new volume for the fiscal years ended march  and was and  respectively 
the provision for credit losses increased from million for the fiscal year ended march  to million for the fiscal year ended march   largely due to the increase in the net charge off rate from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  the company s losses as a percentage of liquidation increased from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  the longer term outlook for portfolio performance will depend on the overall economic conditions  the unemployment rate and the company s ability to monitor  manage and implement its underwriting philosophy in additional geographic areas as it strives to continue its expansion 
the company does not believe there were any significant changes in loan concentrations  or terms or quality of contracts purchased during fiscal that would have contributed to the increase in losses 
recoveries as a percentage of charge offs were and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the company believes that as it continues to expand its operations  it will become more difficult to implement its loss recovery model in geographic areas further away from its corporate headquarters and  as a result  the company will likely experience declining recovery rates over the long term 
recovery rates are also influenced by general economic conditions and  as a result  the company experienced recovery rates for the fiscal year ended march  that were below historical averages 
the company considers the following factors to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels unemployment rates  the number of bankruptcy filings  the results of internal branch audits  consumer sentiment  consumer spending  economic growth ie  changes in gdp  the condition of the housing sector  and other leading economic indicators 
as a result of weakness in the overall economy  the company has increased its targeted reserve levels on static pools originated since september  and the company continues to re evaluate reserve levels on a pool by pool basis during each reporting period 
the delinquency percentage for contracts more than thirty days past due as of march  increased to from as of march  the delinquency percentage for direct loans more than thirty days past due as of march  increased to from as of march  the company utilizes a static pool approach to analyzing portfolio performance and looks at specific static pool performance and recent trends as leading indicators to future performance of the portfolio 

table of contents income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year primarily as a result of lower pretax income 
the company s effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows are summarized as follows fiscal year ended march  cash provided by used in operations investing activities primarily purchase of contracts financing activities net decrease increase in cash the company s primary use of working capital during the fiscal year ended march  was the funding of the purchase of contracts 
the contracts were financed substantially through borrowings under the company s million line 
the line is secured by all of the assets of nicholas financial 
the company may borrow the lesser of million or amounts based upon formulas principally related to a percentage of eligible finance receivables  as defined 
borrowings under the line may be under various libor pricing options or at the prime rate 
prime rate based borrowings are generally less than million 
as of march   the amount outstanding under the line was approximately million and the amount available under the line was approximately million 
the company will continue to depend on the availability of the line  together with cash from operations  to finance future operations 
amounts outstanding under the line have increased by approximately million and million during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the growth of the line is principally related to funding the purchase of contracts and is consistent with the growth of finance receivables 
the self liquidating nature of contracts and other loans enables the company to assume a higher debt to equity ratio than in most businesses 
the amount of debt the company incurs from time to time under these financing mechanisms depends on the company s need for cash and ability to borrow under the terms of the line 
the company believes that borrowings available under the line as well as cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short term funding needs 
during  the company contemplated executing an amendment to the line  which would have increased the size of the line and extended the maturity date 
however  as us and global market and economic conditions continue to be disrupted and volatile  particularly in the financial sector  the company has elected not to amend its line at this time 
the primary reasons are the uncertainty of demand for the company s contract procurement program and the increased pricing associated with increasing the size of the line and extending the maturity date 
continued disruption in us and global markets could adversely affect the company s ability to increase the size of the line and extend the maturity date or refinance indebtedness 
any new or renewed credit facility may be under terms that are not as favorable as the current credit facility 
the company s inability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all  would limit our ability to grow and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business 

table of contents the line requires compliance with certain debt covenants including financial ratios  asset quality and other performance tests 
the company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants but  during the current economic slowdown  a breach of one or more of these covenants could occur prior to the maturity date of the line  which is november  the company s consortium of lenders could place the company in default if certain covenants were breached and take one or more of the following actions increase our borrowing costs  restrict the company s ability to obtain additional borrowings under the line  accelerate all amounts outstanding under the line  or enforce its interests against collateral securing the line 
the company believes its lenders will continue to allow it to operate in the event of a condition of default  however no assurance can be given that this would occur 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements  each of which effectively converts a portion of the company s floating rate debt to a fixed rate  thus reducing the impact of interest rate change on the company s interest expense 
at march   approximately of the company s borrowings under the line were subject to interest rate swap agreements 
these swap agreements have maturities ranging from october  through february  impact of inflation the company is affected by inflation primarily through increased operating costs and expenses including increases in interest rates 
inflationary pressures on operating costs and expenses have been offset by the company s continued emphasis on stringent operating and cost controls 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s material obligations as of march  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases line of credit total
