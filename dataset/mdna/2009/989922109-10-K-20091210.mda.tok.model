item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we intend for this discussion and analysis to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of september  and for the year then ended and the notes accompanying those consolidated financial statements 
executive overview we are committed to developing technologies that help advance emergency care and save lives  while increasing clinical and operational efficiencies 
with products for defibrillation and monitoring  circulation and 
table of contents cpr feedback  data management  fluid resuscitation  and therapeutic temperature management  we provide a comprehensive set of technologies which help clinicians  ems and fire professionals  and lay rescuers treat victims needing resuscitation and critical care 
we ended fiscal with approximately million of cash and investments and no long term debt 
we completed fiscal with revenues of approximately million 
revenue results reflected a negative foreign exchange impact of nearly million compared to fiscal while fiscal was a challenging year for us in the capital equipment business  we did see fourth quarter order growth as evidenced by our growth in backlog 
backlog more than doubled as compared to a year ago 
our lifevest revenue grew in fiscal compared to fiscal as we continue to invest in this product 
our newly acquired temperature management business contributed approximately million of revenue for fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales our net sales decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
net sales by customer product categories in fiscal and were as follows s omitted change devices and accessories to the hospital market north america devices  accessories  and data management software to the pre hospital market north america other products to north america subtotal north america all products to the international market total sales our sales to the north american hospital market decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe this decrease was primarily due to the general economic downturn and the uncertainty of healthcare reform legislation which resulted in curtailed spending by hospitals 
we continue to believe that since our professional defibrillator products are a standard of care and the installed base of defibrillators continues to age  such spending has merely been delayed rather than lost 
our sales to the north american pre hospital market increased million  or  in fiscal the increase in pre hospital sales was primarily due to increased volume of the lifevest product of approximately million and a modest increased volume of data management software products  which were partially offset by decreased sales of aeds of approximately million and professional defibrillators of approximately million 
international sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on sales by our international subsidiaries  excluding canada  totaled approximately million 
the constant currency growth was attributable primarily to international sales of our newly acquired temperature management product and increased volume of aeds 
the increased volume of sales was driven primarily by sales growth in france  the uk and asia pacific 
total sales of the autopulse product to all of our markets decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to million for fiscal we believe this reflected the current difficult economic environment and the constraints on capital spending by hospitals and ems agencies 

table of contents total sales of the lifevest product increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross margins cost of sales consists primarily of material  labor  overhead  and freight associated with the manufacturing of our various medical equipment devices  data collection software and disposables 
these products are primarily sold to the hospital  pre hospital  and international markets 
we sell the lifevest product and our data collection software mainly to the pre hospital market 
overall  gross margins for fiscal decreased to approximately compared to in fiscal approximately one and a half percentage points of the decrease was attributable to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates 
other factors affecting the fluctuation in gross margin each individually represented less than one percentage point of our overall gross margin  including the lifevest business which contributed an increase to the overall gross margin of approximately a half of a percentage point 
our gross margin tends to fluctuate from period to period as a result of unit volume levels  mix of product and customer class  geographical mix  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and overall market conditions 
backlog we ended fiscal with a backlog of approximately million  compared to approximately million at the end of the prior quarter 
backlog was approximately million at september  typically  our backlog decreases during the first and second quarters  remains relatively flat during the third quarter  and increases during the fourth quarter due to the purchasing practices of our customers 
due to possible changes in delivery schedules  cancellation of orders and delays in shipments  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily an accurate predictor of revenue for any succeeding period 
costs and expenses operating expenses in fiscal and were as follows s omitted of sales of sales change selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total expenses as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses for fiscal increased approximately as compared to fiscal this increase  as a percentage of sales  was due to slower than planned revenue growth because of the challenging economic environment and due to continued investment in new businesses  such as the lifevest and temperature management 
the dollar spending for selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to the same period last year 
the dollar spending increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to approximately million related to increased personnel related costs  including salaries  commissions and stock based compensation for selling and marketing employees  primarily for the lifevest business 
an additional increase of approximately million was due to the newly acquired temperature management business purchased from alsius in may these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our foreign subsidiary operating expenses 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased approximately of sales as compared to fiscal the increase  as a percentage of sales  was due to lower than expected revenue growth due to the challenging economic environment in fiscal  as well as supporting the continued 
table of contents investment in the lifevest and temperature management businesses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to the previous year 
the increase in dollar spending was primarily attributable to increased personnel related costs including salaries and stock based compensation for general and administrative employees  primarily related to the growth of lifevest and temperature management businesses 
as a percentage sales  research and development expenses increased approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase  as a percentage of sales  was primarily due to the lower than expected revenue growth due to the challenging economic environment in fiscal  as well as increased personnel related expenses as a result of our strategic alliance with welch allyn  the acquisition of alsius temperature management business and clinical trial work related to the autopulse and lifevest products 
research and development expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to fiscal approximately million of the dollar increase was a result of hiring additional research and development personnel in connection with our strategic alliance with welch allyn 
other contributors include increased expenses related to the acquisition of alsius of approximately million and increased clinical trial work of approximately  related to the autopulse and lifevest 
investment and other income expense investment and other income expense increased to million in fiscal  as compared to  in the previous fiscal year 
this increase primarily reflected foreign exchange gains on marking our foreign denominated intercompany receivable balances to the spot rate at the end of the year 
income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to compared to in fiscal the decreased rate resulted from a discrete benefit provided by the research and development tax credit being applied to expected annual earnings 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  congress extended the research and development tax credit which allowed us to record seven quarters worth of credits in fiscal versus only one quarter of credits in fiscal on october   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
codified within fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes overall  as a result of this adoption  we recognized approximately  of increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
at september   we had million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  all of which  if recognized  would affect our effective tax rate compared to million at september  which  if recognized  would have impacted our effective tax rate or goodwill 
we are subject to us federal income tax as well as the income tax of multiple states and foreign jurisdictions 
we have concluded all us federal and most state and foreign income tax matters through fiscal our tax return covering fiscal is currently being audited by the irs 
to date  no adjustments have been proposed 
the acquired losses from revivant for tax years through remain open to examination by the irs to the extent losses are claimed in open years 
our historical practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
we had  and  accrued for interest and penalties  at september  and september   respectively 
we currently estimate that our fiscal effective tax rate will be approximately 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales our net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net sales by customer product categories were as follows s omitted change devices and accessories to the hospital market north america devices  accessories  and data management software to the pre hospital market north america other products to north america subtotal north america all products to the international market total sales our sales to the north american hospital market increased million  or  in compared to the increase of sales to the north american hospital market was primarily due to increased volume of us military sales of approximately million  and increased volume of our professional defibrillator products to other customers of approximately million  including the m series and r series products 
the remaining increase of approximately million was due to the volume of aed sales to the north american hospital market 
our sales to the north american pre hospital market increased million  or  in compared to the increase in pre hospital sales was due to increased volume of the lifevest product of approximately million  increased volume of professional defibrillators of approximately million  data management software products of approximately million and  to a lesser extent  increased volume of aeds and autopulse products 
international sales increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in international sales was driven by increased volume of professional defibrillator sales of million 
this growth was primarily a function of the continued success of our m series product  as our newer platforms build momentum 
other contributors to the increase included increased volume of aeds of approximately million  and increased volume of autopulse 
included in these increases are approximately million of benefit from foreign exchange fluctuations 
geographical areas where sales experienced significant growth included latin america and eastern europe  both with growth of approximately million  and china  france and germany  each with growth of approximately million 
foreign exchange rates had become more volatile in fiscal compared to the sudden strengthening of the us dollar potentially impacts us in two ways 
for sales to international distributors which are denominated in us dollars  our goods may appear more expensive 
our foreign subsidiary sales which are denominated in local currency may translate into fewer us dollar revenues 
although it is difficult to predict how foreign exchange rates will fluctuate prospectively  the sudden volatility of the us dollar can have a significantly greater impact on future results than it has historically 
total sales of the autopulse product to all our markets increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to million for fiscal 
table of contents gross margins overall  gross margins for fiscal decreased to approximately compared to in fiscal a low margin california order  which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal  accounted for approximately percentage point of the decrease in gross margin 
to a lesser extent  the margin was also unfavorably affected by increased international sales  which carry lower than average margins 
offsetting the decrease in the overall gross margin was the favorable effect of the lifevest product  which carries higher than average margin 
other than the impact of the california order  each of the remaining factors causing the fluctuation in gross margin represents less than a percentage point of our overall gross margin 
backlog we ended fiscal with a backlog of approximately million 
all of this backlog shipped in fiscal due to possible changes in delivery schedules  cancellation of orders and delays in shipments  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily an accurate predictor of revenue for any succeeding period 
costs and expenses operating expenses were as follows s omitted of sales of sales change selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total expenses selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to the previous year 
approximately million of the increase related to increased personnel related costs  including salaries  commissions and stock based compensation for selling and marketing employees 
the remaining increase primarily relates to increases in selling and marketing personnel travel and tradeshow expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues as we have been able to achieve greater efficiency with our sales organization and marketing efforts as our revenue has grown 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to the previous year 
approximately million of the increase related to increased personnel related costs including salaries and stock based compensation for general and administrative employees 
research and development expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to fiscal approximately million of the increase related to increased personnel related costs including salaries and stock based compensation for research and development employees 
other contributors include increased clinical trial work related to the autopulse and lifevest 
investment and other income expense investment and other income expense decreased to  in fiscal  as compared to million in the previous year 
this decrease reflected foreign exchange losses on marking our foreign denominated intercompany receivable balances to the spot rate at the end of the year  lower average interest rates and a  reserve on certain investments in mortgage backed and auction rate securities 
income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to compared to in fiscal the decreased rate resulted from an increase in the section deduction production deduction benefit from in fiscal to 
table of contents in fiscal along with a decision made in the fourth quarter of fiscal not to provide us taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
these benefits were partially offset by the expiration of a research and development credit at december   allowing only one quarter of benefit in fiscal subsequent to the end of fiscal  congress had extended the research and development credit through december  the benefit from this congressional action was recognized in fiscal financial condition liquidity and capital resources we believe our overall financial condition remains strong 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities at september  totaled million compared with million at september  we continue to have no long term debt 
on may   we purchased substantially all of the assets of the intravascular temperature management business of alsius corporation for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
as we have previously stated  we have used cash  and it is possible we will use additional cash  to assist customers who transition to our products with various financing arrangements 
we also may use cash to assist creditworthy customers with various financing arrangements as a result of the current difficult liquidity and credit environment 
cash requirements we believe that the combination of existing cash  cash equivalents  and highly liquid short term investments  together with future cash to be generated by operations and amounts available under our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
we believe we have  and will maintain  sufficient cash to meet future contingency payments related to the lifecor and infusion dynamics acquisitions payments to lifecor may be made in cash or our common stock at our option 
we may also need to use these funds in the future for potential acquisitions 
sources and uses of cash to assist with the discussion  the following table presents the abbreviated cash flows for the years ended september   september   and september  s omitted net income changes not affecting cash changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities cash used for investing activities cash provided by financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents beginning of period cash and cash equivalents end of period operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased approximately million in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal this decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents this decrease was substantially offset by increased cash provided by accounts receivable of approximately million from fiscal to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  by increased charges not affecting cash 
investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased approximately million in fiscal to million as compared to million in the prior year 
this decrease in the use of cash was primarily attributable to the increase in cash provided by net sales of marketable securities from fiscal to fiscal of approximately million 
this decrease in investing activities was partially offset by the acquisition of substantially all the assets of alsius and the acquisition of certain assets from welch allyn in fiscal  the combined purchase prices for which were an aggregate of approximately million 
additionally  the purchase of property and equipment additions increased by approximately million in fiscal  further offsetting the overall decrease in investing activities 
property and equipment additions for fiscal totaled approximately million  and we currently anticipate additions for fiscal to be similar to fiscal financing activities cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for fiscal in comparison to approximately million in the previous year 
the change reflects a lower number of stock options exercised during approximately  shares in and  shares in 
similarly  the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options decreased from million in the previous year to  for fiscal  due to the lower number of stock options exercised during investments in march  we acquired substantially all the assets of infusion dynamics 
under the terms of the acquisition  we are obligated to make additional earn out payments through contingencies based on performance of the acquired business 
because additional consideration is based on the growth of sales  a reasonable estimate of the future payments to be made cannot be determined 
as these contingencies are resolved and the consideration is distributable  we record the fair value of the additional consideration as additional cost of the acquired assets 
our earn out payments  in the form of cash  for fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively 
we have accrued  but not yet paid  an earn out for fiscal of approximately  which is expected to be paid in cash during the first half of fiscal we exercised our option to acquire the business and assets of lifecor and acquired the business and assets on april  we assumed lifecor s outstanding debt plus an additional million owed to us  which was cancelled and certain stated liabilities 
we paid the third party debt in april we agreed to pay additional consideration in the form of earn out payments to lifecor based upon future revenue growth of the acquired business over a five year period 
earn out payments to lifecor were made in the form of cash for fiscal and fiscal in the approximate amounts of million and million  respectively 
for both annual earn outs  the additional consideration was accrued during the fiscal period when earned and paid out in the subsequent fiscal period 
we have accrued  but not yet paid  an earn out for fiscal of approximately million  which is expected to be paid during the first half of fiscal in the form of cash and or our common stock 
because additional consideration will be based on the growth of sales  a reasonable estimate of the total acquisition cost cannot be determined 
in october  we announced a strategic alliance with welch allyn involving research and development  manufacturing  sales  service  and distribution related to welch allyn s defibrillator and monitoring products 
we paid approximately million for the purchase of assets  which consist primarily of purchased software  inventory and fixed assets  related to the welch allyn defibrillator products 
on may   we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of the intravascular temperature management business of alsius 
the assets acquired include intellectual property relating to the business  other 
table of contents intangibles  inventories and fixed assets 
we assumed warranty and service contract obligations relating to alsius installed base of products 
we consolidated the operations of the acquired business into our sunnyvale  california subsidiary  zoll circulation  inc we believe that the acquisition of the temperature management technology and products from alsius  in combination with the technology and know how we acquired previously through the purchase of assets from radiant medical  inc in  creates the opportunity for us to become a major participant in the temperature management business 
no voting interest was acquired in the acquisition 
under the terms of the acquisition  we paid approximately million in cash to alsius 
debt instruments and related covenants we maintain an unsecured working capital line of credit with our bank 
under this working capital line  we may borrow  on a demand basis  up to million 
this line of credit bears interest at the rate of libor plus 
no borrowings were outstanding on this line during fiscal there are no covenants related to this line of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements our only off balance sheet arrangements consist of non cancelable operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and one minimum purchase commitment contract for a critical raw material component 
the table below in the next section titled contractual obligations and other commercial commitments shows the amounts of our operating lease commitments and purchase commitments payable by year 
for liquidity purposes  in general  we choose to lease our facilities instead of purchasing them 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations in s total less than year years years after years non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the company leases certain office and manufacturing space under operating leases 
the company s office leases are subject to adjustments based on actual floor space occupied 
the leases also require payment of real estate taxes and operating costs 
in addition to the office leases  the company leases automobiles for business use by a portion of the sales force 
the company s executive headquarters and defibrillator and fluid resuscitation manufacturing operations are located in chelmsford  massachusetts 
the chelmsford facility is covered by an eight year lease  beginning july  and expiring on june  the agreement does not contain a renewal period and provides that the company pay a pro rata amount of the landlord s real estate tax and operating expenses based upon square footage 
the lease also provided the company with an allowance of approximately million for any construction costs associated with their relocation efforts to the leased facility 
this reimbursement has been recorded as a deferred lease incentive within accrued expenses and other liabilities and is being amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the life of the lease 
any leasehold improvements made as part of the relocation have been capitalized as leasehold improvements within property and equipment and are being amortized over the eight year life of the lease 
purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts that are non cancelable 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 

table of contents purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based upon our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon future performance and growth of sales are not included in the table above 
these include the additional earn out payments for the assets of infusion dynamics and lifecor through fiscal because all of these earn out payments are based upon the growth of sales over several years  a reasonable estimate of the future payment obligations cannot be determined 
hedging activities we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding at september  in the notional amount of approximately million euros  serving to mitigate the foreign currency risk of a substantial portion of our euro denominated intercompany balances 
the net settlement amount of this contract on september   is an unrealized gain of approximately  which is included in earnings within investment and other income  net 
we had net realized gains losses of million   and  from foreign currency forward contracts during fiscal  and  respectively  which are included in earnings within investment and other income  net 
as of september   we did not have any contracts outstanding to serve as a hedge of our forecasted sales to our foreign subsidiaries 
as of september   we had contracts outstanding totaling million to serve as a hedge of our forecasted sales to our foreign subsidiaries  all maturing in less than twelve months 
because these derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  we entered into offsetting derivatives  totaling million 
all of the contracts were marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings 
at september   the net settlement amount on these contracts was an unrealized loss of approximately  net realized losses were approximately   and  during fiscal  and  respectively  and were recorded in investment and other income  net in the consolidated statements of income 
critical accounting estimates our management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner  even though in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these principles require us to make certain estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and to make difficult and subjective judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  and our most critical accounting estimates include accounts receivable reserves  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  and the valuation of long lived assets 
management continually reviews its accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies  which include revenue recognition and those that require significant estimates and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions  conditions  and methods of application in preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of cardiac resuscitation and temperature management therapy devices  disposable electrodes  catheters and accessories are recognized when a signed non cancelable purchase order exists  the product is shipped  title and risk have passed to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is 
table of contents considered probable 
circumstances that generally preclude the immediate recognition of revenue include shipping terms of fob destination or the existence of a customer acceptance clause in a contract based upon customer inspection of the product 
in these instances  revenue is deferred until adequate documentation is obtained to ensure that these criteria have been fulfilled 
similarly  revenues from the sales of our products to distributors fall under the same guidelines 
for all significant orders placed by our distributors  we require an approved purchase order  we perform a credit review  and we ensure that the terms on the purchase order or contract are proper and do not include any contingencies which preclude revenue recognition 
we do not typically offer any special right of return  stock rotation or price protection to our distributors or end customers 
for sales in which payment extends beyond a twelve month period  we recognize revenue at its net present value using an imputed rate of interest based on our experience of successful collection on these terms without concession 
our sales to customers often include a device  disposables and other accessories 
for the vast majority of our shipments  all deliverables are shipped together 
in cases where some elements of a multiple element arrangement are not delivered as of a reporting date and we have established fair value for the undelivered elements  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements and only recognize the revenue related to the delivered elements in accordance with fasb asc  multiple element arrangements formerly emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns 
some sales to customers of our cardiac resuscitation devices may include some data collection software 
the cardiac resuscitation device and software product can operate independently of each other and one does not affect the functionality of the other 
in cases where both elements are included in a customer s order but only one has been delivered by the reporting date  we defer the fair value of the undelivered element and recognize the revenue related to the delivered item in accordance with fasb asc  software revenue recognition formerly eitf and fasb asc  multiple element arrangements 
we also license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including training  installation  consulting and maintenance  which consists of product support services  and unspecified upgrade rights collectively  post contract customer support  pcs 
revenue from the sale of software is recognized in accordance with fasb asc  software revenue recognition formerly sop 
license fee revenues are recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
revenues from maintenance agreements and upgrade rights are recognized ratably over the period of service 
revenue for services  such as software deployment and consulting  is recognized when the service is performed 
our software arrangements contain multiple elements  which include software products  services and pcs 
generally  we do not sell computer hardware products with our software products 
we will occasionally facilitate the hardware purchase by providing information to the customer such as where to purchase the equipment 
we generally do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our software products 
we do  however  have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for items such as consulting and technical services  deployment and pcs based upon the price charged when such items are sold separately 
accordingly  for transactions where vendor specific objective evidence exists for undelivered elements but not for delivered elements  we use the residual method 
under the residual method  the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence  is deferred and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we do not typically ship any of our software products to distributors or resellers 
our software products are sold by our sales force directly to the end user 
we may sell software to system integrators who provide complete solutions to end users on a contract basis 
in fiscal  we were awarded a contract of approximately million with a contractor hired by the state of california to supply defibrillators and accessories 
the contract also includes preventative maintenance 
table of contents and storage services for certain defibrillators and accessories over a five year period 
based on the award  we shipped the defibrillators and accessories equipment in three installments over the course of four months beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and ending in the first quarter of fiscal at the request of the state  the equipment was shipped to three warehouse locations within california in order to provide for rapid deployment in the case of an emergency 
two of the warehouses are facilities leased by us 
due to the life support function of the equipment and the requirement that they be deployed at a moment s notice to sustain life in the event of an emergency  it is important that they are stored in an appropriate condition and location 
as a result  the state requested that we make arrangements to store and maintain certain of the equipment to ensure that it performs its life support function when deployed 
individuals with the requisite background  skills and credentials store and maintain the products 
the preventative maintenance services include preventative maintenance on the defibrillator units as well as battery and electrode replacement upon expiration of their shelf life within the five year period of the contract 
although we delivered the first two installments of the equipment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended september   no revenue was recognized since objective and reliable evidence of fair value did not exist for all undelivered elements 
we recognized revenue related to the delivered equipment in the first quarter of fiscal as we determined that objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for all remaining undelivered elements  including maintenance  storage  insurance and accessories 
we recognized approximately million of revenue during the first quarter of fiscal the remaining amount of consideration is being recognized over a five year period as the undelivered elements are delivered 
in fiscal  we recognized approximately million of this revenue  and at september   we had approximately million in deferred revenue remaining related to this contract 
in fiscal  we began performance under a state of readiness contract awarded by the us government to supply defibrillators on short notice 
based on the award  we received two types of payments from the us government 
the first payment of approximately million was to reimburse us for the cost to acquire inventories required to meet potentially short notice delivery schedules 
this payment was carried within deferred revenue on our balance sheet as a liability under government contract 
we also received a payment from the us government to compensate us for managing the purchase  build  storage and inventory rotation process 
this payment also compensated us for making future production capacity available 
the portion of this payment associated with the purchase and build aspects of the contract was recognized on a percentage of completion basis while the portion of the payment for the storage  inventory rotation and facilities charge was recognized ratably over the contract period 
this government contract was for a one year term  and the us government subsequently exercised four one year extension options 
these fees were for the storage  inventory rotation and facilities charge and were recognized ratably over the contract period 
on september   this government contract expired 
upon expiration  title to certain units as defined in the contract transferred to the us government  and the corresponding cost of goods sold was recognized 
all future obligations  excluding normal warranty  under this contract ceased 
consequently  we recognized the million amount previously carried on the balance sheet in deferred revenue as revenue 
on september   we entered into another state of readiness contract with similar terms for a one year term with four one year extensions 
during fiscal  we anticipate receiving the first payment of approximately million which amount will be carried within deferred revenue on our balance sheet as a liability under government contracts 
similar to the previous contract  the us government has two options to acquire defibrillators under the new contract 
they may buy on a replenishment basis  which means we will record a sale under our normal us government price list and maintain our state of readiness  or they may buy on a non replenishment basis  which will allow us to obtain normal margins but will reduce our future obligations under this arrangement 

table of contents for those markets for which we sell separately priced extended warranties  revenue is deferred and recognized over the applicable warranty period  based upon the fair value of the contract 
we also generate rental revenue from our lifevest product 
doctors prescribe the lifevest equipment for use by their patients 
the patients then rent the lifevest product for use over a prescribed period of time  typically between to months 
the patients are generally covered by health plan contracts  which typically contract with a third party payor that agrees to pay based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates 
third party payors are entities such as insurance companies  governmental agencies  health maintenance organizations or other managed care providers 
the rental income is recognized ratably over the rental period 
allowance for doubtful accounts sales returns and allowances trade in allowances we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses  for which related provisions are included in bad debt expense  resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
specifically identified reserves are charged to selling and marketing expenses 
provisions for general reserves are charged to general and administrative expenses 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the aging of our accounts receivable and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  historical experience  communications with the customers  credit history and current economic conditions 
we also maintain an estimated reserve for potential future product returns and discounts given related to trade ins and to current period product sales  which is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which is included in the sales returns and allowance accounts on our balance sheet 
as of september   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances of million 
we believe our reported allowances at september  are adequate 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we might need to record additional allowances  resulting in additional expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination would be made 
although we are not typically contractually obligated to provide trade in allowances under existing sales contracts  we may offer such allowances when negotiating new sales arrangements 
when pricing sales transactions  we contemplate both cash consideration and the net realizable value of any used equipment to be traded in 
the trade in allowance value stated in a sales order may differ from the estimated net realizable value of the underlying equipment 
any excess in the trade in allowance over the estimated net realizable value of the used equipment represents additional sales discount 
we account for product sales transactions by recording as revenue the total of the cash consideration and the estimated net realizable value of the trade in equipment less a normal profit margin 
any difference between the estimated net realizable value of the used equipment and the trade in allowance granted is recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the sale 
used zoll equipment is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review our reserves to ensure that the balance sheet value associated with our trade in equipment is properly stated 
if the trade in equipment is a competitor s product  we will usually resell the product to a third party distributor who specializes in sale of used medical equipment  without any refurbishment 
we typically do not recognize a profit upon the resale of a competitor s used equipment  although as a result of the inherent nature of the estimation process  we could recognize either a nominal gain or loss 
fair value measurements during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures formerly referenced as sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
this 
table of contents new accounting standard does not require any new fair value measurements 
we apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we have elected to defer implementation of fasb asc as it relates to our non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until the first quarter of fiscal we believe the implementation of fasb asc as it relates to non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities  which are required to be recorded at fair value  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  such as inherent risk  transfer restrictions and credit risk 
during the first quarter of  we adopted fasb asc  financial instruments formerly referenced as sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value 
we have not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments 
refer to note l  fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for additional information 
warranty reserves our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance over a specified period of time  usually one year for pre hospital and international customers and five years for hospital customers 
revenue is deferred for pre hospital customers who receive warranties beyond one year 
such revenue is then recognized over the period of extended warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product is shipped and revenue is recognized 
the costs that we estimate include material  labor  and shipping 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we believe that our recorded liability of million at september  is adequate to cover future costs for the servicing of our products sold through that date and under warranty 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or obsolete  or because the amount on hand is in excess of future needs 
we provide for the total value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
we estimate excess inventory amounts by reviewing quantities on hand and comparing those quantities to sales forecasts for the next months  identifying historical service usage trends  and matching that usage with the installed base quantities to estimate future needs 
at september   our inventory was recorded at net realizable value requiring reserves of million  or of our million gross inventories 

table of contents goodwill at september   we had approximately million in goodwill  primarily resulting from our acquisitions of revivant approximately million  the assets of lifecor approximately million  certain assets of bio key international  inc approximately million  the assets of infusion dynamics approximately million  and the assets of alsius approximately million 
we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
fair value is determined based on an estimate of the discounted future cash flows expected from the reporting units 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment on the part of management about future revenues  expenses and other assumptions that contribute to the net cash flows of the reporting units 
additionally  we periodically review our goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment has occurred 
long lived assets we periodically review the carrying amount of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  and intangible assets  to assess potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the determination includes evaluation of factors such as current market value  business climate and future cash flows expected to result from the use of the related assets 
fair value is determined based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows in assessing potential impairment and to record an impairment loss based on fair value in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
this process requires judgment on the part of management 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
the provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and those deferred as a result of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered and evaluated when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
any increase or decrease in a valuation allowance could have a material adverse or beneficial impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which the determination is made 
we adopted the provisions of fasb asc  income tax  formerly fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on october  the provision contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit  including resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
this provision also provides guidance on classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
stock based compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  we measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize cost over the requisite service period 
we recognize compensation expense on fixed awards with pro rata vesting on a straight line basis over the vesting period

safe harbor statement certain statements contained herein constitute forward looking statements as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of the act and releases issued by the sec and within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  see  plan  future  may  could  and other expressions which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters identify forward looking statements 
particularly  the company s expectations regarding its business  operational results  future operational liquidity  contractual obligations and other commercial commitments  and capital requirements are forward looking statements 
reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the actions of competitors  the acceptance of our products in their respective markets  adverse economic conditions  and those other risks and uncertainties contained in item a in part i of this annual report on form k entitled risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have cash equivalents and marketable securities that primarily consist of money market accounts and fixed rate  asset backed corporate securities 
the majority of these investments have maturities within one to five years 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the term and type of our investments and that the fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have international subsidiaries in canada  the united kingdom  the netherlands  france  germany  austria  australia  and new zealand 
these subsidiaries transact business in their functional or local currency 
therefore  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks and fluctuations in foreign currencies  along with economic and political instability in the foreign countries in which we operate  all of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage our currency transaction exposures 
these currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow  fair value or net investment hedges under fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and therefore  are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings 
these derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk since gains and losses on those derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
we had one forward exchange contract outstanding serving as a hedge of our euro intercompany receivables in the notional amount of approximately million euros at september  the contract serves as a hedge of a substantial portion of our euro denominated intercompany balances 
the fair value of this contract at september  was approximately million  resulting in an unrealized gain of  a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of the euro derivative foreign exchange contract outstanding at september  indicates that if the us dollar weakened by against the euro  the fair value of this contract would decrease by approximately  resulting in a total loss on the contract of approximately  conversely  if the us dollar strengthened by against the euro  the fair value of this contract would increase by approximately  resulting in a total gain on the contract of approximately  
table of contents any gains and losses on the fair value of the derivative contract would be largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transaction 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the analysis below
