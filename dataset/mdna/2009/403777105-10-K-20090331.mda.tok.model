the effect of the consumer product safety laws is expected to diminish by the third quarter of fiscal due to the company s product cycle lifespan 
the duration and severity of the negative impact of the current global economic downturn is uncertain 
the company continues to expect that future increases in net sales and net income will be dependent on  among other factors such as economic conditions  its ability to expand its two newer growth concepts  janie and jack and crazy  continue to reduce product costs while maintaining high quality standards  generate more sales to existing customers in the core gymboree division through growth of the boy department business and increased newborn product assortment  and attract new customers through strategies such as direct mail campaigns and cross brand marketing

to foster long term growth  the company will continue to strategically evaluate the best uses of the company s assets in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies and estimates that management believes are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market lcm  determined on a weighted average basis 
the company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and records a reserve when the future estimated selling price is less than cost 
this reserve is based on management s estimate of overall business conditions including stocking positions  inventory aging  historical performance and the promotional environment 
the company takes a physical count of inventories in all stores once a year and in some stores twice a year  and performs cycle counts throughout the year in its distribution centers 
the company records an inventory shrink adjustment based upon physical counts and also provides for estimated shrink adjustments for the period between the last physical inventory count and each balance sheet date 
the company s inventory shrink estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrink trends 
the company s lcm estimate can be affected by changes in consumer demand and the promotional environment 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lcm or inventory shortage reserves 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or our actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate  our operating results could be affected 
asset impairment 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  the company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
decisions to close a store or facility can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
for locations to be closed that are under long term leases  the company records a charge for lease buyout expense or the difference between its rent and the rate at which it expects to be able to sublease the properties and related cost  as appropriate 
most closures occur upon the lease expiration 
the company s estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience  and in  considered the current economic downturn in future sales assumptions 
these estimates can be affected by factors that are difficult to predict  such as future store profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment losses of long lived assets 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the calculations  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
the company s recorded asset impairment charges have not been and are not expected to be material 

table of contents income taxes 
the company provides for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
the company is subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions  such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities  changes in facts and circumstances  issuance of new regulations  and resolution of tax audits 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized at the point of sale in retail stores 
online revenue is recorded when the company estimates merchandise is delivered to the customer 
customers generally receive merchandise within three to five days of shipment 
shipping fees received from customers are included in net sales and the associated shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 
the company also sells gift cards in its retail store locations  through its online stores  and through third parties 
revenue is recognized in the period that the gift card is redeemed 
the company recognizes unredeemed gift card and merchandise credit balances over three years old as other income within selling  general and administrative expenses 
sales are presented net of a sales return reserve  which is estimated based on historical return trends 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected
