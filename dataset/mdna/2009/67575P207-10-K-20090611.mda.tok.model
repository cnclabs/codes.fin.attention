item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that develops  manufactures and markets a family of products  based on our platform technology called microcyn  intended to help prevent and treat infections in chronic and acute wounds 
microcyn is a non irritating oxychlorine compound designed to treat a wide range of pathogens  including antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria  viruses  fungi and spores 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to exercise its judgment 
we exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting polices and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  our recognition of revenues and expenses  and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
areas in which we exercise significant judgment include  but are not necessarily limited to  our valuation of accounts receivable  inventory  income taxes  equity transactions compensatory and financing and contingencies 
we have also adopted certain polices with respect to our recognition of revenue that we believe are consistent with the guidance provided under securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
we base our estimates and judgments on a variety of factors including our historical experience  knowledge of our business and industry  current and expected economic conditions  the attributes of our products  regulatory environment  and in certain cases  the results of outside appraisals 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates and 
table of contents assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary 
while we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies  we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate 
since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment  actual results could differ from such estimates 
a description of significant accounting polices that require us to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is as follows stock based compensation prior to april   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations and applied the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
we used the minimum value method to measure the fair value of awards issued prior to april  with respect to our application of the disclosure requirements under sfas no 
effective april   we adopted sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r using the prospective method 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 and supersedes apb opinion no 
 and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r addresses all forms of share based payment  or sbp  awards including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
under sfas r  sbp awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards grant date  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest and will result in a charge to operations 
we had a choice of two attribution methods for allocating compensation costs under sfas r the straight line method  which allocates expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the last separately vesting portion of an award  or the graded vesting attribution method  which allocates expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was  in substance  multiple awards 
we chose the former method and amortized the fair value of each option on a straight line basis over the requisite period of the last separately vesting portion of each award 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we generate product revenues from sales of our products to hospitals  medical centers  doctors  pharmacies  distributors and strategic partners 
we sell our products directly to third parties and to distributors through various cancelable distribution agreements 
we have also entered into an agreement to license our products 
we apply the revenue recognition principles set forth in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  revenue recognition  with respect to all of our revenues 
accordingly  we record revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the sale is reasonably assured 
we require all of our product sales to be supported by evidence of a sale transaction that clearly indicates the selling price to the customer  shipping terms and payment terms 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a contract or purchase order approved by the customer 
we have ongoing relationships with certain customers from which we customarily accept orders by telephone in lieu of a purchase order 
we recognize revenues at the time in which we receive a confirmation that the goods were either tendered at their destination when shipped fob destination  or transferred to a shipping agent when shipped fob shipping point 
delivery to the customer is deemed to have occurred when the customer takes title to the product 
generally  title passes to the customer upon shipment  but could occur when the customer receives the product based on the terms of the agreement with the customer 
while we have a policy of investigating the creditworthiness of our customers  we have  under certain circumstances  shipped goods in the past and deferred the recognition of revenues when available information 
table of contents indicates that collection is in doubt 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts when available information causes us to believe that a credit loss is probable 
we market a substantial portion of our goods through distributors 
in europe  we defer recognition of distributor generated revenues until the time we confirm that distributors have sold these goods 
although our terms provide for no right of return  our products have a finite shelf life and we may  at our discretion  accommodate distributors by accepting returns to avoid the distribution of expired goods 
service revenues are recorded upon performance of the service contracts 
revenues generated from testing contracts are recorded when the test is completed and the final report is sent to the customer 
inventory and cost of revenues we state our inventory at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out method  or market  based on standard costs 
establishing standard manufacturing costs requires us to make estimates and assumptions as to the quantities and costs of materials  labor and overhead that are required to produce a finished good 
cost of service revenues is expensed when incurred 
income taxes we are required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense or loss based upon tax statutes in jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
in making these estimates  we adjust our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities  as a result of these differences  are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences in loss and credit carryforwards that will reverse in subsequent years 
we also establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
valuation allowances are based  in part  on predictions that management must make as to our results in future periods 
the outcome of events could differ over time which would require that we make changes in our valuation allowance 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these estimates and assumptions include reserves and write downs related to receivables and inventories  the recoverability of long term assets  deferred taxes and related valuation allowances and valuation of equity instruments

table of contents comparison of fiscal years ended march  and revenues we experienced a growth in product revenues and a growth in our services business  resulting in total revenues of  during the twelve months ended march  compared to  in the prior year period 
the  increase in product revenues was due primarily to  higher sales in mexico despite a drop in the value of the peso 
mexico sales increased on higher unit volumes of our microcyn wound care product to hospitals and pharmacies  as well as higher average selling prices in both our liter and our milliliter presentations 
if the peso had not declined  the growth in mexico sales would have been compared to the prior year 
sales of milliliter units in mexico increased on improvements to both units sold and higher average selling prices as compared to the prior year period 
additionally  sales to hospitals in mexico increased on both higher unit shipments and selling prices 
europe row sales increased  up  over the prior year due to initial sales to china bao tai in china  as well as strong sales growth to our customers in india  singapore  middle east and slovakia 
the following table shows our product revenues by geographic region in thousands fiscal year ended march  increase increase us europe row mexico total the  increase in service revenues was due to an increase in the number of tests provided by our services business 
gross profit loss we reported gross profit from our microcyn products business of  or of product revenues  during the months ended march   compared a gross profit of  or  in the prior year period 
this increase was primarily due to lower costs in europe and the improvements in our mexico operations  which have improved margins to during the twelve months ended march   compared to in the prior year period 
lower costs in europe have put our european operation in a positive gross margin position during the twelve months ended march   compared to a gross loss position in the prior year period 
our services business continues to be at or near breakeven as it was in the prior year period 
research and development expense research and development expense declined  or  to  for the twelve months ended march   compared to  in the prior year period 
most of the decrease was attributable to outside clinical expenses  which were  higher than it was in the prior year period  which were related the costs of the phase ii clinical trial last year 
during the first part of the current fiscal year  we increased our personnel  while in the later part of the second and third fiscal quarters  we significantly reduced the number of people in research and development  so that the net cost of personnel was lower for the year 
this expense also includes a  net loss on the disposal of certain research and development manufacturing equipment and severance costs of  we expect that our research and development expense will remain fairly flat since most of the reductions have been reflected in the quarter ended march  selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased  or  to  during the twelve months ended march   from  during the twelve months ended march  primarily  this increase was due to a  increase in non cash stock compensation expense 
in addition  there was  
table of contents of severance expense associated with terminations during the period 
sales and marketing fees were also higher by  primarily associated with our us microcyn wound care product launch 
these increases were offset in large part by  lower bonus expense  by  lower legal and accounting fees and an overall reduction in headcount and related expenses we expect these expenses to grow in future periods as we spend more money on expanding the sales in the us market 
interest income and expense and other income and expense interest expense decreased  or  to  for the twelve months ended march   from  in the prior year period  due to the payments made on debt over the prior year 
total outstanding debt decreased  to  at march   from  at march  interest income decreased  to  for the twelve months ended march   from  in the prior year period  primarily due to the decrease in our interest bearing cash balance over the past year 
other income and expense decreased  to net other expense of  for the twelve months ended march   from net other income of  for the twelve months ended march  primarily this decrease was due to our intercompany notes to europe and mexico being reclassified in our second fiscal quarter as long term  and therefore no foreign currency adjustment was required to revalue the notes after the second fiscal quarter 
in prior periods  this account consisted of charges due to the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates  and the resulting gain or loss recognized for the revaluation of our intercompany notes payable denominated in non local currencies 
net loss net loss for the twelve months ended march  was  down  from  for the same period in the prior year 
stock compensation expense for the fiscal years ended march  and were  and  respectively 
the total severance cost for this fiscal year was  liquidity and capital resources we incurred net losses of  for the year ended march  at march   our accumulated deficit amounted to  we had working capital of  as of march  we need to raise additional capital from external sources in order to sustain our operations while continuing the longer term efforts contemplated under our business plan 
we expect to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future and must raise additional capital to pursue our product development initiatives  penetrate markets for the sale of our products and continue as a going concern 
we cannot provide any assurance that it will raise additional capital 
we believe that we have access to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaborations or other means  however  we have not secured any commitment for new financing at this time nor can we provide any assurance that new financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if the economic climate in the us does not improve or continues to deteriorate  our ability to raise additional capital could be negatively impacted 
if we are unable to secure additional capital  we may be required to curtail our research and development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations 
these measures could cause significant delays in our efforts to commercialize our products in the united states  which is critical to the realization of our business plan and the future operations 
these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the we be unable to continue as a going concern 
sources of liquidity as of march   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of  since our inception  substantially all of our operations have been financed through sales of equity securities 
other sources of financing that we have used to date include our revenues  as well as various loans 

table of contents since our inception  substantially all of our operations have been financed through the sale of  net proceeds of our common and convertible preferred stock 
this includes  net proceeds  raised in our initial public offering on january   net proceeds of  raised in a private placement of common shares on august   net proceeds of  raised through a registered direct placement from march  to april   net proceeds of  raised through a private placement on february  and net proceeds of  from a private placement on february  and proceeds of  from a private placement on june  in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution to borrow a maximum of  under this facility we borrowed  of which  was paid in the year ended march  the loan was repaid in full at march  cash flows as of march   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of  compared to  at march  net cash used in operating activities during the twelve months ended march  was  primarily due to the  net loss for the period  and to a  decrease in accounts payable  primarily the result of payments made for the placement agent fee related to our registered direct offering in march that were paid subsequent to march   and a  decrease in accrued expenses  related mostly to accrued bonuses earned during the fiscal year ended march  these uses of cash were offset in part by non cash charges during the year ended march   including  of stock based compensation   of depreciation and amortization   of non cash interest expense  and  of loss on the disposal of capital equipment 
net cash used in operating activities during the year ended march  was  primarily due to the  net loss for the period  and to a lesser extent a  increase in accrued bonuses during the year and  of foreign currency gain 
these uses of cash were offset in part by non cash charges during the year ended march   including  of stock based compensation   of depreciation and amortization   of non cash interest expense and  increase in accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was  and  for the twelve months ended march  and  respectively 
primarily this cash was used during the periods for purchasing lab and manufacturing equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the twelve months ended march  stock was issued for  and  of outstanding debt was paid off during the period 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the twelve months ended march  this involved debt payments totaling  which included the full payment on a million note payable to robert burlingame and  of net funds received in connection with the issuance of common stock 
contractual obligations as of march   we had contractual obligations as follows long term debt and capital lease amounts include principal payments only in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years long term debt capital leases operating leases total we currently lease approximately  square feet of office  research and manufacturing space in petaluma  california  which serves as our principal executive offices 
we also lease approximately  square feet of office space in an adjacent building for research and development under the lease agreement 
the lease was scheduled to 
table of contents expire on september  on september   we entered into amendment no 
to the property lease agreement for our facility in petaluma  california 
the amendment extended the lease expiration date to september  on may   we entered into amendment no 
to the property lease agreement for our facility in petaluma  california 
pursuant to the amendment  we agreed to surrender  square feet of office space and extended the lease expiration on the remaining lease to september  we lease approximately  square feet of office and manufacturing space and approximately  square feet of warehouse space in zapopan  mexico  under a lease that expires in april and april we lease approximately  square feet of office space and approximately  square feet of manufacturing and warehouse space in sittard  the netherlands  under a lease that was scheduled to expire on january  on february   we extended this lease to january on february   the we amended this lease agreement 
the amendment shortens the lease period from january  to september  as we expand  we may need to establish manufacturing facilities in other countries 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we incurred a net loss of  for the twelve months ended march  at march  and  our accumulated deficit amounted to  and  respectively 
at march   our working capital amounted to  we need to raise additional capital from external sources in order to sustain our operations while continuing the longer term efforts contemplated under our business plan 
we expect to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future and must raise additional capital to pursue our product development initiatives  to penetrate markets for the sale of our products and for us to continue as a going concern 
we may not raise additional capital 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we will be required to curtail certain operating activities  and implement additional cost reductions in an effort to conserve capital in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations for the next twelve months 
these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we believe that we have access to capital resources through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaborations or other means  however  we have not secured any commitment for new financing at this time and new financing may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to secure additional capital  we may be required to curtail our research and development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve cash 
these measures could cause significant delays in our efforts to commercialize our products in the united states  which is critical to the realization of our business plan and our future operations 
we have undertaken initiatives to reduce costs in an effort to conserve liquidity 
future pivotal trials will require the selection of a partner and must also be completed in order for us to commercialize microcyn as a drug product in the united states 
commencement of the pivotal clinical trials will be delayed until we find a strategic partner to fund these trials 
without a strategic partner or additional capital  our pivotal clinical trials will be delayed for a period of time that is currently indeterminate 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the effect of competing technological and market developments  
table of contents the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies
