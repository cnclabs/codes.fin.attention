monsanto company form k distribution of products we have a worldwide distribution and sales and marketing organization for our seeds and traits 
we sell our products under monsanto brands and license technology and genetic material to others for sale under their own brands 
through distributors  independent retailers and dealers  agricultural cooperatives  plant raisers  and agents  we market our dekalb  asgrow and deltapine branded germplasm to farmers in every agricultural region of the world 
in the united states  we market regional seed brands under our american seeds  llc and channel bio  llc businesses to farmers directly  as well as through dealers  agricultural cooperatives and agents 
in countries where they are approved for sale  we market and sell our trait technologies with our branded germplasm  pursuant to license agreements with our farmer customers 
in brazil and paraguay  we have implemented a point of delivery  grain based payment system we contract with grain handlers to collect applicable trait fees when farmers deliver their grain 
in addition to selling our products under our own brands  we license a broad package of germplasm and trait technologies to large and small seed companies in the united states and certain international markets 
those seed companies in turn market our trait technologies in their branded germplasm  they may also market our germplasm under their own brand name 
our vegetable seeds are marketed in more than countries through distributors  independent retailers and dealers  agricultural cooperatives  plant raisers and agents  as well as directly to farmers 
competition the global market for the products of our seeds and genomics segment is competitive and the competition has intensified 
both our row crops and our vegetable seed businesses compete with numerous multinational agrichemical and seed marketers globally and with hundreds of smaller companies regionally 
with the exception of competitors in our seminis and de ruiter vegetable seed business  most of our seed competitors are also licensees of our germplasm or biotechnology traits 
in certain countries  we also compete with government owned seed companies 
our biotechnology traits compete as a system with other practices  including the application of agricultural chemicals  and traits developed by other companies 
our weed and insect control systems compete with chemical and seed products produced by other agrichemical and seed marketers 
competition for the discovery of new traits based on biotechnology or genomics is likely to come from major global agrichemical companies  smaller biotechnology research companies and institutions  state funded programs  and academic institutions 
enabling technologies to enhance biotechnology trait development may also come from academic researchers and biotechnology research companies 
competitors using our technology outside of license terms and farmers who save seed from one year to the next in violation of license or other commercial terms also affect competitive conditions 
product performance in particular  crop vigor and yield for our row crops and quality for our vegetable seeds  customer support and service  intellectual property rights and protection  product availability and planning  and price are important elements of our market success in seeds 
in addition  distributor  retailer and farmer relationships are important in the united states and many other countries 
the primary factors underlying the competitive success of traits are performance and commercial viability  timeliness of introduction  value compared with other practices and products  market coverage  service provided to distributors  retailers and farmers  governmental approvals  value capture  public acceptance  and environmental characteristics 
patents  trademarks  and licenses in the united states and many foreign countries  we hold a broad business portfolio of patents  trademarks and licenses that provide intellectual property protection for our seeds and genomics related products and processes 
we routinely obtain patents and or plant variety protection for our breeding technology  germplasm  commercial varietal seed products  and for the parents of our commercial hybrid seed products 
we also routinely obtain registrations for our germplasm and commercial seed products in registration countries  as well as plant variety protection act certificates in the united states and equivalent plant breeders rights in other countries 
our insect protection traits including yieldgard corn borer and yieldgard corn rootworm traits in corn seed and bollgard trait in cotton seed are protected by patents that extend at least until having filed patent applications in and  we anticipate that the bollgard ii insect protection trait will be patent protected in the united states  and in other areas in which patent protection was sought  at least through our herbicide tolerant products roundup ready traits in soybean  corn  canola and cotton seeds are protected by us patents that extend at least until  our second generation trait for cotton  roundup ready flex  is protected by us patents through monsanto company form k monsanto broadly licenses technology and patents to other parties 
we also hold licenses from other parties relating to certain products and processes 
for example  we have obtained licenses to protect certain technologies we use to produce roundup ready seeds and certain technologies relating to our pipeline products from claims that we are infringing the patents of others 
these licenses last for the lifetimes of the applicable patents  after which the respective patented technologies will no longer be subject to the terms of the license 
we have also obtained perpetual licenses to certain technologies contained in certain pipeline products such as genuity smartstax corn  which combines insect control traits with herbicide resistant traits 
we hold numerous licenses in connection with our genomics program 
for example  we hold a perpetual license to certain genomics technologies for use in plant agriculture  perpetual licenses to patents expiring from to for classes of proprietary genes for the development of commercial traits in crops  perpetual licenses to functional characterizations of our proprietary genes  and perpetual licenses to certain genomics sequences and certain genomics technologies 
we own trademark registrations  and we file trademark applications for the names and many of the designs we use on our branded products around the world 
important company trademarks include roundup ready  bollgard  bollgard ii  yieldgard  genuity roundup ready yield and genuity smartstax for traits  dekalb  asgrow  deltapine  and vistive for row crop seeds  and seminis and de ruiter for vegetable seeds 
raw materials and energy resources in growing locations throughout the world  we produce directly or contract with third party growers for corn seed  soybean seed  vegetable seeds  cotton seed  canola seed and other seeds 
the availability and cost of seed depends primarily on seed yields  weather conditions  farmer contract terms  commodity prices  and global supply and demand 
we seek to manage commodity price fluctuations through the use of futures contracts and other hedging mechanisms 
where practicable  we attempt to minimize the weather risks by producing seed at multiple growing locations and under irrigated conditions 
our seeds and genomics segment also purchases the energy we need to process our seed  these energy purchases are managed in conjunction with our agricultural productivity segment 
agricultural productivity segment through our agricultural productivity segment  we manufacture roundup brand herbicides and other herbicides and provide lawn and garden herbicide products for the residential market 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a agricultural productivity segment the tabular information about net sales of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides and other agricultural productivity products is incorporated by reference herein 
major products applications major brands glyphosate based herbicides nonselective agricultural  industrial  ornamental and turf applications for weed control roundup selective herbicides control of preemergent annual grass and small seeded broadleaf weeds in corn and other crops harness for corn and cotton lawn and garden herbicides residential lawn and garden applications for weed control roundup distribution of products in some world areas we use the same distribution and sales and marketing organization for our crop protection products as for our seeds and traits 
in other world areas  we have separate distribution and sales and marketing organizations for our crop protection products 
we sell our crop protection products through distributors  independent retailers and dealers and agricultural cooperatives 
in some cases outside the united states  we sell such products directly to farmers 
we also sell certain of the chemical intermediates of our crop protection products to other major agricultural chemical producers  who then market their own branded products to farmers 
we market our lawn and garden herbicide products through the scotts miracle gro company 
monsanto company form k competition our agricultural herbicide products have numerous major global competitors who increased production which  coupled with purchases from local generic companies  has increased channel inventory for generic glyphosate 
competition from local or regional companies may also be significant 
our lawn and garden business has fewer than five significant national competitors and a larger number of regional competitors in the united states 
the largest market for our lawn and garden herbicides is the united states 
competitive success in crop protection products depends on price  product performance  the scope of solutions offered to farmers  market coverage  product availability and planning  and the service provided to distributors  retailers and farmers 
our lawn and garden herbicides compete on product performance and the brand value associated with our trademark roundup 
for additional information on competition for our agricultural herbicides  see item md a outlook agricultural productivity  which is incorporated by reference herein 
patents  trademarks  licenses  franchises and concessions the intellectual property protection portfolio for our agricultural productivity segment is less broad in scope than the portfolio for our seeds and genomics segment 
patents protecting glyphosate  an active ingredient in roundup herbicides  have expired in the united states and all other countries 
however  some of the patents on our glyphosate formulations and manufacturing processes in the united states and other countries extend beyond we have obtained perpetual licenses to chemicals used to make harness herbicides  and we hold trademark registrations for the brands under which our chemistries are sold 
the most significant trademark in this segment is roundup 
we hold directly or by assignment numerous phosphate leases issued on behalf of or granted by the us government  the state of idaho  and private parties 
none of these leases is material individually  but they are significant in the aggregate because elemental phosphorus is a key raw material for the production of glyphosate based herbicides 
the phosphate leases have varying terms 
the leases obtained from the us government are of indefinite duration  subject to the modification of lease terms at year intervals 
environmental matters our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
some of these laws restrict the amount and type of emissions that our operations can release into the environment 
other laws  such as the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  usc et seq 
superfund  can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any former or current site owners or operators or any parties who sent waste to these sites  without regard to fault or to the lawfulness of the original disposal 
these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time  they may become more stringent 
we are committed to long term environmental protection and compliance programs that reduce and monitor emissions of hazardous materials into the environment  and to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns 
in accord with a consent order with the state of idaho  we have embarked on a multiyear program to reduce certain air emissions from our facility at soda springs  idaho 
although the costs of our compliance with environmental laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty  such costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our earnings or competitive position 
in addition to compliance obligations at our own manufacturing locations and off site disposal facilities  under the terms of our sept 
  separation agreement with pharmacia the separation agreement  we are required to indemnify pharmacia for any liability it may have for environmental remediation or other environmental responsibilities that are primarily related to pharmacia s former agricultural and chemicals businesses 
for information regarding certain environmental proceedings  see item legal proceedings 
see also information regarding remediation of waste disposal sites and reserves for remediation  appearing in note commitments and contingencies  which is incorporated herein by reference 
raw materials and energy resources we are a significant purchaser of basic and intermediate raw materials 
typically  we purchase major raw materials and energy through long term contracts 
we buy our raw materials from a number of suppliers  only a few major suppliers provide us with certain important raw materials 
the markets for our raw materials are balanced and are expected to remain so 
although some additional capacity does exist  pricing is substantially higher today than under existing contracts 
energy is available as required  but pricing is subject to market fluctuations 
monsanto company form k at various sites globally  two major manufacturers use our proprietary technology to make the catalysts used in various intermediate steps in the production of glyphosate 
each supplier has excess capacity to meet our requirements and we seek to minimize risks associated with production outages by maintaining adequate safety stock levels 
we manufacture and purchase disodium iminodiacetic acid  a key ingredient in the production of glyphosate 
we manufacture our global supply of elemental phosphorus  a key raw material for the production of roundup herbicides 
we have multiple mineral rights which  subject to obtaining and maintaining appropriate mining permits  will provide a long term supply of phosphate ore to meet our needs into the foreseeable future 
as part of the ongoing course of operating our phosphorus production  we are required to periodically permit new mining leases 
a new mine is currently in the process of being permitted with the us bureau of land management 
research and development monsanto s expenses for research and development were  million in  million in and million in in addition  we incurred charges of million in  million in and million in for acquired in process research and development ipr d related to acquisitions 
see note business combinations for additional information regarding these acquisitions 
seasonality and working capital  backlog for information on seasonality and working capital and backlog practices  see information in item md a financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources  which is incorporated herein by reference 
employee relations as of aug 
  we employed about  regular employees worldwide and more than  temporary employees 
the number of temporary employees varies greatly during the year because of the seasonal nature of our business 
we believe that relations between monsanto and its employees are satisfactory 
customers although no single customer including affiliates represented more than percent of our consolidated worldwide net sales in  our three largest us agricultural distributors and their affiliates represented  in the aggregate  percent of our worldwide net sales and percent of our us net sales 
during  one major us distributor and its affiliates represented about percent of the worldwide net sales for our seeds and genomics segment  and about percent of the worldwide net sales for our agricultural productivity segment 
international operations see item a under the heading our operations outside the united states are subject to special risks and restrictions  which could negatively affect our results of operations and profitability and note segment and geographic data  which are incorporated herein by reference 
approximately percent of monsanto s sales  including percent of our seeds and genomics segment s sales and percent of our agricultural productivity segment s sales  originated from our legal entities outside the united states during fiscal year segment and geographic data for information on segment and geographic data  see
