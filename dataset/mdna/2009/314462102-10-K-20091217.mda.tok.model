item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the female health company fhc or the company manufactures  markets and sells the fc female condom  the only currently available product under a woman s control that is approved by the us food and drug administration fda 
fc provides dual protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections stis  including hiv aids 
in october  the company completed the transition from its first generation product  fc  to its second generation product  fc  and production of fc ceased 
although fc production has ceased  the company retains its ownership of certain world wide rights to fc  as well as various patents  regulatory approvals and other intellectual property related to fc during  the company began development of its second generation female condom  fc  which was completed in in august   after a stringent technical review  the world health organization cleared fc for purchase by un agencies 
the first substantial sales of fc occurred in the second quarter of fiscal on march   fc received fda approval as a class iii medical device 
fc became available in the united states in august fda approval also enabled the united states agency for international development usaid to procure fc for distribution for global hiv aids prevention programs 
in addition to fda approval  the fc female condom has been approved by other regulatory agencies  including the european union  india  and brazil 
from its introduction through september   nearly million fc female condoms have been distributed in countries 
the fda approval permitted the company to transition from fc to fc the last shipment of fc was produced in october all current and future orders will be for fc revenues 
most of the company s revenues have been derived from sales of the fc female condoms fc and fc  and are recognized upon shipment of the product to its customers 
beginning in fiscal  revenue is also being derived from licensing its intellectual property to its business partner in india  hindustan lifecare limited 
such revenue appears as royalties on the audited consolidated statements of income for the years ended september  and the company s strategy is to develop a global market and distribution network for its product by maintaining relationships with public sector groups and completing partnership arrangements with companies with the necessary marketing and financial resources and local market expertise 
the company s customers include the following the company sold the fc female condom to the global public sector under the umbrella of its agreement with unaids 
this agreement facilitated the availability and distribution of the female condom at a reduced price based on the company s cost of production 
the most recent price per unit ranged between and british pounds sterling  or approximately to  depending on contractual volumes 
with the completion of the transition from fc to fc  the company s agreement with unaids to supply fc to developing countries will not be renewed 
the company has elected not to enter into long term agreements to supply fc to global agencies  and instead intends to provide uniform  volume based pricing to such agencies 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company sold fc female condoms to the us agency for international development usaid for use in usaid prevention programs in developing countries 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  usaid transitioned to fc and  through its procurement agent  john snow  inc  placed its first fc order for million units 
the company has sold the fc female condoms fc and fc in the united states to city and state public health clinics as well as not for profit organizations such as planned parenthood 
occasionally  significant quarter to quarter variations may occur due to the timing and shipment of large orders  not from any fundamental change in the company s business 
because the company manufactured fc in a leased facility located in london  england and fc in a leased facility located in malaysia  a portion of the company s operating costs are denominated in foreign currencies 
while a material portion of the company s future sales are likely to be in foreign markets  all sales are denominated in either british pounds sterling or united states dollars 
manufacturing costs and sales to foreign markets are subject to normal currency risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rate of the malaysian ringgit myr relative to british pounds sterling  and british pounds sterling relative to the united states dollar 
in july  the company contributed capital to a subsidiary to reduce its exposure to future currency gains or losses between the entities 
management continues to evaluate the company s commercial transactions and to evaluate whether employing currency hedging strategies are appropriate 
while our second generation product  fc  generally is sold at a lower price per unit than fc was  fc is produced at a lower cost than fc was  and sales of fc generally have a higher gross margin than fc had 
as a result  changes in the sales mix of fc as compared to fc affect our net revenues and gross profit 
expenses 
the company manufactured fc at its facility located in the united kingdom and manufactures fc at its facility located in selangor de  malaysia 
the company s cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct material costs  direct labor costs and indirect production and distribution costs 
direct material costs include raw materials used to make the female condom  principally polyurethane for fc and a nitrile polymer for fc indirect product costs include logistics  quality control and maintenance expenses  as well as costs for helium  nitrogen  electricity and other utilities 
all of the key components for the manufacture of the female condom are essentially available from either multiple sources or multiple locations within a source 
the company has experienced increased costs of products  supplies  salaries and benefits  and increased general and administrative expenses 
in both fiscal and fiscal  the company has increased selling prices wherever possible to offset such cost increases 
as noted above  the company s manufacturing costs are subject to currency risks associated with changes in the exchange rate of the malaysian ringgit myr relative to british pounds sterling and british pounds sterling relative to the united states dollar 
to date  the company s management has not deemed it appropriate to utilize currency hedging strategies to manage its currency risks 
on august   the company announced to its uk employees that the company would evaluate the future of its uk facility following the decision of two of its largest customers to switch their purchases from the first generation product  fc  manufactured in the uk facility  to the second generation product  fc  which is manufactured in malaysia 
as is required by british labor law  the company went through an evaluation process  working in tandem with employee representatives  in which various manufacturing alternatives were considered 
as the process failed to identify a satisfactory alternative  the facility s manufacturing operations ceased in october  when the final fc orders were shipped 
the evaluation process concluded in late november  when employees received their termination payments 
in fiscal  the company incurred a one time charge of  for restructuring costs related to the cessation of fc manufacturing at its uk facility 
all of the company s other uk operations will continue without interruption 
the functions include  but are not limited to  global sales and marketing of the company s female condom  management and direction of global manufacturing operations  management and direction of the global technical support team  and product development 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company received an offer from the new owner of the property to surrender its existing uk facility lease  which would have expired in december  in exchange for a surrender fee and a new short term lease 
on november   the company entered into the new lease and related agreements 
the rent under the new lease remains approximately  annually and the company deposited the amount of one year s rent upon execution of the new agreement 
in connection with the new lease  the company made an initial lease surrender payment of approximately  an additional lease surrender payment of approximately  will be due on or before february  from a cash flow perspective  replacing the previous lease at this time eliminates future payments of approximately million for rent and related expenses over the remaining term of the previous lease  producing a positive net impact of million after deducting the lease surrender payments 
the new lease expires on the earlier of at least three months after the landlord provides a notice of termination  but in any event not before may  and november  the lease buyout and related expenses resulted in a one time charge of approximately million  net of the recognition of deferred gain on the sale of the facility of  that is being recognized as incurred in fiscal operating highlights

the company had net revenues of  in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to net revenues of  in the fiscal year ended september  the company s fiscal unit sales and net revenues were limited by fc capacity constraints and increased demand by customers who had not transitioned to fc the company elected not to invest in the expansion of fc production capacity in view of the probable cessation of fc production given fda approval of fc in fiscal  fc comprised of the units sold compared to in fiscal all current and future orders will be for fc the company generated cash flow from operations of  for the fiscal year ended september  and  for the fiscal year ended september  the company had net income attributable to common stockholders of  or per diluted share in fiscal in fiscal  the company had net income attributable to common stockholders of  or per diluted share

see discussion of non gaap financial information below 
following is a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure of operating income exclusive of restructuring charge to the nearest gaap financial measure of operating income for the years ended september  and for the years ended september operating income exclusive of restructuring charge less restructuring charge operating income the company recorded non operating income of  in compared to non operating income of  in this was primarily attributable to a significant gain on foreign currency of  in  compared to a comparatively modest gain of  in fiscal the financial statements of the company s international subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities  the historical exchange rate for stockholders equity and a weighted average exchange rate for each period for revenues  expenses and gains and losses

an entity is able to recognize a tax benefit for current or past losses when it can demonstrate that the tax loss carry forward will be utilized before expiration 
management believes that the company s recent and projected future growth and profitability has made it more likely than not that the company will utilize a portion of its net operating carryforwards in the future 
the company has recorded a tax benefit in the amount of  gross tax benefit during the year ended september  compared to  for the year ended september  as a result of the decrease in the valuation allowance on these assets 
non gaap financial information this section includes non gaap financial information  specifically operating income exclusive of the restructuring charge of  management believes that the presentation of this non gaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because this information may allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance and certain components of the company s results 
in addition  because the restructuring charge related to a non recurring event in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company believes that the presentation of this non gaap financial measure enhances an investor s ability to make period to period comparisons of the company s operating results 
this information should be considered in addition to the results presented in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered a substitute for the gaap results 
factors that may affect operating results and financial condition the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent on the company s ability to increase demand for the fc female condom and to cost effectively manufacture it in sufficient quantities to meet demand 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future results and improve its financial condition 
reliance on a single product the company expects to derive the vast majority  if not all  of its future revenues from the fc female condom  its sole current product 
while management believes the global potential for the fc female condom is significant  the ultimate level of consumer demand around the world is not yet known 
distribution network the company s strategy is to develop a global distribution network for fc by entering into partnership arrangements with financially secure companies with appropriate marketing expertise 
this strategy has resulted in numerous in country distributions in the public sector  particularly in africa  latin america and india 
the company has also entered into several partnership agreements for the commercialization of the fc female condoms fc and fc in consumer sector markets around the world 
however  the company is dependent on country governments  global donors  as well as us municipal and state public health departments to continue aids hiv sti prevention programs that include fc as a component of such programs 
the company s commercial market penetration is dependent on its ability to identify appropriate business partners who will effectively market and distribute fc within its contractual territory 
failure by the company s partners to successfully market and distribute the fc female condom or failure of donors and or country governments to establish and sustain hiv aids prevention programs which include distribution of female condoms  the company s inability to secure additional agreements with global aids prevention organizations  or the company s inability to secure agreements in new markets  either in the public or private sectors  could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
inventory and supply all of the key components for the manufacture of the fc female condom are essentially available from either multiple sources or multiple locations within a source 
global market and foreign currency risks the company manufactured fc in a leased facility located in london  england and manufactures fc in a leased facility located in malaysia 
although a material portion of the company s future sales are likely to be in foreign markets  fc sales are denominated in us dollars only 
manufacturing costs are subject to normal currency risks associated with changes in the exchange rate of the malaysian ringgit relative to the united states dollar 
on an ongoing basis  management continues to evaluate its commercial transactions and is prepared to employ currency hedging strategies when it believes such strategies are appropriate 
such factors may adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation the fc female condoms are subject to regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act  and by other state and foreign regulatory agencies 
under the fdc act  medical devices must receive fda clearance before they can be sold 
fda regulations also require the company to adhere to certain current good manufacturing practices  which include testing  quality control and documentation procedures 
the company s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspections by the fda 
the failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in fines  delays or suspensions of clearances  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions  withdrawal of fda approval and criminal prosecutions 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a withdrawal of approval from the fda

now completed  the expansion increased capacity from approximately million units annually to approximately million units annually 
the company self funded the expansion from existing cash and cash generated from operations 
the company believes its current cash position is adequate to fund operations of the company in the near future  although no assurances can be made that such cash will be adequate 
however  the company may sell equity securities to raise additional capital and may borrow funds under its heartland bank credit facility 
the company renewed two revolving notes with heartland bank  which will expire july   that allow the company to borrow up to  these notes were extended under the same terms as the initial notes dated may   with the exception of the interest rate which has been reduced to base rate plus  with an interest rate minimum of 
no new warrants were issued as part of the extension of these notes 
these notes are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving notes at september  as of december   the company had approximately million in cash  net trade accounts receivable of million and current trade accounts payable of million 
presently  the company has no required debt service obligations
