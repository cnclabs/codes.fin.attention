item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  our discussion begins with our assessment of the condition of the north american trailer industry along with a summary of the actions we have taken to strengthen wabash 
we then analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business and our operations segments  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  capital markets events and transactions  our credit facility and contractual commitments 
we also provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
these are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recent accounting pronouncements that we adopted during the year  as well as those not yet adopted that are expected to have an impact on our financial accounting practices 
we have two reportable segments manufacturing and retail and distribution 
the manufacturing segment produces trailers that are sold to customers who purchase trailers directly or through independent dealers and to the retail and distribution segment 
the retail and distribution segment includes the sale of new and used trailers  as well as the sale of aftermarket parts and service through our retail branch network 
executive summary our results reflect the challenges that the trailer industry faced during the year 
throughout the year  the factors negatively impacting demand for new trailers became more intense and pervasive across the united states 
as a result  the already difficult conditions within the industry became progressively more challenging 
high commodity prices and elevated fuel costs prevailed for most of the year  combined with a weak housing market and overall weak consumer confidence 
the effects of these factors were further magnified by credit tightening and severe shortages of liquidity in the financial markets 
the liquidity shortage has caused concern about the viability of many financial institutions and has negatively impacted the economy 
these factors combined together caused our revenue and gross profits to be significantly reduced 
despite these adverse conditions  we were able to achieve strong safety performance  improved process yield and productivity  increased market share and diversification through the acquisition of certain benson manufacturing assets and the successful product launch of portable storage containers 
due to the declining market conditions discussed above  we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill and net deferred tax assets 
our goodwill and net deferred tax asset evaluations reflected our expectation of continued and increasing challenges in the trailer industry  and our belief that these challenging conditions will persist for some time 
based on our evaluations  and as a result of our fourth quarter results and market values  we recorded a significant non cash impairment charge for goodwill and a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  which materially affected our operating results during we expect the overall trailer market for to decline further from as a result  we will focus on rightsizing our manufacturing and retail operations to match the current demand environment  implementing cost savings initiatives  strengthening our capital structure and improving liquidity  improving earnings and selective production introductions that meet the needs of our customers 
going concern due to the events of default under our second amended and restated loan and security agreement revolving facility  which are discussed in liquidity and capital resources below  we have classified all amounts outstanding under our revolving facility as a current liability in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as a result of this  the adverse conditions in the economy in general and the trailer industry in particular  and the other factors discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph with respect to substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our consolidated financial statements 
the presence of the going concern explanatory paragraph may have an adverse impact on our relationship with third parties with whom we do business  
table of contents including our customers  vendors and employees and could make it challenging and difficult for us to raise additional debt or equity financing to the extent needed  all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
strategic alternatives the board of directors has authorized management to pursue and evaluate a wide range of strategic alternatives  including  but not limited to  select business divestitures  changes to our capital structure  or a possible sale  merger or other business combination 
there can be no assurance that this evaluation will result in any specific transaction 
operating performance we measure our operating performance in four key areas safety environmental  quality  productivity and cost reduction 
our objective of being better today than yesterday and better tomorrow than we are today is simple  straightforward and easily understood by all our associates 
safety environmental 
we have made improvements to our total recordable incident rate resulting in a reduction in our workers compensation costs in compared to we maintain iso registration of our environmental management system 
we believe that our improved environmental  health and safety management translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a result of less time away from work and improved system management 
quality 
we monitor product quality on a continual basis through a number of means for both internal and external performance as follows internal performance 
our primary internal quality measurement is process yield py 
py is a performance metric that measures the impact of all aspects of the business on our ability to ship trailers at the end of the production process 
in  quality expectations were increased while maintaining py performance and reducing rework 
external performance 
we actively measure and track our warranty claims and costs 
early life cycle warranty claims are trended for performance monitoring and have shown a steady improvement from an average of approximately claims per trailers in to claims per trailers in this information is utilized  along with other data  to drive continuous improvement initiatives relative to product quality and reliability 
through these efforts  we continue to realize improved quality  which has resulted in a sustained decrease for warranty payments over the past four years 
productivity 
we measure productivity on many fronts 
some key indicators include production line speed  man hours per trailer and inventory levels 
improvements over the last several years in these areas have translated into significant improvements in our ability to better manage inventory flow and control costs 
cost reduction 
we believe continuous improvement ci is a fundamental component of our operational excellence focus 
in  we focused on productivity enhancements within manufacturing assembly and sub assembly areas through developing the capability for mixed model production 
we also established a central warehousing and distribution center to improve material flow  inventory levels and inventory accuracy within our supply chain 
the final components of the warehousing consolidation project were completed in the end of the first quarter  thus realizing significant savings in the supply chain operation 
we deployed value engineering and analysis teams to improve product and process costs thus keeping us competitive in the marketplace 
in  we also took actions to reduce costs by temporarily slowing down production at some of our facilities  extending normal shutdown periods and reducing salaried headcount levels 
we deployed an operational excellence strategy to enhance a culture of daily continuous improvement 
we believe the improvements generated to date provide the flexibility needed to support our customers as well as provide the foundation for enhanced performance going forward 

table of contents industry trends truck transportation in the us  according to the ata  was estimated to be a billion industry in  representing about of us gross domestic product 
ata estimates that approximately of all freight tonnage is carried by trucks at some point during its shipment 
trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported 
to monitor the state of the industry  we evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and the transportation industry 
recent trends we have observed include the following transportation trailer cycle 
transportation  including trucking  is a cyclical industry that has experienced three cycles over the last years 
truck freight tonnage  according to ata statistics  has been negative year over year from mid through most of even though tonnage volumes increased year over year in  recent data shows further weakening of freight tonnage 
the trailer industry generally precedes transportation industry cycles 
the current cycle began in early when industry shipments totaled approximately  reached a peak in with shipments of approximately  and  based on current act estimates  is expected to reach the bottom in according to act  shipments in amounted to approximately  units and will be approximately  and  in and  respectively 
our view is generally consistent with that of act 
age of trailer fleets 
during the three year period ending december  the latest such information available  the average age of the top publicly traded truckload motor carrier trailer fleets increased from years to years 
however  the average age of the total population during this same period remained relatively unchanged at approximately years  increasing to years for the stability of overall fleet age suggests a replacement demand estimated at  per year 
new trailer orders 
according to act  quarterly industry order placement rates have experienced year over year declines in each of the last nine quarters through the quarter ended december  total trailer orders in were  units  a decrease from the  units ordered in other developments 
other developments and our view of their potential impact on the industry include us federal truck emission regulations took effect on january   resulting in cleaner  yet less fuel efficient and more costly tractor engines 
trucking companies accelerated purchases of tractors prior to the effective date of the regulation  significantly reducing the historical trailer to tractor ratio 
in  additional emission regulations are scheduled to take effect which may result in reoccurrence of accelerated truck purchases  again reducing the trailer to tractor ratio 
we believe that on average the trailer to tractor ratio is unlikely to return to prior historic norms 
continuing improvements in trailer quality and durability resulting from technological advances like duraplate composite  as well as increased trailer utilization due to growing adoption of trailer tracking could result in reduced trailer demand 
trucking company profitability  which can be influenced by factors such as fuel prices  freight tonnage volumes  and government regulations  is highly correlated with the overall economy of the us decreases in trucker profitability reduce the demand for  and financial ability to purchase  new trailers 
truck driver shortages experienced over the past several years have constrained and are expected to continue to constrain freight market capacity growth 
as a result  trucking companies are under increased pressure to look for alternative ways to move freight  leading to more intermodal freight movement 
we believe that railroads are at or near capacity  which will limit their ability to grow 
we therefore expect that the majority of freight will still be moved by truck

impairment of goodwill we reviewed our goodwill during the fourth quarter of and  based on a combination of factors  including the significant decline in our market capitalization as well as the current decline in the us economy  we concluded that indicators of potential impairment were present 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of a two step process 
the first step requires us to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
during the fourth quarter  we completed a valuation of the fair value of our reporting units that incorporated existing market based considerations as well as discounted cash flows based on current and projected results 
based on this evaluation  it was determined that the carrying value of both our platform trailer and wood product manufacturing operations exceeded fair value 
the second step involves determining an implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill as compared to its carrying value 
after calculating the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit  it was determined that the recorded goodwill of million was fully impaired 
based on these facts and circumstances  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment of million

table of contents liquidity and capital resources capital structure we continue to assess our financial position and liquidity requirements in light of recent and ongoing economic conditions that have negatively impacted our operating results and caused instability in the capital markets 
as part of this process  we have been negotiating amendments to our revolving facility 
while we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our revolving facility at december   subsequent to year end  events of default have occurred under the revolving facility which permits the lenders to increase the interest on the outstanding principal by  to cause an acceleration of the maturity of borrowings  to restrict advances and to terminate the revolving facility 
we are negotiating a forbearance agreement with our lenders to address the consequences of the default and to provide additional liquidity while we continue discussions to amend the revolving facility and to waive any events of default 
there can be no assurance that a forbearance agreement will be entered into or that an amendment or waiver will be obtained 
based on these events  the company has classified its obligations outstanding under the revolving facility as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  further  our board of directors authorized management to pursue and evaluate a wide range of strategic alternatives including  but not limited to  select business divestures  changes to our capital structure  or a possible sale  merger  or business combination 
there can be no assurance this evaluation will result in any specific transaction 
today  our capital structure is comprised of a mix of equity and debt 
as of december   our debt to equity ratio was approximately the increase in our debt to equity ratio as compared to our ratio a year earlier is primarily due to the increase in our retained deficit resulting from losses in our long term objective is to generate operating cash flows sufficient to fund normal working capital requirements  to fund capital expenditures  to be positioned to take advantage of market opportunities and to fund potential dividends or stock repurchases 
for we expect to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures through cash flows from operations as well as available borrowings under our revolving facility 
we utilized our revolving facility in primarily to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes that matured 
debt agreements on march   we entered into the revolving facility with our lenders 
the revolving facility replaced our prior facility 
as amended the revolving facility has a capacity of million  subject to a borrowing base  with a maturity date of march  while we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the revolving facility at december   subsequent to year end  events of default have occurred under the revolving facility which permits the lenders to increase the interest on the outstanding principal by  to cause an acceleration of the maturity of borrowings  to restrict advances  and to terminate the revolving facility 
on april   we received written notice from the administrative agent for the revolving facility asserting the existence of events of default under the revolving facility relating to the failure to deliver the required financial statements  failure to deliver notice of the change in name of a company subsidiary  and requests for borrowings during the pendency of an event of default 
in accordance with the terms of the revolving facility  as of april   the agent has increased the interest on the outstanding principal under the revolving facility by and implemented availability reserves that result in a reduction of our borrowing base by million 
in addition to the events of default for which the agent has already provided notice  on april   we also incurred an event of default related to our borrowing capacity and fixed charge coverage ratio 
our revolving facility contains a financial covenant that provides that when our available borrowing capacity drops below million  we are subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of as a result of draws on april   our available borrowing capacity is now below million and we do not meet the fixed charge coverage ratio requirements 
furthermore  because the report of our independent registered public accounting firm contained in this form k includes an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern  we have incurred an additional event of default 
our revolving facility provides that as a result of the events of default identified in the written notice of the administrative agent  as well as the other events of defaults referenced above  our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
while the administrative agent s notice did not terminate the revolving facility or demand immediate repayment of any outstanding debt and the payment of accrued interest thereunder  it does reserve the rights of the 
table of contents lenders to do any of the foregoing or seek any other available remedies 
there can be no assurance that these actions will not occur at any time as a result of the events of default referenced in the notice or the occurrence of other events of default 
we are in discussions with the lenders concerning the events of default and negotiation of a forbearance agreement to address the consequences of the defaults and to provide additional liquidity while we continue discussions to amend the revolving facility and to waive any events of default 
there can be no assurance that a forbearance agreement will be entered into or that an amendment or waiver will be obtained 
the revolving facility provides an option to increase the credit facility by up to an additional million during the term of the facility  subject to a borrowing base and so long as no event of default is continuing and we have a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of for the month period prior to such increase 
the lenders under the revolving facility are under no obligation to provide any additional commitments and any increase in commitments will be subject to customary conditions precedent 
furthermore  we are currently discussing amendments to the revolving facility that would reduce the capacity under the revolving facility 
interest rate and fees 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option  either a base rate determined as bank of america  na s prime rate for commercial loans  or a libor rate determined on the basis of the offered rates for deposits in us dollars  for a period of time comparable to the applicable interest rate period  which appears on the telerate page as of am london time  on the day that is two london banking days preceding the first day of the interest period  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving facility ranges from to for base rate borrowings and to for libor borrowings  subject to adjustment based on the average availability under the revolving facility 
as noted above  during the pendency of an event of default  our lenders may and as previously mentioned have increased the interest on the outstanding principal by  and we have been notified by our lenders on april  that they have done so 
in addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the revolving facility  we are required to pay an annual agency fee to our administrative agent in the amount of  each year the revolving facility is outstanding other than the first year 
we are also required to pay an unused line fee equal to on the unused portion of the revolving facility and other customary fees 
mandatory repayments 
if we receive proceeds from the sale of any collateral or certain other dispositions  we are required to repay a sum equal to of the net proceeds including insurance payments but net of costs and taxes incurred in connection with the sale or event 
if we issue any additional indebtedness  we are required to repay a sum equal to of the net proceeds of the issuance of the indebtedness 
if we issue equity other than certain customary exceptions  we are required to repay a sum equal to of the net proceeds of the issuance 
further  if we receive proceeds from any tax refunds  indemnity payments or pension plan reversions  we are required to repay a sum equal to of the proceeds 
any repayment shall be applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance of the revolving facility but shall not permanently reduce the capacity to borrow under the facility 
if an event of default has occurred  we may be required to repay the outstanding balance under the revolving facility  together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other fees and obligations accrued thereunder 
voluntary repayments 
we may repay the outstanding balance under the revolving facility from time to time without premium or penalty other than customary breakage costs with respect to libor loans 
in addition  we may opt to reduce the capacity under the revolving facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed million during the term of the revolving facility 
upon days prior written notice  we may terminate the revolving facility if we have satisfied all outstanding obligations under the revolving facility and cash collateralized any outstanding letters of credit and letters of credit guaranties 
guarantees and security 
certain of our subsidiaries unconditionally guarantee all obligations under the revolving facility 
all obligations under the revolving facility  and the guarantees of those obligations  are 
table of contents secured  subject to certain exceptions  by a first priority security interest in  or pledge of  certain personal and real property of the company and certain direct and indirect subsidiaries  including inventory  accounts receivable  certain investment property  shares of capital stock in each domestic subsidiary  general intangibles  intellectual property  certain security and deposit accounts and certain related assets and proceeds of the foregoing 
certain covenants and events of default 
the revolving facility includes certain covenants that restrict  among other things and subject to certain exceptions  our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt  pay any distributions  including dividends on our common stock in excess of million per year  so long as no event of default is continuing  repurchase our common stock if  among other conditions  immediately after the repurchase we have availability of less than million under the revolving facility  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  make certain investments  loans  mergers and acquisitions  enter into material transactions with affiliates unless in the ordinary course  upon fair and reasonable terms and no less favorable than would be obtained in a comparable arms length transaction  use proceeds from the revolving facility to make payment on certain indebtedness  amend the terms of certain indebtedness  sell  lease or dispose of certain assets  amend our organizational documents in certain circumstances  enter into operating leases with aggregate rentals payable in excess of million during any consecutive months  change in any material respect the nature of our business conducted as of march   and create certain liens 
availability under the revolving facility has been impacted negatively in light of the current market demand for trailers 
as discussed above  the revolving facility provides that if our available borrowing capacity drops below million  we are subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  which could limit our ability to make capital expenditures and impact our operations 
this ratio is based on a factor of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda adjusted for various items  included but not limited to the charges for impairment of fixed or intangible assets  expenses for stock based compensation  income taxes  capital expenditures and distributions for any stock repurchases or dividends compared with the total of payments made for scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  including capital lease obligations  and interest expense 
at december   we were in compliance with this covenant of the revolving facility as our availability was approximately million 
however  as a result of draws on april   our availability fell below million  and we do not meet the fixed charge coverage ratio requirements 
as a result  our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our revolving facility  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
the revolving facility contains additional customary affirmative covenants and events of default  including among other events  certain cross defaults  business disruption  condemnation  change in ownership and failure to deliver an unqualified opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  a material adverse effect clause  which permits the lenders to subjectively determine when a material adverse change in our business or financial condition occurs  could result in an event of default and an early termination of our revolving facility 
on july   the company entered into a three year capital lease for a manufacturing facility located in cadiz  kentucky 
the lease includes a bargain purchase option 
as of december   the present value of future minimum lease payments totaled million with annual minimum payments of million  million and million for the years ending  and  respectively  including interest of approximately million 

table of contents cash flow cash provided by operating activities for amounted to million compared to million in the change was primarily a result of a million improvement in working capital offset by a million reduction in net income  adjusted for non cash items 
the following is a discussion of factors impacting certain working capital items compared to the prior year accounts receivable decreased million during compared to a decrease of million in the decrease for is due to a reduction in sales volumes and improved collections 
days sales outstanding  a measure of working capital efficiency that measures the amount of time a receivable is outstanding  improved to approximately days in compared to days in inventory decreased million during compared to a decrease of million in the decrease is due to lower new trailer inventories resulting from reduced demand and continued improvements in inventory management 
inventory turns  a commonly used measure of working capital efficiency that measures how quickly inventory turns per year  was approximately seven times in both and accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased million in compared to a decrease of million in prior year change was primarily due to reduced raw material levels  improved inventory management and lower production volumes 
investing activities used million in compared to million used in the prior year period 
the period includes million used to acquire certain equipment from benson international llc  a manufacturer of aluminum flatbeds  dump trailers and other truck bodies 
the period included an additional million purchase price payment based on transcraft s achievement of performance targets 
financing activities used million during as borrowings under the revolving facility were used to purchase and retire million of senior convertible notes 
on december   the company announced that it would suspend the payment of dividends to conserve cash and expand liquidity in a period of economic uncertainty 
as of december   our liquidity position  defined as cash on hand and available borrowing capacity  amounted to approximately million and total debt and capital lease obligations amounted to approximately million 
this amount has been adversely impacted by the events of default under our revolving facility and resulting actions of our lenders 
any amendment to our revolving facility may also result in a lower level of liquidity 
our liquidity remains constrained such that it may not be sufficient to meet our cash operating needs in this period of economic uncertainty 
our ability to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures is limited by the net cash provided by operations  cash on hand and the liquidity available under the revolving facility 
additional declines in net cash provided by operations  further decreases in the availability under the revolving facility or changes in the credit our suppliers provide to us  could rapidly exhaust our liquidity 
our liquidity problems have worsened as a result of the events of default under our revolving facility 
there is no assurance that we will be able to enter into a forbearance agreement under our revolving facility 
and  even if we are able to enter into a forbearance agreement  an amendment and waiver will also be necessary under our revolving facility 
there can be no assurance that a forbearance agreement will be entered into or that an amendment or waiver will be obtained 
in order to increase our liquidity  a forbearance agreement and amendment and waiver to our revolving facility will likely not be enough 
we will likely need to issue new common equity  preferred equity  or obtain modification to  or additional sources of  debt 
any new issuance may take the form of public or private offerings for debt or equity 
our ability to obtain additional liquidity will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results  and general economic and capital market conditions 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 

table of contents in light of current uncertain market and economic conditions  we are aggressively managing our cost structure  capital expenditures and cash position 
in  we implemented additional cost reduction actions that will substantially decrease our corporate overhead and operating costs to include salaried workforce headcount reductions of approximately associates  or  bringing total salaried headcount reductions to over  or approximately associates  since the beginning of the industry downturn in early  a reduction in base salary for executive officers  a temporary reduction of of annualized base salary for all remaining exempt level salaried associates  combined with a reduction in the standard work week for most from hours to hours  a temporary reduction in the standard paid work week from hours to hours for all non exempt associates  a temporary reduction in hourly wages  a temporary suspension of the k company match  the introduction of a voluntary unpaid layoff program with continuation of benefits  and  the continued close regulation of the work day and headcount of hourly associates 
these actions were substantially complete and in effect by february   and are incremental to previous actions taken during this downturn 
previous actions included idling of plants and assembly lines  consolidation and transformation initiatives at our lafayette facility  salaried workforce reductions  reductions in total compensation awards to executives and other eligible participants  the suspension of any company match for non qualified plan participants  as well as the suspension of our quarterly dividend 
capital expenditures capital spending amounted to million during  including million for the assets purchased on july  from benson international llc  and is anticipated to be approximately million for the spending for will be limited to required maintenance and cost reduction initiatives in efforts to manage cash flows and enhance liquidity 
off balance sheet transactions as of december   we had approximately million in operating lease commitments 
we did not enter into any material off balance sheet debt or operating lease transactions during the year 
outlook we face significant uncertainty regarding the demand for trailers during the current economic environment 
according to the most recent act estimates  total trailer industry shipments for are expected to be down from to approximately  units 
act estimates that shipments in will grow to approximately  units 
the biggest concerns going into relate to the global economy  especially credit markets  as well as the continued decline in housing and construction related markets in the us management s expectation is that the trailer industry will remain challenging throughout and  as a result  it is likely that we will incur net losses in  which will further reduce our stockholders equity 
by product type  act is estimating that van trailer shipments will be down approximately in compared to act is forecasting that platform trailer shipments will decline approximately and dump trailer shipments will fall approximately in the decrease in the demand for trailers reflects the weakness of truck freight  which has trended down since the latter part of as a result of general economic conditions and  more particularly  declines in new home construction and the automotive industry 

table of contents we believe we are well positioned in the industry because our core customers are among the dominant participants in the trucking industry  our duraplate trailer continues to have increased market acceptance  our focus is on developing solutions that reduce our customers trailer maintenance costs  and we expect some expansion of our presence into the mid market carriers 
in  we added approximately new mid market customers accounting for orders of over new trailers 
since implementing our mid market sales strategy five years ago  we have added new mid market customers accounting for orders of approximately  new trailers 
pricing will be difficult in due to weak demand and fierce competitive activity 
raw material and component costs are expected to be volatile based on world commodity prices for oil  steel  and aluminum 
as has been our policy  we will endeavor to pass along raw material and component price increases to our customers 
we have a focus on continuing to develop innovative new products that both add value to our customers operations and allow us to continue to differentiate our products from the competition to increase profitability 
based on industry forecasts  along with conversations with our customers regarding their requirements  and assuming we maintain our current market share  we estimate that for the full year total units will be between  and  a to reduction from contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of payments of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  both on and off balance sheet  as of december  are as follows in millions thereafter total debt revolving facility capital lease including principal and interest total debt other operating leases total other other commercial commitments letters of credit purchase commitments residual guarantees total other commercial commitments total obligations residual guarantees represent commitments related to certain new trailer sales transactions prior to  where we had entered into agreements to guarantee end of term residual value 
the agreements also contain an option for us to purchase the used equipment at a predetermined price 
we have purchase options of million on the aforementioned trailers 
operating leases represent the total future minimum lease payments 
we have million in purchase commitments through december for aluminum  which is within normal production requirements 

table of contents significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the table below presents information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions balance sheet caption item required approaches used key factors other accrued liabilities and other non current liabilities warranty estimating warranty requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold 
we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims  recall campaigns and discussions with our customers 
failure rates and estimated repair costs accounts receivable  net allowance for doubtful accounts estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to estimate the financial capability of customers to pay for products 
we base our estimates on historical experience  the time an account is outstanding  customer s financial condition and information from credit rating services 
customer financial condition inventories lower of cost or market write downs we evaluate future demand for products  market conditions and incentive programs 
estimates are based on recent sales data  historical experience  external market analysis and third party appraisal services 
market conditions product type property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible assets  and other assets valuation of long lived assets and investments we are required periodically to review the recoverability of certain of our assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows  including future profitability assessments of various product lines 
we estimate cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data  and independent trailer production volume estimates 
future production estimates discount rate deferred income taxes recoverability of deferred tax assets in particular  net operating loss carry forwards we are required to estimate whether recoverability of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings 
we use projected future operating results  based upon our business plans  including a review of the eligible carry forward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
variances in future projected profitability  including by taxing entity tax law changes in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the fair market value of new and used trailers is subject to variation  particularly in times of rapidly changing market conditions 
a change in the valuation of our inventories would be approximately million

as a result  inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  a significant impact on our business 
new accounting pronouncements derivative instruments and hedging activities in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
the statement requires enhanced disclosures for derivative and hedging activities  including information that would enable financial statement users to understand how and why a company uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  and will be applicable to our financial statements beginning in the first quarter of as sfas no 
only requires enhanced disclosures  we do not anticipate that this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
the statement provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities 
it does not expand the use of fair value measurement 
in february  the fasb announced that it was deferring the effective date to fiscal years beginning after november  for certain non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
for these financial and non financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured at least annually  this statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted sfas no 
for financial and non financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured at least annually which for us represented derivative instruments and hedging activities which are carried at fair value 
the adopted provision of sfas no 
has not and the deferred adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fair value for derivative instruments 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we have exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks we are exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and polyethylene 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
historically  we have managed aluminum price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with our suppliers 
as of december   we had million in raw material purchase commitments through december for materials that will be used in the production process 
we typically do not set prices for our products more than days in advance of our commodity purchases and can  subject to competitive market conditions  take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents b 
interest rates during  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that fixed a portion of our underlying variable rate borrowings under our revolving facility at rates of and 
this compares to the variable rate of the three month libor plus the applicable margin set forth within the revolving facility 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements entered into totaled million with million expiring in september and the remaining million expiring in october based on amounts outstanding at december   after taking into account the effect of the interest rate swap agreement if the interest rate on our variable rate debt were to change by a hypothetical basis points  the interest expense over a one year period would change by approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes
