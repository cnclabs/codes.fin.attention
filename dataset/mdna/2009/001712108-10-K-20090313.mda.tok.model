overview amicas  inc we  us  our  amicas or the company is a leader in radiology and medical image and information management solutions 
the amicas one suitetm products provide a complete  end to end it solution for imaging centers  ambulatory care facilities  radiology practices and billing services 
solutions include automation support for workflow  imaging  billing and document management 
hospital customers are provided a comprehensive hospital information system his radiology information system ris independent picture archiving communication system pacs  featuring advanced enterprise workflow support and scalable design 
complementing the one suite product family is amicas professional services  a set of client centered professional and consulting services that assist the company s customers with a well planned transition to a digital enterprise 
the company is focused in two primary markets  ambulatory imaging businesses and acute care facilities 
the ambulatory imaging business is composed of radiology groups  teleradiology businesses  imaging centers  multi specialty groups and billing services 
acute care facilities consist primarily of integrated delivery networks idns and hospitals 
in the ambulatory imaging market  the company is focused on delivering an end to end solution 
our revenues in this market consist of software license fees and systems  services  maintenance  and edi revenues 
the end to end solution is modular and customers can purchase one component or several and add enhancements over time 
we believe radiology groups need an automation solution focused on improving their competitiveness  service delivery capabilities  and operating financial performance 
in fiscal year  the company saw a trend towards large multi site customers in the ambulatory market 
this trend has also recognized a shift from payment of the license fee in advance to a multi year financing arrangement where payments occur ratably over time 
we believe that this shift is due to the need for radiology groups to reduce the up front capital needs typically required in a traditional software sale 
we believe this trend had a negative impact in our revenues as a result of the need to recognize the revenue over extended periods 
software discounts have remained relatively constant during fiscal year  however  continued economic uncertainty could impact both the level of discounts as well as delay capital purchasing decisions 
revenues in the acute care market consist primarily of software and the associated maintenance and services 
we believe the acute care market continues to be driven by the replacement market for existing pacs systems  especially to reduce total cost of ownership and reduce overhead costs 
we believe the replacement market represents an attractive opportunity for our solution to improve return on investment and lower costs 
however  continued economic uncertainty could cause potential customers to delay or eliminate capital expenditures when they have an existing system 
results of operations revenues year ended december  change change dollars in thousands maintenance and services percentage of total revenues software licenses and system sales percentage of total revenues total revenues 
table of contents the company has two primary revenue generating areas software license fees and system revenues  and maintenance and services revenues 
software license fees and system revenues are derived from the sale of software product licenses and computer hardware 
maintenance and services revenues come from providing ongoing product support  implementation  training and edi 
approximately  and of our total revenues were of a recurring nature  such as support and transaction processing services  in  and  respectively 
maintenance and services revenues there are three primary components of maintenance and services revenues software and hardware maintenance  edi revenues  and service revenues 
maintenance and services revenues grew or million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the components of the change are software and hardware maintenance revenues increased approximately million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of the increase in the size of our installed customer base 
the growth in our installed customer base is dependent on our ability to sell software licenses and systems sales and to maintain our existing installed base through product upgrades and new and innovative features 
edi revenues increased approximately million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the growth in edi revenues was primarily the result of increases in our rates as volumes from customers for these services remained relatively constant 
service revenues decreased by approximately million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in service revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the number of agreements with extended payment terms  resulting in a longer time to recognize revenue 
maintenance and services revenues of million in fiscal year increased approximately million  or  from million in fiscal year this increase was due to a million increase in maintenance revenues  a million increase in edi services revenues and a million increase in third party product royalties offset by a decrease in implementation revenues 
the million increase in maintenance revenues was primarily the result of new customers and associated maintenance revenues offset by customer attrition 
the million increase in edi revenues was primarily the result of growth in the volumes processed by our customers and new edi customers 
software license and systems revenues software license and system revenues decreased or million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in software license and systems revenues is primarily attributable to the effect of extended payment terms  which increased our time to convert the order to software license and systems revenues by approximately 
software license and systems revenues are highly dependent on our product mix  such as large third party purchases or significant software license volumes to our customers  the level of software discounts  and software revenue recognition policies under generally accepted accounting principles  which can delay revenue recognition 
we believe our customers and potential customers continue to look for automation solutions as they try to grow their businesses 
underlying these trends is the public demand for non invasive diagnostic procedures and a public interest in health and fitness which we believe will continue to drive growth in the imaging industry 
we believe these trends support our end to end strategy and are consistent with our goal to approach the market with our amicas one suite product 
however we believe that there will be intense competition in this market as demand grows which can threaten our competitive position 
software license and system revenues of million in fiscal year decreased approximately million  or  from million in fiscal the decrease of million is due to a decrease of software licensing revenues of million and system revenues of million 
software license revenues 
table of contents decreased due to an increase in software discounting as well as a change in contracts terms  such as extended payments terms or per use pricing  that delay the recognition of software license fees 
systems revenue decreased due to customers electing to purchase hardware from other third party vendors 
quarterly and annual revenues and related operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of the signing of license agreements and product deliveries during each quarter  which are very difficult to forecast 
a significant portion of our quarterly sales of software product licenses and computer hardware is concluded in the last month of each quarter  generally with a concentration of our quarterly revenues earned in the final ten business days of that month 
also  our projections for revenues and operating results include significant sales of new product and service offerings  including our amicas pacs  amicas ris  amicas financials  radstream  dashboards and amicas documents 
due to these and other factors  our revenues and operating results are very difficult to forecast 
cost of revenues year ended december  change change dollars in thousands maintenance and services percentage of maintenance and services revenues software licenses and system sales percentage of software licenses and system sales total cost of revenues cost of maintenance and services revenues primarily consists of the external cost of edi insurance claims processing  outsourced hardware maintenance  edi billing and statement printing services  postage  third party consultants  billable travel and internal personnel salaries  benefits and other allocated indirect costs related to the delivery of services and maintenance 
cost of maintenance and services revenues cost of maintenance and services revenues increased by million to million or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year cost of software and hardware maintenance and services increased by approximately million 
the increase in cost of software and hardware maintenance and services is due primarily to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately million 
cost of edi revenues increased by approximately million 
the increase in edi costs is due primarily to a reduced cost in fiscal year  as the company recorded an approximately million reduction in cost of maintenance and services revenues for unearned discounts which were recognized in as a result of the termination of the agreement with cerner 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of maintenance and services revenues increased from to 
excluding the impact of the unearned discounts  the cost of maintenance and services as a percent of maintenance and services revenue decreased slightly in fiscal year versus fiscal year cost of maintenance and services revenues of million in fiscal year increased approximately million  or  from million in fiscal year this increase was primarily related to the increase in maintenance and services revenues  with an increase in salary  benefits and other allocated internal direct costs of approximately million and an increase of million in external cost for third party software and hardware maintenance 

table of contents cost of maintenance and services revenues of million in  represented of maintenance and services revenues versus million  or  of revenues in the increase in the percentage of maintenance and services revenue percentage of is due primarily to the increase in salary costs related to services and support 
cost of software license and system sales cost of software license and system revenues primarily consists of costs incurred to purchase computer hardware  third party software and other items for resale in connection with sales of new systems  as well as amortization of software product costs 
cost of software license and system sales increased by approximately million or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in cost of software license and system sales is attributable to million write off of third party costs that were previously capitalized and million increase in amortization of software costs related to the purchase of amicas financials  as described below 
cost of software license and system sales as a percentage of software license and system revenues increased to in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year amortization of software costs and the write off of third party costs represent approximately of the increase 
the remaining increase of approximately is due primarily to the product mix of software revenues versus systems sales 
cost of software license and system revenues of million in fiscal year decreased approximately million  or  from million in fiscal year this decrease was due to a decrease of million in computer hardware expenses offset by an increase of million in third party software fees 
during the period ended march   we acquired certain ownership rights to a practice management software application for million 
we now market this product as amicas financials 
amicas financials became commercially available in april  at which point we began amortization of the costs over the estimated life of approximately seven years  which is reflected in the cost of software license and systems revenue 
we did not capitalize any internal costs prior to commercial availability as such amounts were immaterial 
operating expenses year ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of total revenues research and development percentage of total revenues depreciation and amortization percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses include fixed and variable compensation and benefits  facilities  travel  communications  bad debt  legal  marketing  insurance  stock based compensation and other administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this decrease was due to a million decrease in personnel salaries and benefits due to reduced headcount and a million decrease in stock based compensation included in general and administrative expenses 
non personnel related expenses remained consistent with fiscal year 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to from as compared to fiscal year the decrease in selling and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is due primarily to the decrease in such expenses of million and an increase in revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal year increased  or from million in fiscal year this increase was due to a million increase in personnel salaries  benefits and related expenses offset by a reduction of other general and administrative expenses of million  primarily bad debt expense and accounting services 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to from in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues as general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat versus fiscal year on october   we notified our then president and chief operating officer coo that the employment agreement between our coo and us dated march  the employment agreement would not be renewed 
pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement and in connection with the non renewal by us of that agreement  we and our coo entered into a general release and separation agreement  dated as of october  the separation agreement 
pursuant to the separation agreement our coo was entitled to receive one year s salary as a severance payment 
in the year ended december   we accrued approximately million in general and administrative expenses related to this separation agreement 
the severance payments per the agreement were paid in fiscal year research and development research and development expenses include fixed and variable compensation and benefits  facilities  travel  communications  stock based compensation and other administrative expenses related to our research and development activities 
research and development expense increased from million to million or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in research and development expense represents operating increases in personnel costs and benefits 
the company continues to invest in research and development to develop new and innovative products and features and enhance the company s existing product suite 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses were of revenues in fiscal year as compared to of revenues in fiscal year  which reflects this continued investment 
research and development expense was million in  which represents a decrease of million  or  from million in fiscal year this decrease is due to a reduction in salaries and related personnel costs in the research and development area 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expense decreased slightly to in versus in the percentage decreased due to both decreased research and development costs and slightly higher revenues in versus depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased  in fiscal year versus fiscal year the decrease in depreciation and amortization related primarily to amortization of non compete agreements which ended in the fourth quarter of during fiscal year  the company invested approximately million in fixed assets  primarily computer equipment and a new phone system in our daytona location 
depreciation and amortization expenses of million  consisting of million related to fixed assets and million of amortization related to intangible assets  in fiscal year decreased approximately million  or  from million in fiscal year this decrease was the result of fixed assets that became fully depreciated during the fiscal year offset by increases in depreciation expense for new assets placed in service during during the period ended march   we acquired certain ownership rights to a practice management software application for million

we did not capitalize any internal costs prior to commercial availability as such amounts were immaterial 
impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred million of impairment charges of which million related to goodwill 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test at september  and determined that the fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity  therefore goodwill was not impaired as of that date 
subsequent to september   there were certain triggering events that required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test at december  these triggering events primarily include the duration of the decline of our stock price at a market value below the carrying value of equity from september  through december   and the continued deterioration of the credit markets and the economy in the fourth quarter  which negatively impacts our customers ability to obtain financing to purchase our products and services 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter  see note c to consolidated financial statements 
we also incurred a million charge related to internal use purchased software that we determined during the fourth quarter will not be utilized 
interest income expense year ended december  change change dollars in thousands interest income interest expense interest income decreased by approximately million or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in interest income is the result of the combination of i the decrease in cash and marketable securities as a result of our stock repurchase plan and ii lower yields on our investments due to the current economic climate 
we attribute approximately million of the decline in interest income to the change in cash balances and the remaining million due to lower yields 
the increase in interest income in of million  or  versus fiscal year is the result of increased marketable securities and cash balances as we generated cash from operations in  and the excess cash was reinvested 
we had no interest expense during or income taxes in fiscal year we recorded an income tax provision of approximately  the provision decreased versus fiscal year by approximately  the income tax provision in fiscal year is the result of state franchise tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions 
we did not record a federal tax provision as we did not have federal taxable income in fiscal year for  we recorded an income tax provision of  from continuing operations 
for  we recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of  and a benefit of  related to discontinued operations 
the increase in our tax provision in resulted primarily from accrued interest and penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions 
management has assessed the recovery of our deferred tax assets of million and as a result of this assessment  recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  the valuation allowance  along with deferred tax liabilities of million  reduces the net deferred tax asset to zero 
a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred tax asset since management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources on december   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were million  a decrease of million from million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  this decrease was primarily to fund our stock repurchase plan in net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year as compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal year net cash from operations in fiscal year included approximately million of cash generated from changes in working capital  primarily an increase of million of deferred revenue  offset by a decrease of million related to accounts payable 
net loss  after adjusting for non cash items of million of amortization  million of depreciation  million of goodwill impairment charges  million of stock based compensation and million of bad debt expense generated approximately million of cash from operations 
in fiscal year our product mix included a higher percentage of term deals than in fiscal year continued pressure from our customers and potential customers to provide structured term deals could impact our cash provided from operations in the short term 
however  we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be sufficient to meet our working capital needs 
net cash provided by investing activities provided million of cash in fiscal year we decreased our marketable securities balances by approximately million and invested million in fixed assets during fiscal year net cash used in financing activities was million 
the primary use of cash related to million used to fund our stock repurchase programs which were authorized by our board of directors in december and november the primary source of cash used to fund these repurchases was the sale of our marketable securities  with the remainder provided by working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in as compared to million in the million increase of cash provided by operating activities resulted from increases in changes in operating assets and liabilities  consisting of increases from prepaid expenses  accounts payable  accrued expenses  and unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million  offset by operating decreases in deferred revenue  and accounts receivable of million  offset by an increase of million from net income and adjustments to net income 
investing activities utilized net cash of million in compared to net cash utilized of million in in  our cash equivalents of million were invested in marketable securities 
the net cash utilized of million reflects additional investments in marketable securities of million and million in net cash used for capital expenditures and the purchase of software 
cash used in financing activities for totaled million  consisting of million of cash used to repurchase our common stock  offset by million of cash received in connection with the exercise of stock options by certain employees 
our primary source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash provided by operations  will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the payments due in connection with specific contractual obligations during the periods specified 
fiscal year ended thereafter totals in thousands operating leases a other commitments b total 
table of contents a in october  we signed a lease to remain in our boston  massachusetts corporate headquarters until january the base rent is  per month and increases by per square foot annually over the lease term 
in february  we extended the lease in our daytona beach  florida facility from may to april the base rent of  begins in may and increases by  per month in the second year and an additional per month in the third year 
b included in other commitments are the following we are committed to paying approximately  per month through april for certain edi services 
in connection with our employee savings plans  we have committed  for the plan year  to contribute to the plans 
our matching contribution for is estimated to be approximately million in cash 
our matching contribution for was approximately million of which million was paid in and million was paid in february in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
as of december   we have repurchased  shares for approximately million under a rule b trading plan 
we anticipate capital expenditures for computer software and equipment  other equipment  and leasehold improvements of approximately million for to date  the overall impact of inflation on us has not been material 
from time to time  in the normal course of business  we are involved with disputes and have various claims made against us 
there are no material proceedings to which we are a party currently pending  and management is unaware of any material contemplated actions against us 
as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements under which we indemnify our executive officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
given the insurance coverage in effect  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we generally include intellectual property indemnification provisions in our software license agreements 
pursuant to these provisions  we hold harmless and agree to defend the indemnified party  generally our business partners and customers  in connection with certain patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret infringement claims by third parties with respect to our products 
the term of the indemnification provisions varies and may be perpetual 
in the event an infringement claim against us or an indemnified party is made  generally we  in our sole discretion  agree to do one of the following i procure for the indemnified party the right to continue use of the software  ii provide a modification to the software so that its use becomes noninfringing  iii replace the software with software which is substantially similar in functionality and performance  or iv refund all or the residual value of the software license fees paid by the indemnified party for the infringing software 
we believe the estimated fair value of these intellectual property indemnification agreements is minimal 
we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements and accompanying notes  which we believe have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for future returns  discounts and bad debts  tangible and intangible assets  deferred costs  income taxes  restructurings  commitments  contingencies  claims and litigation 
we base our judgments and 
table of contents estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop with respect to certain transactions  sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain performance type contracts and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab and eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we recognize software license revenues and system computer hardware sales upon execution of the sales contract and delivery of the software off the shelf application software and or hardware 
in all cases  however  the fee must be fixed or determinable  collection of any related receivable must be considered probable  and no significant post contract obligations of ours shall be remaining 
otherwise  we defer the sale until all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
maintenance fees for routine client support and unspecified product updates are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangement 
we review all contracts that are offered outside our standard payment terms 
we review customer credit history to determine probability of collection and we do not have a history of granting post contract concessions 
when there is a history of successfully collecting payments from our customer without making post contract concessions  we recognize revenue upon delivery 
in instances where we do not have an established payment history and or if the payment terms are in excess of twelve months we recognize revenue as payments become due and payable 
our license and service arrangements generally do not require significant customization or modification of our software products to meet specific customer needs 
in those limited instances that do require significant modification  including significant changes to our software products source code or where there are acceptance criteria or milestone payments  we defer the recognition of software license revenue 
in instances where we have determined that services are essential to the functionality  we recognize the services revenues and software license and systems revenues according to sop using the percentage of completion method 
most of our sales and licensing contracts involve multiple elements  in which case  we allocate the total value of the customer arrangement to each element based on the vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of its fair value of the respective elements 
the residual method is used to determine revenue recognition with respect to a multiple element arrangement when vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements eg  implementation  training and maintenance services  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the contract eg  computer software or hardware 
vsoe of fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered element s of an arrangement  the total value of the customer arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element s is delivered or until vsoe of its fair value is established 
in our contracts and arrangements with our customers  we generally do not include acceptance provisions  which would give the customer the right to accept or reject the product after we ship it 
however  if an acceptance provision is included  revenue is recognized upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenues using contract accounting if payment of the software license fees is dependent upon the performance of consulting services or the consulting services are otherwise essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
in these instances we allocate the contract value to services maintenance and services revenues based on list price  which is consistent with our vsoe defined in previous paragraph for such services  and the residual to product software licenses and systems sales in our consolidated statement of operations 
we generally determine the percentage of completion by comparing the labor hours incurred to date to the estimated total labor hours required to complete the project 
we consider labor hours to be the most reliable  available measure of progress on these projects 
adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known 
when the estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred  such loss is recorded in the period identified 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the percent complete of each contract 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 

table of contents recognition of revenues in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments that affect the timing and amount of reported revenues 
cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds and are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  which approximates cost 
marketable debt securities consist of high quality debt instruments  primarily us government  municipal and corporate obligations 
investments in corporate obligations are classified as held to maturity  as we have the intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
held to maturity marketable debt securities are reported at amortized cost 
investments in municipal obligations are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income 
marketable debt securities include held to maturity investments with remaining maturities of less than one year as of the balance sheet date and available for sale investments that may be sold in the current period or used in current operations 
accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms carried at their face value  less provisions for bad debts 
we evaluate the carrying amount of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and establish a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  including specific customer circumstances  historical rate of write offs and the past due status of the accounts 
at the end of each reporting period  the allowance is reviewed and analyzed for adequacy and is often adjusted based on the findings 
the allowance is increased through an increase in bad debt expense 
long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangible assets that are subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million charge related to internal use purchased software that is no longer utilized 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that  more likely than not  the fair value of such assets was less than the carrying value 
judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  significant changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
the first step defined as step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the equity with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the equity exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we performed a step test at its annual testing date of september  and determined that the fair value of equity exceeding the carrying value of equity  therefore goodwill was not impaired 
subsequent to september   there were certain triggering events that required us to perform an interim step test at december  these triggering events primarily include the duration of the decline of our stock price at a market value below the carrying value of equity from september  through december   and the continued deterioration of the credit markets and the economy in the fourth quarter which negatively impacts our customers access to capital to purchase our products and services 
at december  we completed an interim step test utilizing the market approach 
the market approach considered the company s stock price to calculate the market capitalization of equity to compare to the 
table of contents carrying value of equity 
we selected a day moving average of the market value of equity to compare to the carrying value 
using the market approach  the carrying value of invested capital exceeded the market value by approximately 
the interim step test resulted in the determination that the carrying value of equity exceeded the fair value of equity  thus requiring us to measure the amount of any goodwill impairment by performing the second step of the impairment test 
an income approach was used to corroborate the interim step test 
the discounted cash flow method is used to measure the fair value of our equity under the income approach 
determining the fair value using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
our judgments are based upon historical experience  current market trends  pipeline for future sales  and other information 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome 
in estimating future cash flows  we relied on internally generated projections for a defined time period for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures  changes in net working capital  and adjustments for non cash items to arrive at the free cash flow available to invested capital 
a terminal value utilizing a constant growth rate of cash flows was used to calculate a terminal value after the explicit projection period 
the income approach supported the interim step test that resulted in the determination that the carrying value of equity exceeded the fair value of equity 
the second step defined as step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the guidance in sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  paragraph was used to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the company s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill shall be its new accounting basis 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied amount of goodwill 
we identified several intangible assets that were valued during this process  including technology  customer relationships  trade names  non compete agreements  and the company s workforce 
the allocation process was performed only for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
the step test resulted in the impairment of goodwill in an amount equal to its carrying value of million as of december  in addition  we performed sensitivity analysis on certain key assumptions in the step test including the discount rate  customer retention rates and royalty rates 
the net book value of our tangible net assets was approximately percent of the fair value of equity 
our tangible net assets were adjusted to reflect the fair value of deferred revenue 
in addition  the total tangible and intangible net assets  excluding the assembled workforce  were million or percent of the fair value of equity 
as a result  the assumptions included in the valuation of intangible assets would need to change significantly to avoid goodwill impairment 
software development costs 
we begin capitalizing software development costs  only after establishing commercial and technical feasibility 
annual amortization of these costs represents the greater of the amount computed using i the ratio that current gross revenues for the product s bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues of the product s  or ii the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product s  generally  depending on the nature and success of the product  such deferred costs are amortized over a five to seven year period 
amortization commences when the product is made commercially available 
no products were made commercially available in in and we did not capitalize any costs related to products that were made commercially available during the year  as such amounts were immaterial 
we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software based on estimated future gross revenues less the estimated cost of completing the products and of performing maintenance and product support 
if our gross revenues turn out to be significantly less than our estimates  the net realizable value of our capitalized software intended for sale would be impaired 

table of contents income taxes 
we provide for taxes based on current taxable income  and the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax carrying values of our assets and liabilities deferred income taxes 
at each reporting period  management assesses the realizable value of deferred tax assets based on  among other things  estimates of future taxable income  and adjusts the related valuation allowance as necessary

fin prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin and there has been no material effect on the financial statements 
as a result  there was no cumulative effect related to adopting fin accounting for share based payment 
we account for share based payment in accordance with sfas r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends  share price volatility and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims relating to labor  service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas allows companies to elect to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value the fair value option 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
if the fair value option is elected for an instrument  sfas specifies that all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument must be reported in earnings 
we are currently evaluating whether we will apply the voluntary fair value option to any of our financial assets or financial liabilities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
this statement replaces sfas no 
 but retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no 
that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
this statement requires an acquirer to recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values as of the acquisition date 
the statement requires acquisition costs and any restructuring costs associated with the business combination to be recognized separately from the fair value of the business combination 
sfas no 
r establishes requirements for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase as well as disclosure requirements designed to enable users to better interpret the results of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  early adoption of this statement is not permitted 
the adoption of sfas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted  but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
this statement changes the accounting and reporting for noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries and for deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
under the revised basis  the 
table of contents noncontrolling interest will be shown in the balance sheet as a separate line in equity instead of as a liability 
in the income statement  separate totals will be shown for consolidated net income including noncontrolling interest  noncontrolling interest as a deduction  and consolidated net income attributable to the controlling interest 
in addition  changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if a controlling financial interest is retained 
if a subsidiary is deconsolidated  the parent company will now recognize gain or loss to net income based on fair value of the noncontrolling equity at that date 
the statement is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position no 
fsp  which delays the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the delay is intended to allow the fasb and constituents additional time to consider the effect of various implementation issues that have arisen  or that may arise  from the application of sfas we do not expect the adoption of fsp to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as that term is defined in the rules and regulations of the sec 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe we are not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  as most of our sales and expenses are domestic and therefore are denominated in the us dollar 
we do not hold derivative securities and have not entered into contracts embedded with derivative instruments  such as foreign currency and interest rate swaps  options  forwards  futures  collars  and warrants  either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
as of december   we held approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable debt securities 
cash equivalents are carried at fair value  which approximates cost 
available for sale marketable securities are carried at fair value  and held to maturity securities are held at amortized cost 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments 
a significant decline in interest rates can have a material impact on our interest income 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment in marketable debt securities of million at december  we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and have policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
we manage potential losses in fair value by investing in relatively short term investments thereby allowing us to hold our investments to maturity 
the current negative liquidity conditions in the global credit markets can adversely impact the liquidity of these securities  however  the investments are highly rated  and our investments have an average remaining maturity of approximately six months and are primarily fixed rate debt instruments 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows are estimated to be
