risk factors 
general we manage investment assets and provide services for our clients through our two subsidiaries  westwood management corp 
westwood management and westwood trust 
westwood management provides investment advisory services to corporate retirement plans  public retirement plans  endowments and foundations  a family of mutual funds  which we call the whg funds  other mutual funds and clients of westwood trust 
westwood trust provides trust and custodial services and participation in common trust funds that it sponsors to institutions and high net worth individuals 
our revenues are generally derived from fees based on a percentage of assets under management  and at december   westwood management and westwood trust collectively managed assets valued at approximately billion 
we have been providing investment advisory services since and  according to recognized industry sources  including morningstar  inc  when measured over multi year periods of ten years and longer  our principal asset classes rank above the median in performance within their peer groups 
the core of our business is dependent on our client relationships 
we believe that  in addition to investment performance  client service is paramount in the asset management business 
as such  a major focus of our business strategy is to continue building strong relationships with clients to better enable us to anticipate their needs and to satisfy their investment objectives 
our team approach is designed to result in efficient  responsive service for our clients 
our future success is dependent to a significant degree on both investment performance and our ability to provide attentive client service 
we were incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on december  we are an independent public company  and our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol whg 
we are a holding company  and our principal assets consist of the capital stock of westwood management and westwood trust 
one of the priorities on which we have focused since is building a foundation in terms of personnel and infrastructure to support a potentially much larger business 
we have also developed products that we believe will be desirable within our target institutional and private client markets 
the cost of developing new products and the organization as a whole can result in our incurring expenses before material offsetting revenue is realized 
we believe that the foundation and products are now in place and have been taking these products to the institutional marketplace in recent years 
we have seen a high level of interest from institutional investors in these products  which we hope will generate new revenue streams

index to financial statements westwood management general westwood management provides investment advisory services to large institutions  including corporate retirement plans  public retirement plans  endowments and foundations  having at least million in investable assets  depending on the asset class 
westwood management also provides advisory services to the whg funds and subadvisory services to other mutual funds 
our overall investment philosophy is determined by our chief investment officer  susan m 
byrne  and  with respect to the bulk of assets under management  consists of a value oriented approach focused on achieving a superior  risk adjusted return by investing in companies positioned for growth but not fully recognized as such in the marketplace 
this investment approach is designed to preserve capital during unfavorable periods and provide superior real returns over the long term 
ms 
byrne has years of investment experience 
westwood management s investment advisory team consists of a number of investment management  research and trading professionals with substantial investment management experience 
the continuity of the team and its years of experience are critical elements in successfully managing investments 
managed asset classes asset management 
we offer a broad range of investment asset classes allowing us to serve various types of clients and varying investment objectives 
more than half of our assets under management are invested in our largecap value asset class 
the following sets forth the principal asset classes currently managed by westwood management largecap value investments in equity securities of approximately well seasoned companies with market capitalizations generally over billion 
this portfolio is invested in companies where we expect that future profitability  driven by operational improvements  will be higher than expectations reflected in current share prices 
smidcap value investments in equity securities of approximately companies with market capitalizations between million and billion 
similar to the largecap value asset class  we seek to discover operational improvements that are driving earnings growth within small to mid size companies that can be purchased inexpensively 
smallcap value investments in equity securities of approximately companies with market capitalizations between million and billion 
similar to the largecap value and smidcap value classes  we seek to invest in high quality companies whose earnings growth is driven by operational improvements not yet fully recognized by the market 
allcap value investments in equity securities of approximately well seasoned companies 
the portfolio is generally comprised of the best ideas within all market capitalizations above million 
similar to the largecap value asset class  we seek to invest in companies across a broad range of market capitalizations where we expect that future profitability  driven by operational improvements  will be higher than expectations currently reflected in share prices 
balanced investments in a combination of equity and fixed income securities  designed to provide both growth opportunities and income  while also emphasizing asset preservation in down markets 
westwood management applies its expertise in dynamic asset allocation and security selection decisions in carrying out this balanced strategy approach 
income opportunity investments in dividend paying common stocks  straight and convertible preferred stock  master limited partnerships  reits and selected debt instruments 
this portfolio s strategy focuses on companies with strong and improving cash flow sufficient to support a sustainable or rising income stream for investors 
this asset class is targeted towards investors seeking high current income through dividend paying and or interest bearing securities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements master limited partnerships mlps investments include mlps including limited partnerships  lps  and general partnerships  gps  securities of tanker and other marine shipping companies and other securities whose characteristics are consistent with those listed above 
the portfolio focuses on companies that  over time  exhibit higher dividend yields  stable and predictable cash flows  low correlations to other asset classes  and growth opportunities 
core intermediate fixed income investments in high grade  intermediate term corporate and government bonds 
we seek to add value to client portfolios through yield curve positioning and investing in debt instruments with improving credit quality potential 
each asset class consists of a portfolio of equity and or fixed income securities selected by westwood management s portfolio teams and chosen to best provide the long term returns consistent with westwood management s investment philosophy 
our portfolio teams make decisions for all of westwood management s asset classes in accordance with the investment objectives and policies of such asset classes  including determining when and which securities to purchase and sell 
we employ a value oriented approach in managing the bulk of our equity asset classes 
the common thread that permeates our investment strategies is our focus on a disciplined approach to controlling risk and  whenever possible  preserving the core value of the assets under management 
our value oriented asset classes place a greater emphasis on identifying companies where earnings result from actual operational improvements rather than from manufactured improvements derived from financial statement adjustments 
our desire to prevent the loss of the core value of the assets under management is the overriding objective of this strategy  even at the cost of potentially higher returns 
through investments in companies that exhibit these characteristics  westwood management seeks to demonstrate consistently superior performance relative to our industry peers and the broad market 
more than half of our assets under management are invested in equity securities of companies with large market capitalizations 
when measured over multi year periods  ten years and longer  westwood management s principal asset classes rank above the median within peer group performance rankings according to recognized industry sources  including morningstar  inc for the ten year period ended on december   our largecap value  smidcap value  balanced and core fixed income asset classes ranked in the top quartile in their peer groups 
our ability to grow assets under management is primarily dependent on our competitive long term performance record  building strong relationships with investment consulting firms nationwide as well as our ability to develop new client relationships 
we continually look for opportunities to expand our assets under management by growing our existing asset classes and developing new portfolios focusing on investment areas not part of our current asset classes under management 
we primarily intend to grow our asset classes internally but may consider acquiring new asset classes from third parties  as discussed under growth strategy below 
our growth strategy provides our clients with more investment opportunities and diversifies our assets under management  thereby reducing our risk in any one area of investment and increasing our competitive ability to attract new clients 
advisory and subadvisory service agreements westwood management manages client accounts under investment advisory and subadvisory agreements 
typical within the asset management industry  such agreements are usually terminable upon short notice and provide for compensation based on the market value of the client s assets under management 
westwood management s advisory fees are paid quarterly in advance based on assets under management on the last day of the preceding quarter  quarterly in arrears based on assets under management on the last day of the previous quarter  or are based on a daily or monthly analysis of assets under management for the stated period 
a limited number of our clients have a performance based fee component in their contract  which generates additional revenues if we outperform a specified index over a specific period of time 
we record revenue for performance based fees at the end of the measurement period 
revenue from advance payments is deferred and recognized over the period that services are performed 
pursuant to these agreements  westwood management provides overall investment management services  including directing investments in conformity with the investment objectives and restrictions established by clients 
unless otherwise directed in writing by our client  westwood management has the authority to vote all proxies with respect to client assets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements westwood management is also a party to subadvisory agreements with other investment advisors under which it performs substantially the same services as it does under its advisory agreements 
however  the investment strategy adopted for a particular client is subject to supervision and review by the client 
our subadvisory fees are computed based upon the daily net assets of the client and are payable on a monthly basis 
as with our advisory agreements  these agreements are terminable upon short notice 
under our subadvisory agreement with teton advisors  inc formerly gabelli advisers  inc  westwood management provides investment advisory services to the gamco westwood funds family of mutual funds 
westwood management owns shares of class a common stock representing a economic interest in teton advisors  inc  a subsidiary of gamco investors  inc based on sec filings  we believe that gamco investors  inc owned of our common stock as of december  westwood management received subadvisory payments from teton advisors  inc of   and  for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
while westwood management provides subadvisory services with respect to the westwood funds family of funds  westwood management provides investment advisory services directly to the whg funds family of mutual funds  which includes the whg smidcap fund  the whg income opportunity fund  the whg largecap value fund  the whg balanced fund and the whg smallcap value fund 
whg funds represent the family of institutional mutual funds for which westwood management serves as advisor 
westwood funds represent the family of mutual funds for which westwood management serves as subadvisor 
our largest client in terms of fee revenue paid us both asset based and performance based advisory fees during the last two years 
due to a significant performance fee earned in  this client accounted for of our fee revenues and our four largest clients accounted for approximately of fee revenues for the twelve months ended december  the loss of some or all of these clients or the failure to achieve superior investment performance necessary to earn a performance fee could have a material adverse affect on our business and our results of operations 
westwood trust general westwood trust provides trust and custodial services and participation in common trust funds that it sponsors to institutions and high net worth individuals generally having at least million in assets under management 
westwood trust seeks to define and improve the risk return profile of the client s investment portfolio by complementing or enhancing existing investment strategies 
westwood trust also provides back office services to its clients  including tax reporting  distribution of income to beneficiaries  preparation of trust and account statements and attending to the special needs of particular trusts  as well as serves as trustee for tax and estate planning purposes and for special needs trusts 
westwood trust is chartered and regulated by the texas department of banking 
westwood trust primarily provides services for employee benefit trusts and personal trusts 
employee benefit trusts include retirement plans of businesses to benefit their employees  such as defined contribution plans  pensions and profit sharing plans 
westwood trust may also be appointed as a trustee and may provide administrative support for these plans  as well as investment advisory and custodial services 
personal trusts are developed to achieve a number of different objectives  and westwood trust acts as trustee to these trusts and assists them in developing tax efficient trust portfolios 
the fees charged by westwood trust are separately negotiated with each client and are based on the complexity of the operations of the trust and the amount of assets under management 
services westwood trust undertakes a fiduciary responsibility toward the management of each client s assets and utilizes a consultative asset allocation approach 
this approach involves westwood trust examining the client s financial situation  including the client s current portfolio of investments  and advising the client on ways in which it can enhance its investment returns and financial position 
westwood trust also provides custodial services  safekeeping and accounting services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements common trust funds westwood trust sponsors a number of common trust funds in which our clients assets are commingled to achieve economies of scale 
westwood trust s common trust funds fall within two basic categories personal trusts and employee benefit trusts 
westwood trust sponsors common trust funds for most of the asset classes managed by westwood management 
westwood trust also engages third party subadvisors for some common trust funds  such as our growth equity  international equity and high yield bond common trust funds 
enhanced balanced portfolios westwood trust is a strong proponent of asset class diversification  and offers its clients the ability to diversify among multiple different asset classes 
westwood trust enhanced balanced portfolios seek to combine these asset classes into a customizable portfolio for clients seeking to maximize return for a given level of risk 
periodic adjustments are made to asset class weightings in enhanced balanced portfolios based on historical returns  risk and correlation data  as well as an analysis of our capital markets outlook 
distribution channels we market our services through several distribution channels that allow us to expand the reach of our investment advisory services 
these channels enable us to leverage existing distribution infrastructure and capabilities of other financial services firms and intermediaries while focusing on our core competency of developing outstanding investment asset classes 
institutional investment consultants investment management consulting firms serve as gatekeepers to many corporate retirement plans  public retirement plans  endowments and foundations  which represent westwood s primary client target markets 
consultants provide guidance in setting client asset allocation strategy  as well as creating investment policies 
consultants also make recommendations for investment firms they believe can best meet their client s investment objectives 
we have established strong relationships with many national and regional investment consulting firms  which has resulted in our being considered and hired by many of their clients 
continuing to enhance our existing consulting firm relationships  as well as forging new relationships  serves to increase the awareness of our services in both the consultant community and their underlying institutional client base 
subadvisory relationships our subadvisory relationships allow us to extend the reach of our investment management services to clients of other investment companies with broad  established distribution capabilities 
in subadvisory arrangements  our client is typically the investment company through which our services are offered to investors 
in these subadvisory arrangements  our investment advisory services are typically made available through retail based mutual fund offerings 
the investment company that sponsors the mutual fund is responsible for marketing  distribution  operations and accounting related to these funds 
managed accounts managed accounts are similar in some respects to subadvisory relationships in that a third party financial institution  such as a brokerage firm or turnkey asset management program provider  handles distribution to the end client 
the end client in a managed account is typically a high net worth individual or small institution 
in these arrangements  the third party financial institution is responsible to the end client for client service  operations and accounting 
growth strategy we believe that we have established a strong platform to support future growth  deriving our strength in large part from the experience and capabilities displayed by our management team and skilled investment professionals 
we believe that this focused  stable team has contributed in large part to our solid investment performance  superior client service and a growing array of asset classes 
we believe that opportunities for future growth may come from our ability to generate growth from new and existing clients and consultant relationships 
table of contents 
index to financial statements attract and retain key employees grow assets in our additional asset classes foster continued growth of the westwood trust platform foster expanded distribution via mutual funds pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances continue to strengthen our brand name 
generate growth from new and existing clients and consultant relationships 
as our primary business objective  we intend to maintain and enhance existing relationships with clients and investment consultants by continuing to provide solid investment performance and high quality customer service to existing relationships 
additionally  we intend to pursue growth through targeted sales and marketing efforts that emphasize our investment performance and superior client service 
new institutional client accounts are generally derived through investment consultants  and we have been successful in developing solid long term relationships with many national and regional investment consultants 
we believe that the familiarity with our firm  our people and our processes that we have built in consultant and client relationships is one of the key factors in being considered for new client investment mandates 
attract and retain key employees 
in order to achieve our performance and client relationship objectives  we must be able to retain and attract talented investment professionals 
we believe that we have created a workplace environment in which motivated  performance driven  and client oriented individuals thrive 
as a public company  we are able to offer to our employees a compensation program that includes strong equity incentives such that the success of our employees will be closely tied to the success of our clients 
we believe that these factors are critical ingredients in maintaining a stable  client focused environment  and accordingly we have built a firm that we believe can support significant future growth 
grow assets in our additional asset classes 
largecap value is our flagship product and we believe it has significant capacity for additional assets  however  we continue to develop additional asset classes in response to client needs and the opportunities we see in the marketplace 
we believe these additional asset classes provide opportunities for us to grow our assets under management 
for instance  we have achieved meaningful growth in assets in our smidcap value product since we began marketing this asset class to institutions in we have also developed new asset classes in recent years that we intend to introduce to the institutional marketplace in the future 
smallcap value has a five year track record  income opportunity has compiled a six year track record and allcap value will soon complete a seven year track record 
we began marketing smallcap value to institutions in and it has already completed the approval process at many investment consulting firms  earning several institutional mandates during in  we launched an mlp portfolio in response to the needs of an existing client 
we believe that we have the team in place to support these products in the institutional marketplace 
if we continue to deliver strong performance  we believe that demand for these asset classes can provide meaningful growth in our assets under management 
foster continued growth of the westwood trust platform 
westwood trust has experienced solid growth in serving small to medium sized institutions and high net worth individuals 
we are seeing continued interest from clients and prospects in the diversified  highly attentive service model that we have developed 
a significant percentage of new asset growth at westwood trust stems from referrals and additional assets from existing clients 
we believe the continued acceptance of our enhanced balanced product  which offers diversified exposure to multiple asset classes in a tax efficient  comprehensive solution for clients  provides us with opportunities for future growth 
foster expanded distribution via mutual funds 
the whg funds consist of the whg smidcap fund  the whg income opportunity fund  the whg largecap value fund  the whg balanced fund and the whg smallcap value fund  which were launched in through the whg funds  which mirror our institutional strategies  offer capped expense ratios and are available in an institutional share class for all funds 
in december we launched an a share in the whg largecap value fund and the whg income opportunity fund in order to target no transaction fee ntf mutual fund supermarket platforms and the broker dealer marketplace 
the whg smidcap and whg income opportunity funds were both recently awarded star ratings by morningstar 
we expect the whg largecap value and whg balanced funds to be rated by morningstar in after 
table of contents 
index to financial statements they complete year track records later this year 
we believe that access to our smidcap value  income opportunity  largecap value  balanced and smallcap value asset classes via an institutional mutual fund vehicle will present an attractive offering for certain segments of institutional investors  including k plans 
pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances 
we will carefully evaluate strategic acquisition  joint venture and alliance opportunities 
we may express an interest in pursuing acquisitions of asset management firms  mutual funds  or trust companies having assets where we have expertise or that appear appropriate as a means of expanding the range of asset classes or services we offer or expanding our distribution capabilities 
by acquiring investment firms that successfully manage asset classes beyond our current expertise we could increase opportunities to attract new clients and provide existing clients with an even more diversified range of asset classes 
we may also consider entering into alliances with other financial services firms to allow us to leverage our core competency of developing superior investment products in combination with alliance partners that could provide us with enhanced distribution capabilities or provide our clients with access to additional service offerings 
continue strengthening our brand name 
we believe that the strength of our brand name has been a key component to our successful long term tenure in the investment industry and will continue to be instrumental to our future success 
we have developed our strong brand name largely through high profile coverage in various investment publications and electronic media 
a number of our investment professionals  including ms 
byrne  david s 
spika  investment strategist  and mark freeman  senior vice president  enjoy a visible presence in print and electronic media  which we believe enhances our brand name 
we will continue to look for creative ways to strengthen our brand name and reputation in our target client markets 
competition we are subject to substantial and growing competition in all aspects of our business 
barriers to entry to the asset management business are relatively low  and we believe that we will face a growing number of competitors 
although no one company dominates the asset management industry  many companies are larger  better known and have greater resources than us 
further  we compete with other asset management firms on the basis of asset classes offered  the investment performance of those asset classes in absolute terms and relative to peer group performance  quality of service  fees charged  the level and type of compensation offered to key employees  and the manner in which asset classes are marketed 
many of our competitors offer more asset classes and services and may also have substantially greater assets under management 
we compete against numerous investment dealers  banks  insurance companies and others that sell equity funds  taxable income funds  tax free investments and other investment products 
in addition  the allocation by many investors of assets from active equity investment to index funds  fixed income or similar asset classes has enhanced the ability of firms offering non equity asset classes and passive equity management to compete with us effectively 
in short  the competitive landscape in which we operate is both intense and dynamic  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in the future as an independent company 
additionally  most prospective clients perform a thorough review of an investment manager s background  investment policies and performance before committing assets to that manager 
in many cases  prospective clients invite a number of competing firms to make presentations 
the process of obtaining a new client typically takes twelve to eighteen months from the time of the initial contact 
while we have achieved a high degree of success in competing successfully for new clients  it is a process to which we must continue to dedicate significant resources over an extended period  with no certainty of success

risk factors we believe these represent the material risks currently facing our business 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
you should also refer to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report  including our financial statements and related notes 
poor investment performance of assets managed by us could adversely affect our results of operations 
because we compete with many asset management firms on the basis of asset classes offered and the investment performance of those asset classes  our success is dependent to a significant extent on the investment performance of the assets that we manage 
because our revenue is primarily generated from fees derived as a percentage of assets under management  poor performance tends to result in the loss or reduction of client accounts  which correspondingly decreases revenues 
underperformance relative to peer groups for our various asset classes could adversely affect our results of operations  especially if such underperformance continues for a lengthy period of time 
some management employees are considered critical to our success  and our inability to attract and retain key employees could compromise our future success 
we believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the services of our executive officers  particularly susan m 
byrne  our chairman of the board and chief investment officer  and brian o 
casey  our president and chief executive officer 
as with other asset management businesses  our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of these and other key officers  investment professionals  marketing  client service and management personnel 
there is substantial competition for skilled personnel and the loss of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
our revenues are dependent upon the performance of the securities markets and negative performance of the securities markets could reduce our revenues 
our results of operations are affected by many economic factors  including the performance of the securities markets 
negative performance within the securities markets or short term volatility within the securities markets could result in investors withdrawing assets  decreasing their rates of investment or shifting assets to cash or other asset classes that we do not manage  all of which could reduce our revenues 
because most of our revenues are based on the value of assets under management  a decline in the value of those assets would also adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  in periods of slowing growth or declining revenues  profits and profit margins are adversely affected because certain expenses remain relatively fixed 
in particular  more than half of our assets under management are invested in equity securities of companies with a large market capitalization 
as a consequence  we are particularly susceptible to the volatility associated with changes in the market for large capitalization stocks 
due to this concentration  any change or reduction in such markets  including a shift of our clients and potential clients preference from investments in equity securities of large capitalization stocks to other equity or fixed income securities could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and results of operations 
this negative impact could occur due to the depreciation in value of our assets under management  the election by clients to select other firms to manage their assets or the election by clients to allocate assets away from asset classes that we manage 
any of these events would result in decreased assets under management and therefore reduced revenues and a decline in results of operations 
if we are unable to realize benefits from the costs we have incurred and are continuing to incur to develop new asset classes and otherwise broaden our capabilities  our growth opportunities may be adversely affected 
we have incurred significant costs during the last several years to develop new asset classes  including smidcap value  smallcap value  allcap value  income opportunity and an mlp portfolio  to launch five new mutual funds  the whg smidcap fund  the whg income opportunity fund  the whg largecap value fund  the whg balanced fund and the whg 
table of contents 
index to financial statements smallcap value fund and also to upgrade our business infrastructure 
some of the costs associated with these improvements will continue to be incurred in future periods and are relatively fixed 
we may not realize the benefits of these investments and  in the event we are not able to do so  our growth opportunities may be adversely affected 
due to the substantial cost and time required to introduce new asset classes in our industry  we may not be able to successfully introduce new asset classes in a timely manner  or at all 
the development and marketing of new asset classes in our industry requires a substantial amount of time and financial resources 
our ability to market and sell a new asset class successfully depends on our financial resources  the performance results of the specific asset class  the timing of the offering and our marketing strategies 
once an asset class is developed  whether through acquisition or internal development  we must still effectively market the asset class to our existing and prospective clients 
this entails incurring substantial financial costs related to research on the target assets and the demand for such asset class in the market  as well as sales and marketing costs associated with attracting assets to the new asset class 
in addition  our ability to sell new asset classes to our existing and prospective clients depends on our ability to meet or exceed the performance of our competitors who offer the same or similar asset classes 
we may not be able to manage the assets within a given asset class profitably 
moreover  it may take years before we are able to produce the level of results that will enable us to attract clients 
if we are unable to realize the benefits of the costs and expenses incurred in developing new asset classes  we may experience losses as a result of our management of these asset classes  and our ability to introduce further new asset classes and compete in our industry may be hampered 
our business is dependent on investment advisory  subadvisory and trust agreements that are subject to termination or non renewal 
as a result  we could lose any of our clients on very short notice 
substantially all of our revenues are derived pursuant to investment advisory  subadvisory and trust agreements with our clients 
in general  either party may terminate these agreements upon days notice 
any termination of  or failure to renew  a material number of these agreements could have a material adverse impact on us  particularly because many of our costs are relatively fixed 
a small number of clients account for a substantial portion of our business 
as such  the reduction or loss of business with any of these clients could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our largest client in terms of revenue paid us both asset based and performance based advisory fees during the last two years 
due to a significant performance fee earned in  this client accounted for of our fee revenues and our largest four clients accounted for of fee revenues for the twelve months ended december   and we are therefore dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with these clients 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining these existing client relationships  securing additional clients or achieving the superior investment performance necessary to earn a performance based advisory fee 
any failure by us to retain one or more of these large clients or establish profitable relationships with additional clients could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins 
the investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry 
to the extent we have to compete on the basis of price  we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure 
although our investment management fees vary from product to product  we have competed primarily on the performance of our products and client service rather than on the level of our investment management fees relative to our competitors 
in recent years there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry 
in order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment  we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that make investors willing to pay our fees 
we cannot be assured that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure 
fee reductions on existing or future new business could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements performance fees could have a significant effect on our revenues and results of operations 
we have performance fee agreements with a small number of our clients  which would pay us a fee if we outperform a specified index over predetermined periods of time 
there can be no assurance that we will perform well relative to such indexes and the failure to do so would cause us to earn none or only part of those potential revenues  which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
our revenues from performance based fees could fluctuate significantly from one measurement period to the next  depending on how we perform relative to the indexes specified in these agreements 
any event that negatively affects the asset management industry in general could have a material adverse effect on us 
any event affecting the asset management industry that results in a general decrease in assets under management or a significant general decline in the number of advisory clients or accounts could negatively impact our revenues 
our future growth and success depends in part upon the growth of the asset management industry 
our business is subject to extensive regulation with attendant costs of compliance and serious consequences for violations 
virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various laws and regulations including the investment advisers act  the investment company act  and anti money laundering laws 
these laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad administrative powers  including the power to limit or restrict us from operating our business as well as the powers to place us under conservatorship or closure in the event we fail to comply with such laws and regulations 
violations of such laws or regulations could subject us and or our employees to disciplinary proceedings and civil or criminal liability  including revocation of licenses  censures  fines or temporary suspension  permanent bar from the conduct of business  conservatorship  or closure 
any such proceeding or liability could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
due to the extensive regulations and laws to which we are subject  our management is required to devote substantial time and effort to legal and regulatory compliance issues 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change 
we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations 
see regulation 
misuse of assets and information in the possession of our investment professionals and employees could result in costly litigation and liability for us and our clients 
our investment professionals handle a significant amount of assets along with financial and personal information for our clients 
although we have implemented a system of controls to minimize the risk of a fraudulent taking or misuse of assets and information  there can be no assurance that our controls will be adequate to prevent such fraudulent actions by our portfolio managers or employees 
if our controls are ineffective in preventing the fraudulent taking or misuse of assets and information  we could be subject to costly litigation  which could consume a substantial amount of our resources  distract our management from our operations  and could also result in regulatory sanctions 
additionally  any such fraudulent actions could adversely affect some of our clients in other ways  and these clients could seek redress against us 
acquisitions involve inherent risks that could compromise the success of the combined business and dilute the holdings of current stockholders 
as part of our long term business strategy  we may consider acquisitions of similar or complementary businesses 
see growth strategy 
if we are not correct when we assess the value  strengths  weaknesses  liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates or if we are not successful in integrating the operations of the acquired businesses  the success of the combined business could be compromised 
any future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly associated with acquisitions 
these risks include  among others  potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and to acquisition costs and expenses  the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential

index to financial statements disruption to the business of the combined company and potential diversion of management s time and attention  the impairment of relationships with and the possible loss of key employees and clients as a result of the changes in management  potential future write downs related to goodwill impairment in connection with acquisitions  and dilution to the stockholders of the combined company if the acquisition is made for stock of the combined company 
in addition  asset classes  technologies or businesses of acquired companies may not be effectively assimilated into our business or have a positive effect on the combined company s revenues or earnings 
the combined company may also incur significant expense to complete acquisitions and to support the acquired asset classes and businesses 
further  any such acquisitions may be funded with cash  debt or equity  which could have the effect of diluting the holdings or limiting the rights of stockholders 
finally  we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms 
various factors may hinder the declaration and payment of dividends 
we have historically paid a quarterly dividend 
however  the payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and various factors may prevent us from paying dividends 
such factors include our financial position  capital requirements and liquidity  the existence of a stock repurchase program  state corporate and banking law restrictions  results of operations and such other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant 
in addition  as a holding company  our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the dividends and income we receive from our subsidiaries 
at the present time our primary source of cash is dividends that may be received from westwood management or westwood trust 
the payment of dividends by westwood management or westwood trust is subject to the discretion of their boards of directors and compliance with applicable laws  including  in particular  the provisions of the texas finance code applicable to westwood trust 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business is vulnerable to systems failures that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any delays or inaccuracies in securities pricing information or information processing could give rise to claims against us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are highly dependent on communications and information systems and on third party vendors for securities pricing information and updates from certain software 
we may suffer a systems failure or interruption  whether caused by an earthquake  fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  unauthorized access  act of god  act of war or otherwise  and our back up procedures and capabilities may not be adequate or sufficient to eliminate the risk of extended interruptions in operations 
we may not be able to fund future capital requirements on favorable terms  if at all 
we cannot be certain that financing to fund our working capital or other cash requirements  if needed  will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
our capital requirements will vary greatly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other things  capital expenditures  fluctuations in our operating results and financing activities 
if future financing is necessary  we may or may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all 
further  any future equity financings could dilute the relative percentage ownership of the then existing holders of our common stock  and any future debt financings could involve restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports  our brand and operating results could be harmed 
all internal control systems  no matter how well designed  have inherent limitations 
therefore  even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 
we cannot be certain that the measures we take to evaluate and improve our internal controls will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to

if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
our organizational documents contain provisions that may prevent or deter another group from paying a premium over the market price to our stockholders to acquire our stock

in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law relating to business combinations 
these provisions could delay  deter or prevent a merger  consolidation  tender offer or other business combination or change of control involving us that could include a premium over the market price of our common stock that some or a majority of our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 
we are a holding company and are dependent on the operations and funds of our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company  with no revenue generating operations and no assets other than our ownership interests in westwood management and westwood trust 
accordingly  we are dependent on the cash flow generated by these operating subsidiaries and must rely on dividends or other intercompany transfers from these operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations

overview we manage investment assets and provide services for our clients through our two subsidiaries  westwood management and westwood trust 
westwood management provides investment advisory services to corporate retirement plans  public retirement plans  endowments and foundations  the whg funds  other mutual funds and clients of westwood trust 
westwood trust provides institutions and high net worth individuals trust and custodial services and participation in common trust funds that it sponsors 
our revenues are generally derived from fees based on a percentage of assets under management and at december  westwood management and westwood trust collectively managed assets valued at approximately billion 
we have been providing investment advisory services since and  according to recognized industry sources  including morningstar  inc  when measured over multi year periods  our principal asset classes have consistently ranked above the median in performance within their peer groups 
one of the priorities on which we have focused since our spin off in is building a foundation in terms of personnel and infrastructure to support a potentially much larger business 
we have also developed products that we believe will be desirable within our target institutional and private client markets 
the cost of developing new products and the organization as a whole has resulted in us incurring expenses that  in some cases  do not currently have material offsetting revenue 
now that we believe the foundation and the products are in place  we are taking these new products to the institutional marketplace and believe that institutional investors will recognize the value in these products and generate new revenue streams for us 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we began marketing our smidcap value product to institutional investment consultants in late as a result of this targeted marketing effort  we gained a number of meaningful smidcap value clients in through with assets increasing from million at december  to billion at december  we continue to devote significant marketing efforts to the institutional market for our smidcap value product as well as for our smallcap value product  which now has a five year track record 
our smallcap value product is progressing through the approval process at many investment consulting firms and we are beginning to see search activity in this capacity constrained product 
we won our first institutional separate account mandates in smallcap value in between december and april we also launched five mutual funds under the whg funds name 
as of december   assets in these five funds were approximately million 
in addition to the funds existing institutional share class  in december we launched an a share in the whg largecap value fund and in the whg income opportunity fund in order to target no transaction fee ntf mutual fund supermarket platforms and the broker dealer marketplace 
we have an additional whg fund registered with the sec  the whg allcap value fund  and are evaluating opportunities to launch this fund in the future 
revenues we derive our revenues from investment advisory fees  trust fees  and other revenues 
our advisory fees are generated by westwood management  which manages client accounts under investment advisory and subadvisory agreements 
advisory fees are calculated based on a percentage of assets under management  and are paid in accordance with the terms of the agreements 
westwood management s advisory fees are paid quarterly in advance based on assets under management on the last day of the preceding quarter  quarterly in arrears based on assets under management on the last day of the previous quarter  or are based on a daily or monthly analysis of assets under management for the stated period 
westwood management recognizes revenues as services are rendered 
a limited number of our clients have a performance based fee component in their contract  which generates additional revenues if we outperform a specified index over a specific period of time 
we record revenue for performance based fees at the end of the measurement periods 
in  we recognized a performance based fee for a client in the second quarter and a separate performance based fee for another client in the fourth quarter 
since most of our advance paying clients billing periods coincide with the calendar quarter to which payment relates  the revenue related to those clients is fully recognized within the quarter 
consequently  there is not a significant amount of deferred revenue contained in our financial statements 
our trust fees are generated by westwood trust pursuant to trust or custodial agreements 
trust fees are separately negotiated with each client and are generally based on a percentage of assets under management  which in turn is influenced by the complexity of the operations of the trust and the services provided 
westwood trust also provides trust services to a small number of clients on a fixed fee basis 
most trust fees are paid quarterly in advance and are recognized as services are rendered 
since the majority of westwood trust s advance paying clients billing periods coincide with the calendar quarter to which payment relates  the revenue related to those clients is fully recognized within the quarter  consequently  there is not a significant amount of deferred revenue contained in our financial statements 
our other revenues generally consist of interest and investment income 
although we invest most of our cash in bonds  we also invest in equity instruments and money market funds 
assets under management assets under management decreased million  or  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the decrease in assets under management was primarily due to market depreciation of assets under management  partially offset by net inflows of assets from new and existing clients

agency custody accounts represent non discretionary accounts in which westwood trust provides agent or custodial services  but does not act in an advisory capacity 
for certain assets in this category  westwood trust currently provides limited custody services for a minimal or zero fee  but views these assets as potentially converting to fee generating managed assets in the future 
as an example  some assets in this category consist of low basis stock currently being held in custody for clients  but will likely transfer to fee generating managed assets during an inter generational transfer of wealth at some future date

we define cash expenses as total expenses less non cash equity based compensation expense 
although depreciation on fixed assets is a non cash expense  we do not add it back when calculating cash earnings or deduct it when calculating cash expenses because depreciation charges represent a decline in the value of the related assets that will ultimately require replacement

the changes in net cash provided by operating activities generally reflect the changes in earnings plus the effect of non cash items and changes in working capital

we had no liabilities for borrowed money at december  or december   and our accounts payable were paid in the ordinary course of business for each of the periods then ended 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including our results of operations  the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures or strategic initiatives and our dividend policy 
we believe that current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the operating and capital requirements of our ordinary business operations through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing within this time frame

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective of the statement is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in applying accounting principles  we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are areas where the degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
goodwill during the third quarters of  and  we completed our annual impairment assessment as required by sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment losses were required 
we perform our annual impairment assessment as of july and would reassess if circumstances indicated a potential impairment between our annual assessment dates 
we assess the fair value of our business units with goodwill using a market multiple approach 
no events occurred in the last half of that indicated that these assets should be retested for impairment 
stock options for all options granted after january   we have been expensing the cost associated with employees as well as non employee directors 
we value stock options issued based upon the black scholes option pricing model and recognize this value as an expense over the periods in which the options vest 
implementation of the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make certain assumptions  including expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield and expected life of the options 
we utilized assumptions that we believed to be most appropriate at the time of the valuation 
had we used different assumptions in the pricing model the expense recognized for stock options may have been different than the expense recognized in our financial statements 
as of december   all outstanding options were vested and all related compensation had been expensed 
restricted stock we have granted restricted stock to employees  non employee directors and a non employee consultant 
we calculate compensation cost for restricted stock grants by using the fair market value of its common stock at the date of grant  the number of shares issued and an estimate of shares that will not vest due to forfeitures 
this compensation cost is amortized on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period 
the estimate of shares that will not vest due to forfeitures is based on our historical forfeiture rate and our expectation of potential forfeitures  which is dependent upon our judgment 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
if forfeitures of restricted stock do not occur or are significantly less than our estimation  we would record as much as  of compensation cost in addition to what we currently expect to expense over the next years 
accounting for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects the statutory tax obligations of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment and complex calculations are used in determining our tax liability and in evaluating our tax positions 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that actual outcomes will likely be different from our estimates 
changes in tax laws may result in a change to our tax position and effective tax rate 
we classify any interest or penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense 
deferred income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities as measured at enacted income tax rates 
our deferred taxes relate principally to stock based compensation expense  which is deductible for tax purposes at the time restricted stock vests and stock options are exercised 

table of contents 
index to financial statements significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized below 
revenue recognition investment advisory and trust fees are recognized in the period the services are provided 
these fees are determined in accordance with contracts between our subsidiaries and their clients and are generally based on a percentage of assets under management 
performance based fees may pay us an additional fee if we outperform a specified index over a specific period of time 
we record revenue for performance based fees at the end of the measurement period when the fees have been fully earned 
accounting for investments we have designated our investments  other than money market holdings  as trading securities  which are recorded at market value with the related unrealized gains and losses reflected in other revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
our trading securities  primarily us government and government agency obligations as well as mutual fund and common trust fund shares  are valued based upon quoted market prices and  with respect to funds  the net asset value of the shares held as reported by the fund 
we have generally designated our investments in money market accounts as available for sale 
the market values of our money market holdings generally do not fluctuate 
dividends and interest on all of our investments are accrued as earned 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our corporate capital in various financial instruments such as united states treasury bills  equity mutual funds and united states government agency obligations  which entail certain inherent market risks 
we do not currently participate in any hedging activities  nor do we currently utilize any derivative financial instruments 
the following information describes the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risks 
interest rates and securities markets our cash equivalents and other investment instruments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates  which may affect our interest income 
these instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
we do not expect our interest income to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates 
the value of our assets under management is affected by changes in interest rates and fluctuations in securities markets 
since we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from investment advisory and trust fees based on the value of assets under management  our revenues may be adversely affected by changing interest rates or a decline in the prices of securities generally
