item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of national coal corp 
and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows of national coal corp 
for the fiscal years ended december   and except for historical information  the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond our control 
we mine  process and sell high quality bituminous steam coal from mines located in east tennessee  north alabama and  until march   in southeastern kentucky 
we own the coal mineral rights to approximately  acres of land and lease the rights to approximately  additional acres excluding the southeast kentucky properties  known as straight creek 
we have expanded our operations considerably since commencing operations at a single surface mine in tennessee in july as of december   our active mining complexes included three underground mines  one underground mine in the development stage  six surface mines  and one highwall mine 
in addition  we have two preparation plants and two unit train loading facilities served by the norfolk southern ns railroad in tennessee and are a minority partner in the owner of a barge loading facility on the warrior river in alabama 
we hold permits that allow us to open or re open seven mines close to our current operations 

table of contents as of december   we controlled approximately million estimated recoverable tons of coal reserves as defined by sec industry guide we generated total revenues of million  had a net loss of million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to total revenues of million  a net loss of million or per diluted share for the year ended december  we produced million tons of coal and sold million tons of coal in  compared to million tons and million tons in  respectively 
also for the year ended december  we had an adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda loss of million  compared to adjusted ebitda of million for the year ended december  see page for a description of adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation to net loss 
our revenue per ton of coal sold has increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   a increase 
approximately of our production for was produced at underground mines and was produced at our surface and highwall mining operations 
in october  we acquired mann steel products  inc  now national coal of alabama  with mines located in north alabama for approximately million 
national coal of alabama operates four surface mines  extracting high quality coal on leases encompassing million tons of reserves at december  and produced approximately million tons of coal during national coal of alabama controls approximately million tons of leased reserves at december  and we believe there are additional unproven reserves among the company s controlled or permitted properties 
our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of coal to electric utility companies and industrial customers in the southeastern united states 
during the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was generated from coal sales to electric utility companies under long term contracts or open purchase orders with long standing customers 
our largest customers were georgia power  alabama power  and solutia  inc  representing approximately  and of our revenues  respectively 
since inception  we have expanded our production capacity by actively pursuing the development and permitting of properties acquired through strategic acquisitions in tennessee and alabama 
we have been able to increase the of market for our coal to customers that may benefit from transportation costs advantages due to the location of our mines and loading facilities 
in february  we purchased a mile short line railroad from norfork southern for approximately million 
this short line railroad which connects our new river reserves and baldwin facilities to the norfolk southern main line rail facilities at oneida  tennessee became operational in the third quarter of we acquired the baldwin preparation plant and rail load out facility in in return for the assumption of certain reclamation liabilities and spent million during to refurbish and modernize the preparation plant and rail load out facility 
the expenditures made on our transportation and preparation plant infrastructure including the short line railroad and the baldwin facility reduce our transportation and coal preparation cost and provide us additional opportunities to market coal produced from our owned reserves on the new river tract 
when economically advantageous and market conditions are favorable  we also intend to take advantage of our increased production capabilities 
over the longer term  we plan to continue to permit and develop additional properties from our current reserve base while continuing to explore opportunities in nearby areas 
during we invested million in equipment and mine development including million purchased through equipment financing arrangements 
of this total  million was used to acquire a acre mineral lease in eastern tennessee that includes approximately million tons of recoverable high quality coal 
additionally  we acquired a  acre mineral and surface tract in eastern tennessee that includes approximately million tons of high quality coal 
the purchase price was million of which million was paid in cash and million in the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
we intend to invest approximately million in capital expenditures during to maintain planned production goals and approximately million to maintain existing assets 

table of contents we sell a majority of our coal pursuant to long term contracts or open purchase order arrangements with long time customers 
long term contracts as customary in the industry are defined as those with a duration of one year or more 
during  we successfully renegotiated several of our existing coal supply agreements resulting in an increased selling price per ton and additional revenues from those contracts 
the contracted weighted average selling price per ton is  and on million  million and million contracted tons for  and  respectively 
we plan to continue negotiations with existing and new customers to obtain additional sales for the high quality coals from our controlled and permitted properties in tennessee and alabama including recently acquired properties 
we have not yet priced a portion of the coal we have the capability of producing over the next several years in order to take advantage of possible future market demand or to realize possible long term opportunities with certain users of high quality reserves we control 
at december   our un priced and uncommitted future production was approximately million to million tons in  million to million tons in and million tons in during the first quarter of  our dragline equipment utilized on our l 
massey surface mine in alabama suffered a major mechanical failure 
the equipment was repaired  moved to the poplar springs mining complex and placed back in production in the third quarter this breakdown resulted in estimated lost production of  tons and lost revenues of million during the year ended december  our financial results from operations depend heavily upon our production costs 
our primary expenses related to production costs are wages and benefits  repairs and maintenance  diesel fuel and other petroleum products  blasting supplies  truck and rail transportation  cost of purchased coal  processing and loading costs  taxes and royalties incurred in selling coal 
during  we experienced severe increases in diesel fuel and costs associated with all petroleum related products and also encountered additional regulatory examination  as did most of our competitors  that weakened productivity 
our exploration costs of approximately million significantly increased as compared to million in reflecting a full year of national coal of alabama exploration costs included in as compared to only three months in and ongoing exploration efforts in tennessee in we have a full time staff in tennessee and alabama that operate drilling rigs in ongoing efforts to identify and prove up additional economically mineable and marketable reserves on our existing controlled properties and other properties we believe may have potential 
on march   our wholly owned subsidiary  national coal corporation  completed the sale of assets that comprise the straight creek mining operations in bell  leslie and harlan counties  kentucky to xinergy corp 
xinergy for million in cash in accordance with the terms and conditions of a purchase agreement entered into among the parties on february  as a result of the transaction  we were relieved of approximately million in reclamation liabilities  and million of equipment related debt which were assumed by xinergy in the transaction 
the sale included property  plant  equipment  and mine development with a net book value of approximately million 
after a negative working capital adjustment of approximately  the transaction resulted in a loss of approximately  which is reflected in other other income expense  net on our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  additionally  the transaction resulted in the subsequent release of approximately million in restricted cash that was previously pledged to secure reclamation bonds and other liabilities associated with the straight creek mining operations 
in conjunction with this transaction  we signed a contract mining and services agreement with xinergy dated april  to provide highwall mining services to xinergy at our former properties in southeast kentucky for a period of up to twenty four months 
as a result of this sale  in march and april we used the proceeds from the sale of the straight creek  kentucky properties to repay in its entirety the million term loan credit facility and accrued interest of approximately  that was entered into in october with guggenheim corporate funding  llc the repayment resulted in additional interest expense of  for the year ended december  from the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the term loan credit facility

critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to computing depreciation  depletion  amortization  accretion  the basis of reclamation and workers compensation liabilities  asset impairment  valuing non cash transactions  and recovery of receivables 
estimates are then based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  the corresponding accounts receivable and the methods of estimating depletion and reclamation expense of actual mining operations in relation to estimated total mineable tonnage on our properties 
revenue recognition 
under sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in the case of coal we mine and sell  we negotiate a specific sales contract with each customer  which includes a fixed price per ton  a delivery schedule  and terms for payment 
when applicable  freight costs billed to the customers as part of the contract price are included as coal sales with the offsetting expense included in cost of sales 
we recognize revenue from sales made pursuant to these contracts at the time the coal is loaded onto rail cars  barges and trucks at our load out  mine  and processing plant facilities 
property  plant  equipment and mine development 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that do not improve efficiency or extend economic life are expensed as incurred 
plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of assets which generally range from seven to thirty years for building and plant and one to seven years for equipment 
on sale or retirement  asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is reflected in income 
leasing is used for certain capital additions when considered cost effective relative to other capital sources 
all leases with an initial term greater than one year are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   accounting for leases 
these leases are classified as either capital or operating as appropriate 
leased equipment meeting the capital lease criteria of sfas is capitalized and the present value of the related minimum lease payments is recorded as a liability 
amortization of capitalized leased assets is computed on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the initial lease term 

table of contents reserves and mine development costs are recorded at cost or at fair value in the case of acquired businesses 
our coal reserves are controlled either through direct ownership or through leasing arrangements which generally last until the recoverable reserves are depleted 
depletion of reserves and amortization of mine development costs is computed using the units of production method over the estimated recoverable tons 
costs related to locating coal deposits and determining the extractive feasibility of such deposits are expensed as incurred 
exclusive of approximately million of net property  plant  equipment  and mine development  that we had recorded as of december   was approximately million of mining equipment classified as assets held for sale 
this equipment was sold in january for a small gain 
we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators are present and the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  the carrying values are reduced to the estimated fair value 
asset retirement obligation 
the surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes require that mine properties be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines  and sealing portals at underground mines 
reclamation activities that are performed outside of the normal mining process are accounted for as asset retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
we record our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and estimated reclamation obligations for such mines as determined by third party engineering estimates 
in accordance with sfas  we determine the fair value of our asset retirement obligations using a discounted cash flow methodology based on a discount rate related to the rates of us treasury bonds with maturities similar to the expected life of a mine  adjusted for our credit standing 
in estimating future cash flows  we consider third party profit and apply inflation factors as required by sfas on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures  and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  to reflect current experience 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation using statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we currently use a standard option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
sfas r requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments  including employee stock options  at fair value and is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after december  we adopted this standard effective january  and have elected the modified prospective application transition method 
under the modified prospective application transition method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
awards granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas r with the exception that compensation expense related to unvested options must be recognized in the income statement based on the fair value of the options on the date of grant 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
mineral reserves 
we amortize our acquisition costs  development costs  capitalized asset retirement costs and some plant and equipment using the units of production method and estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves 
we review these estimates on a regular basis and adjust them to reflect our current mining plans 
the rate at which we record depletion also depends on the estimates of our reserves 
if the estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion increases 
such a decline in reserves may result from geological conditions  coal quality  effects of governmental  environmental and tax regulations  and assumptions about future prices and future operating costs 

table of contents accounting for income taxes 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million 
if not utilized  these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire at various dates beginning in the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
in the event we have a change in ownership in the future  utilization of these carryforwards could be limited 
a valuation allowance has been established to reserve the potential benefits of these carryforwards in our financial statements to reflect the uncertainty of future taxable income required to utilize available tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense  which was for  and there are no income tax examinations currently in process

xinergy for million in cash in accordance with the terms and conditions of a purchase agreement entered into among the parties on february  
table of contents production during the year ended december  and  our mines produced  and  tons of coal  respectively  as follows twelve months ended december  change surface mines highwall mines underground mines total tons produced coal purchased total tons available the figures above include  tons produced by national coal of alabama  inc and  tons produced by our straight creek mining operations that were sold in march the figures above include  tons produced by national coal of alabama  inc and  tons produced by our straight creek mining operations 
revenue during the years ended december  and  approximately and of coal sales were made to four utilities and four industrial customers under contracts and open purchase order arrangements with original terms of twelve months or longer 
the remaining coal sales for the period were made under short term contracts or purchase orders 
tons sold and the associated revenue for the period ended follows twelve months ended december  increase decrease coal sales tons sold average price per ton sold other revenues during the twelve months ended december   we generated all of our coal sales revenue from twenty seven customers  six of which were electric utilities  twenty of which were industrial companies and one was a coal reseller 
most of our coal sales are derived from contracts of twelve months or longer and open purchase order arrangements with long standing customers 
the increase in revenue from coal sales for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily the result of i the addition of national coal of alabama  which sold  tons of coal during the period at an average price of per ton as compared to  tons of coal sold during the at an average price of per ton  and ii the average selling price for coal sold from the company s tennessee operations increased from per ton sold during the period to per ton sold during the period  while tons sold increased from  tons in to  tons in  reduced by iii the sale of the straight creek mining operations  which sold  tons at an average price of during the period as compared to  tons sold during the period at an average price of per ton 

table of contents the increase in other revenues of million consisted primarily of i revenue from a contract mining services agreement between xinergy and national coal corporation to mine coal from a highwall mine previously sold to xinergy as part of the straight creek sale on march  ii through put fees charged to another coal producer for use of our train loading facilities in southeast kentucky  which were sold on march   and cost of sales twelve months ended december  increase decrease cost of sales tons sold average cost per ton sold cost of services total cost of sales increased during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due primarily to i the addition of national coal of alabama  which sold  tons of coal at an average cost of per ton sold compared to only  tons sold during at an average cost of per ton sold 
the increase in average cost per ton sold is due principally to increased per ton costs in the areas of labor  purchased coal  freight and hauling  explosives and royalty fees 
additionally  the march mechanical failure of our dragline equipment resulted in lost production and corresponding revenues of approximately  tons and million  respectively  during the year ended december   further tightening our margins in alabama 
ii our tennessee mines sold  tons at an average cost per ton sold of per ton for the year ended december  compared to  tons at an average cost per ton sold of for the year ended december  this increased cost per ton sold of is due principally to i increased per ton labor cost  ii increased per ton diesel fuel cost  iii increase per ton contract labor cost  iv increase per ton worker s compensation cost  due principally to an outlier claim in  and v increase per ton explosives costs 
iii the aforementioned increases were offset by the sale of our kentucky operations  which sold  tons at a cost of per ton for the year ended december  compared to  tons sold at a cost of per ton for the same period in the increase in cost of services is due to the contract mining agreement between xinergy and national coal corporation to mine coal from a highwall mine previously sold to xinergy as part of the straight creek sale on march  
table of contents depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expense twelve months ended december  increase decrease depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion tons sold average cost per ton sold the decrease in depreciation  depletion  amortization  and accretion expense for the year ended december  as compared to the comparable period in  is attributable primarily to i the sale of approximately million in property  plant  equipment  and mine development  and a resulting decrease of million of corresponding expense  associated with the sale of the straight creek properties on march  ii the reduction in expense of approximately million for tennessee  principally due to assets that were fully depreciated in iii the addition of national coal of alabama which sold  tons of coal during the period with an associated average cost of depreciation  depletion  amortization  and accretion per ton of  or million of corresponding expense compared to million in expense or average cost of depreciation  depletion  amortization  and accretion of per ton during the period 
the decrease in per ton sold is due principally to a million gain on settlement of asset retirement obligations recorded in general and administrative expenses twelve months ended december  increase decrease general and administrative expense tons sold average cost per ton sold the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the previous year is primarily attributable to i the increase in expenses of million associated with national coal of alabama with total general and administrative expenses of million in including approximately million in bad debt and professional fees of million compared to million in ii the addition of estimated legal settlement fees of million  bad debt of million and professional fees of million offset by the reduction in insurance fees of million  purchased coal fees of million and engineering consulting fees of million in our tennessee operations

coal sales attributable to our tennessee and kentucky operations are as follows twelve months ended december  increase decrease coal sales tons sold average price per ton sold 
table of contents the approximately million decline in revenue from coal sales from our tennessee and kentucky operations in was partially the result of an  ton decline in shipments as existing sales agreements expired and sales opportunities at attractive prices were unavailable  in conjunction with a per ton decline in average sales price as a result of a softening coal market over the late and early to mid period 
two years of unseasonably mild weather resulted in decreased demand for coal reducing prices during those periods 
the increase in other revenues of  is primarily due to the increase in receipt of loading fees of  from a coal company with property located adjacent to our straight creek  kentucky operations which were sold on march  operating expenses twelve months ended december  increase decrease cost of sales depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expense general and administrative expenses cost of sales twelve months ended december  increase decrease cost of sales tons sold average cost per ton sold cost of sales consisted primarily of salary  benefits  and other compensation costs paid directly to miners  and direct costs paid to third party vendors whose goods and services were directly used in the process of producing coal inventory 
third party vendor costs include equipment leases and maintenance costs  blasting costs  fuel costs  parts and supplies  coal purchases  and transportation costs 
nca incurred  in cost of sales from october through december  increased consolidated cost of sales 
at our tennessee and kentucky operation  we experienced a million decrease in cost of sales  or when compared to on a per ton basis  cost of sales at our tennessee and kentucky operation increased or when compared to during  our tennessee and kentucky operations produced  fewer tons than in relying instead on increased purchases of coal from third parties 
as a result  overall production costs at these operations decreased million  offset by a million increase in the cost of purchased coal 
we experienced significant increases in the prices we pay for the products and services we use in our operations such as diesel fuel  tires  blasting services  roof bolts  health insurance  workers compensation costs and the per ton fees we pay to contract miners 
however  by placing less reliance on contract miners and producing more tons on owned reserves in the new river tract which do not result in royalty payments to lessors we were able to minimize the effect of the increases on our per ton cost of sales to only excluding a per ton increase in the cost of sales effect of purchased coal 

table of contents depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expense twelve months ended december  increase decrease depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion tons sold average cost per ton sold nca reflected depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expenses from october through december  of  at our tennessee and kentucky operations  we experienced a  decrease in depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expenses or when compared to on a per ton basis  depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expenses increased by  or approximately when compared to due to the decline in tons sold 
the decrease in expense is primarily attributable to the late sale leaseback of a highwall miner and to certain equipment still in service which was fully depreciated during this was offset by capital expenditures of approximately million in general and administrative expenses twelve months ended december  increase decrease general and administrative expense tons sold average cost per ton sold general and administrative expenses primarily include non operations salary  benefits and related expenses  consulting expenses  legal and professional fees  insurance expenses  and travel and travel related expenses 
nca reflected incremental general and administrative expenses from october through december  of  at our tennessee and kentucky operations  we experienced a million decrease in general and administrative expenses or when compared to on a per ton basis  general and administrative expenses at our tennessee and kentucky operations decreased by  or when compared to general and administrative expenses decreased during the period due to targeted efforts to reduce cost 
general and administrative labor decreased approximately million primarily due to the accelerated vesting of stock options in and a decline in base wages at the corporate level 
other significant reductions were made in consulting and professional services  facilities and security  insurance costs  and travel

at december   we had stockholders equity of million and incurred net losses of million excluding preferred stock dividends for the year then ended 
management expects that we may continue to incur net losses in the future  which would decrease stockholders equity and could lead to an eventual stockholders deficit 
management believes that we have sufficient resources to fund our operations through however  this belief is predicated on certain assumptions as to i sales volumes and related pricing  ii production levels  iii the availability of coal to be purchased at a reasonable price  iv budgeted capital expenditures  and v cost per ton level decreases at existing mines and newly opened mines 
significant deviation from any one of these assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows and the ability for our wholly owned subsidiary national coal of alabama  inc nca to meet certain debt covenants 
management believes that nca will be in compliance with its debt covenants during however  there can be no assurances that a debt covenant violation will not occur  or that we will have sufficient cash to satisfy our obligations 

table of contents the agreements governing our outstanding senior debt impose a number of restrictions  the most significant of which is the inability to loan funds or infuse capital between nca and national coal corp 
additionally  the terms of our credit facilities contain financial and other covenants that create limitations on our ability to affect acquisitions or dispositions  incur additional debt and may require us to maintain various financial ratios and comply with various other financial covenants 
in the second  third and fourth quarters of  nca failed to meet certain financial covenants required under its notes due in each instance  waivers of covenant failures and modifications of future financial covenants were obtained 
with respect to the second and fourth quarter waivers only  nca was charged penalties of  each quarter for covenant waiver and modification 
nca s ability to comply with these restrictions may be affected by events beyond its control and  as a result  it may be unable to comply with these restrictions 
a failure to comply with these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to borrow under a new credit facility or result in an event of default under these agreements 
in the event of a default  nca s lenders could terminate their commitments to them and declare all amounts borrowed  together with accrued interest and fees  immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  nca might not be able to pay these amounts  or could be forced to seek an amendment to its financing arrangements which could make the terms of these arrangements more onerous 
as of december   neither we nor nca have a revolving credit agreement for working capital in place 
we rely primarily on our ability to generate cash from operations to service our debt 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service  we may need to seek additional financing  the availability of which is uncertain given the current state of credit markets and restrictions in the company s existing borrowing agreements 
the company s financial condition at the time additional funds are being sought may also impact the availability of credit 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us amidst the tightening credit market  we could be forced to raise equity financing or sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances 
the notes due and the notes due limit our ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of the proceeds from any such sale 
however  these debt facilities do allow asset sales if the funds generated from such sales are used to pay outstanding debt and prepayment costs associated with these debt obligations 
even if asset sales are permitted  we may not be able to sell assets in a timely manner or for sufficient amounts to enable them to meet our debt obligations 
we do not believe that we will be able to generate from operations the amount of cash necessary to pay in december the principal amounts of our notes due the outstanding principal balance of this indebtedness at december  was  we intend to refinance this indebtedness prior to its maturity by incurring additional debt  the availability of which is uncertain given the current state of credit markets 
if we are unable to refinance this indebtedness  we would be required to repay this indebtedness from other sources  including cash raised from equity financings or sales of assets  which may occur under unfavorable circumstances 
during the year ended december   we generated total revenues of million and sold approximately million tons of coal 
our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of coal to electric utility companies and industrial customers in the southeastern united states pursuant to long term contracts or open purchase order arrangements with long time customers 
long term contracts as are customary in the industry  are those with a contract duration of one year or more 
our largest customers were georgia power  alabama power  and solutia  inc  representing approximately  and of its revenues  respectively 
during  we successfully renegotiated several of our existing coal supply agreements resulting in an increased selling price per ton and additional revenues from those contracts 
the weighted average selling price per ton is   and on million  million  and million tons contracted for   and  respectively 
we typically sell our coal for a specified per ton amount and at a negotiated price pursuant to both short term contracts and contracts of twelve months or greater 
for the year ended december   of sales were pursuant to contracts of twelve months or greater 
price adjustment  price reopener and other similar provisions in long term supply agreements may reduce the protection from short term coal price volatility traditionally provided by such contracts 
any adjustment or renegotiation leading to a significantly lower contract price would result in decreased revenues and lower gross margins  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows 
additionally  our customers may have the ability to delay the timing of their purchases  which could negatively impact operating cash flows 
finally  coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or our customers during the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party 

table of contents we have not yet priced a portion of the coal we have the capability of producing over the next several years in order to take advantage of possible future market demand or to realize possible long term opportunities with certain users of the high quality coal contained in our reserve base 
at december   our un priced and uncommitted future production was approximately million to million tons in  million to million tons in  and million tons in for  we have assumed we will be able to achieve a minimum spot rate on unpriced tons 
if we are unable to obtain this rate  we will reduce production 
we assume we will meet our contract commitments through a combination of produced tons and purchased coal 
our ability to produce tons can be negatively impacted by weather  labor shortages or equipment breakdowns 
additionally  geological and mining conditions may not be fully identified by available exploration data or may differ from experience in current operations 
during  we experienced severe increases in diesel fuel and costs associated with all petroleum related products and also encountered additional regulatory examination  as did most of our competitors  that weakened productivity 
the company experienced equipment failure in which negatively impacted the tons of coal produced and therefore sold 
additionally  coal for purchase may not be available  or available only at unfavorable prices 
the occurrence of such events can adversely affect production  the cost of sales or both  and could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows 
we invested approximately million in equipment and mine development during the year ended december  including million purchased through equipment financing arrangements 
management has estimated capital expenditures for to be million to expand operations and approximately million to maintain existing assets 
we expect to finance million of these capital expenditures in if financing is unable to be obtained  this could negatively impact planned production levels 
during the first quarter of  our dragline equipment utilized in our l 
massey surface mine in alabama suffered a major mechanical failure 
the equipment has since been repaired and was back in production during the third quarter of this breakdown resulted in estimated lost production of  tons and lost revenues of million during the year ended december  in prior years  we also experienced the unanticipated loss of the use of a highwall miner  which resulted in lost production and lost revenues 
we may experience similar mechanical failures in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows 
acquisition of mann steel products  inc on october   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of mann steel products for an aggregate purchase price of  in cash  paid primarily to the sellers except for  which was retained to repay certain indebtedness of mann steel that existed at closing 
mann steel became a wholly owned subsidiary of ncc corp 
and changed its name to national coal of alabama  inc the purchase agreement required a working capital adjustment to the purchase price within days after closing 
the working capital adjustment required that a determination be made by the seller s accounting firm as to the value of working capital  or current assets minus current liabilities  at the closing date  and that the purchase price be increased to the extent working capital exceeded zero  or decreased to the extent working capital was less than zero 
as a result of this provision  nca paid  to the sellers on december  total cash consideration was  which includes acquisition costs of we funded the acquisition through the combination of two transactions a a sale of  shares of national coal corp

approximately million of equipment related debt was assumed by xinergy corp 
on march   as a result of the sale of our straight creek  kentucky properties 
cash flows we currently satisfy our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations and sales of debt and equity securities 
for the twelve months ended december   we had a net decrease in cash of approximately million 
cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities for the twelve months ended december    and are summarized in the following table twelve months ended december  activity in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash operating activities the net cash used in operating activities of approximately million during the year ended december  compared with prior year cash used in operations of million was primarily attributable to the current period activity including a full year of operating results for national coal of alabama while only being offset by three months of operating losses associated with the straight creek mining operations 
the comparable period in the prior year includes straight creek operating losses and included national coal of alabama operations for only three months 
however  in the first quarter of  our dragline equipment utilized in our l 
massey surface mine in alabama suffered a major mechanical failure 
the equipment was repaired and was back in full production on july  this breakdown resulted in estimated lost production of  tons and lost revenues of million during the year ended december   respectively 
the net cash used in operating activities of approximately million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a net loss over of million along with the acquisition of mann steel products  inc on october  net of gains on the sale of idle assets including certain of our mineral properties at pine mountain  kentucky and an increase in inventory  accounts receivable and depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion 
we expect to have positive cash flows from operations in  which is important for our ability to continue as a going concern 
net cash used in operating activities of approximately million during the year ended december  was primarily the result of an increase in net loss  net of depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion and non cash stock option expense  of million 
the increase was primarily due to lower contract prices  increased purchases of coal due in part to the highwall miner damage during the year  and the termination of a financially favorable agreement with a subcontractor for the management of our kentucky properties  partially offset by increased non cash stock option expenses of million over prior year due to the adoption of sfas r and the accelerated vesting of certain executive options 
offsetting the overall decrease in cash flow from operations is a greater increase in accounts payable of million primarily attributable to the refurbishment of our baldwin preparation plant and load out facility which took place in and increased interest due to higher debt balances

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risks our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us at december   we had million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and no debt under variable rate instruments 
at december   we had million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and no debt under variable rate instruments 
commodity risks we are subject to commodity price risk based on the fluctuating market price of coal 
we manage this risk through securing long term coal supply agreements rather than through use of derivative instruments 
in the future  as existing long term contracts expire or become subject to repricing  our coal sales will be made at then current market prices 
as a result  our revenues and net income will be significantly affected by fluctuations in the price of coal 
coal prices are influenced by a number of factors and vary dramatically by region 
the two principal components of the delivered price of coal are the price of coal at the mine  which is influenced by coal quality  and the cost of transporting coal from the mine to the point of use 
electricity generators purchase coal on the basis of its delivered cost per million btu 
as macroeconomic factors affect these commodity prices  the price of coal will similarly be impacted 

table of contents the cost of operating a mine is influenced by geological characteristics such as seam thickness  overburden ratios and depth of underground reserves 
it is generally cheaper to mine coal seams that are thick and located close to the surface than to mine thin underground seams 
typically  coal mining operations will begin at the part of the coal seam that is easiest and most economical to mine 
as the seam is mined  it becomes more difficult and expensive to mine because the seam either becomes thinner or extends more deeply into the earth  requiring removal of more overburden 
underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of high capital costs including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems and higher labor costs  including costs for labor benefits and health care 
in addition to the cost of mine operations  the price of coal at the mine is also a function of quality characteristics such as heat value and sulfur  ash and moisture content 
coal used for domestic consumption is generally sold freight on board at a loading point  and the purchaser normally pays the transportation costs 
export coal is usually sold at an export terminal  and the seller is responsible for shipment to the export coal loading facility while the purchaser pays the ocean freight 
most electric power generators arrange long term shipping contracts with rail or barge companies to assure stable delivery costs 
transportation cost can be a large component of the purchaser s cost 
although the customer pays the freight  transportation cost is still important to coal mining companies because the customer may choose a supplier largely based on the cost of transportation 
trucks and overland conveyors haul coal over shorter distances  while lake carriers and ocean vessels move coal to export markets 
some domestic coal is shipped over the great lakes 
railroads typically handle approximately of us coal production  with csx and norfolk southern the dominant carriers in the eastern united states 
some products used in mining activities  such as diesel fuel  are subject to price volatility 
we use short term fuel contracts to manage the volatility related to this exposure 
foreign currency all of our transactions are denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risk
