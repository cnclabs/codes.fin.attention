financing transactions due to the fund s status as a licensed sbic  the fund has the ability to issue debentures guaranteed by the sba at favorable interest rates 
under the small business investment act and the sba rules applicable to sbics  an sbic or group of sbics under common control can have outstanding at any time debentures guaranteed by the sba in an amount up to twice the amount of its regulatory capital  which generally is the amount raised from private investors

current market conditions during  the debt and equity capital markets in the united states have been severely impacted by significant write offs in the financial services sector relating to subprime mortgages and the re pricing of credit 
table of contents risk in the broadly syndicated bank loan market  among other things 
these events  along with the deterioration of the housing market  have led to an economic recession in the u 
s and abroad  which could be long term 
banks and others in the financial services industry have continued to report significant write downs in the fair value of their assets  which has led to the failure of a number of banks and investment companies  a number of distressed mergers and acquisitions  the government take over of the nation s two largest government sponsored mortgage companies  and the passage of the billion emergency economic stabilization of in early october these events have significantly impacted the financial and credit markets and have reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole  and for financial firms in particular 
while we have capacity to issue additional sba guaranteed debentures as discussed above  we may not be able to access additional equity capital  which could result in the slowing of our origination activity during and beyond 
in the event that the united states economy remains in a recession  it is possible that the results of some of the middle market companies in which we invest could experience deterioration  which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting debt service requirements and an increase in defaults 
while we are not seeing signs of an overall  broad deterioration in our portfolio company results at this time  there can be no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic conditions which could have a negative impact on our future results 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by such financial statements 
we have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the matters described below 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies follows 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
we have established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a recurring quarterly basis 
as discussed below  we have engaged an independent valuation firm to assist us in our valuation process 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability  that is  the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability is a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability 
sfas provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on exit price and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
in addition  sfas provides a framework for measuring fair value  and establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the three levels of valuation hierarchy established by sfas are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 

table of contents level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
we invest primarily in debt and equity of privately held companies for which quoted prices falling within the categories of level and level inputs are not available 
therefore  we value all of our investments at fair value  as determined in good faith by our board of directors  using level inputs  as further described below 
due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process  our board of directors estimate of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
in addition  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded and for which a limited market does not exist are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith  as fair value depends upon circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security 
we evaluate the investments in portfolio companies using the most recently available portfolio company financial statements and forecasts 
we also consult with the portfolio company s senior management to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance  including information such as industry trends  new product development and other operational issues 
additionally  we consider some or all of the following factors financial standing of the issuer of the security  comparison of the business and financial plan of the issuer with actual results  the size of the security held as it relates to the liquidity of the market for such security  pending public offering of common stock by the issuer of the security  pending reorganization activity affecting the issuer  such as merger or debt restructuring  ability of the issuer to obtain needed financing  changes in the economy affecting the issuer  financial statements and reports from portfolio company senior management and ownership  the type of security  the security s cost at the date of purchase and any contractual restrictions on the disposition of the security  discount from market value of unrestricted securities of the same class at the time of purchase  special reports prepared by analysts  information as to any transactions or offers with respect to the security and or sales to third parties of similar securities  the issuer s ability to make payments and the type of collateral  the current and forecasted earnings of the issuer  statistical ratios compared to lending standards and to other similar securities  and other pertinent factors 

table of contents in making the good faith determination of the value of debt securities  we start with the cost basis of the security  which includes the amortized original issue discount  and payment in kind pik interest  if any 
we also use a risk rating system to estimate the probability of default on the debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default 
the risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities held 
in valuing debt securities  we utilize an income approach model that considers factors including  but not limited to  i the portfolio investment s current risk rating discussed below  ii the portfolio company s current trailing twelve months ttm results of operations as compared to the portfolio company s ttm results of operations as of the date the investment was made  iii the portfolio company s current leverage as compared to its leverage as of the date the investment was made  and iv current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed and executed investment transactions 
in valuing equity securities of private companies  we consider valuation methodologies consistent with industry practice  including i valuation using a valuation model based on original transaction multiples and the portfolio company s recent financial performance  ii valuation of the securities based on recent sales in comparable transactions  and iii a review of similar companies that are publicly traded and the market multiple of their equity securities 
unrealized appreciation or depreciation on portfolio investments are recorded as increases or decreases in investments on the balance sheets and are separately reflected on the statements of operations in determining net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations 
duff phelps  llc duff phelps  an independent valuation firm  provides third party valuation consulting services to us  which consist of certain limited procedures that we identified and requested duff phelps to perform hereinafter referred to as the procedures 
we generally request duff phelps to perform the procedures on each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year and for new portfolio companies  at least once in the twelve month period subsequent to the initial investment 
in certain instances  we may determine that it is not cost effective  and as a result is not in our stockholders best interest  to request duff phelps to perform the procedures on one or more portfolio companies 
such instances include  but are not limited to  situations where the fair value of our investment in the portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to our total investment portfolio 
for the quarter ended march   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in five portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of march  for the quarter ended june   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in five portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of june  for the quarter ended september   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in five portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of september  for the quarter ended december   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in six portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of december  for the quarter ended march   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in six portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of march  for the quarter ended june   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in five portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of june  for the quarter ended september   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in eight portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of september  for the quarter ended december   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in eight portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of december  upon completion of the procedures  duff phelps concluded that the fair value  as determined by the board of directors  of those investments subjected

our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our investments in good faith 
revenue recognition interest and dividend income interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of original issue discount  is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
generally  when interest and or principal payments on a loan become past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal and interest has been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible 
we write off any previously accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that interest is no longer considered collectible 
dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date 
fee income loan origination  facility  commitment  consent and other advance fees received by us on loan agreements or other investments are recorded as deferred income and recognized as income over the term of the loan 
payment in kind interest pik we currently hold  and we expect to hold in the future  some loans in our portfolio that contain a pik interest provision 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan  rather than being paid to us in cash  and recorded as interest income 
to maintain our status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
generally  when current cash interest and or principal payments on a loan become past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and will generally cease recognizing pik interest income on that loan until all principal and interest has been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible 
we write off any accrued and uncollected pik interest when it is determined that the pik interest is no longer collectible 
recently issued accounting standards on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to previous practice resulting from the application of sfas relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the definition of fair value retains the exchange price notion used in earlier definitions of fair value 
sfas clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability  that is  the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability is a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability

in addition  sfas provides a framework for measuring fair value  and establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
our adoption of sfas resulted in additional unrealized depreciation of approximately million in the three months ended march  see note to our financial statements for a further discussion of the impact of 
table of contents the adoption of sfas on our financial statements and for expanded disclosures about our fair value measurements 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have no off balance sheet arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility  variability of spread relationships  the difference in re pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing debt and liabilities 
changes in interest rates can also affect  among other things  our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio 
our investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates 
we regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk and determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we were not a party to any hedging arrangements 
as of december   approximately  or million of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at fixed rates and approximately  or million of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates 
a basis point decrease in the interest rates on our variable rate debt investments would decrease our investment income by approximately million on an annual basis 
all of our pooled sba debentures bear interest at fixed rates 
because we currently borrow  and plan to borrow in the future  money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
in periods of rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by floating rate assets in our investment portfolio
