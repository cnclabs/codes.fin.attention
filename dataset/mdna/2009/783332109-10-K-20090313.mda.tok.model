key financial terms and metrics we evaluate our business using a variety of key financial measures restaurant sales 
restaurant sales consist of food and beverage sales by company owned restaurants 
restaurant sales are primarily influenced by total operating weeks in the relevant period and comparable restaurant sales growth 
total operating weeks is the total number of company owned restaurants multiplied by the number of weeks each is in operation during the relevant period 
total operating weeks is impacted by restaurant openings and closings  as well as changes in the number of weeks included in the relevant period 
comparable restaurant sales growth reflects the change in year over year or quarter over quarter  as applicable  sales for the comparable restaurant base 
we define the comparable restaurant base to be those company owned restaurants in operation for not less than fifteen months prior to the beginning of the fiscal quarter including the period being measured 
comparable restaurant sales growth is primarily influenced by the number of entr es sold and the average guest check 
the number of entrees sold is influenced by the popularity of our menu items  our guest mix  our ability to deliver a high quality dining experience and overall economic conditions 
average guest check  a measure of total restaurant sales divided by the number of entr es  is driven by menu mix and pricing 
franchise income

other operating income includes banquet related guarantee and services revenue and other incidental guest fees as well as other licensing fees and income and discounts associated with the sale of gift cards 
while we always honor gift cards  even beyond any stated expiration dates on the card and as required in several jurisdictions  our historical experience has shown that very few cards are redeemed after months following the issue date 
as such  we record in other operating income the full remaining value original issue less any partial redemptions of any gift cards unredeemed after months from the date of last activity  subject to limitations in some jurisdictions in which we operate 
food and beverage costs

potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors 
see risk factors  which discloses certain material risks that could affect its quarterly operating results 
our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  the percentages of our annual total revenues during the first and fourth fiscal quarters have been higher due  in part  to the year end holiday season 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year  and comparable restaurant sales for any particular period may decrease 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decrease

during the fiscal quarter ended december   we recorded a loss on impairment of long lived assets in the amount of million 
these charges were related to the full impairment of fixtures and equipment and leasehold improvements at one mitchell s steakhouse  two mitchell s fish market locations  three company owned ruth s chris steak house restaurants and our millwork shop located in sanford  florida

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash during fiscal were net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our senior credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash during fiscal included the acquisition of the mitchell s restaurants  capital expenditures and debt service 
we expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be to service debt 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we anticipated  due to declining comparable restaurant sales  a breach of our maximum consolidated leverage ratio as of december  as a result  we began negotiations with our bank group  and on february   we signed an amendment reducing the revolving loan commitment from million to million  with additional reductions scheduled beginning december  through the final maturity date of february  the amendment decreases our fixed charge coverage ratio and increases our maximum consolidated leverage ratio  in each case beginning with the fourth quarter of and continuing through the second quarter of  after which these two covenants reset to their original levels

on august   we completed a second amendment to our senior credit facility to increase our availability under the facility to million 
our ability to request additional funding through the revolving credit facility also increased with this amendment to million  for a total potential borrowing of million 
the amendment also provided that million in proceeds may be utilized to repurchase our common stock  extended the maturity date of the outstanding principal from march  to august   and changed the maximum consolidated leverage ratio in the financial covenants to 
all other financial covenants  restrictive covenants and terms of the increased revolving credit facility remained unchanged 
on september   we entered into a three year interest rate swap to limit the variability of our interest payments 
the notional amounts total million through september   million through september  and million through its expiration on september  of the then outstanding debt under our senior credit facility 
previously  we had two interest rate swaps in place that were terminated as a result of this new transaction 
we do not use hedge accounting to account for this swap 
the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts were recorded to interest expense 
on february   we amended and restated our existing credit facility to increase the revolving loan commitment to million 
the amended and restated credit extended the maturity date of the outstanding principal from march  to february   and changed the maximum consolidated leverage ratio in the financial covenants to

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements is based  in part  on our critical accounting policies that require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements 
our significant accounting policies  which may be affected by our estimates and assumptions  are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in item critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the combined financial statements 
equipment and leasehold improvements equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
equipment consists primarily of restaurant equipment  furniture  fixtures and smallwares 
depreciation is generally calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term  including renewal periods  or the estimated useful life of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred  renewals and betterments are capitalized 
estimated useful lives are generally as follows equipment to years  furniture and fixtures to years 
judgments and estimates made by us related to the expected useful lives of these assets are affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets 
impairment of long lived assets we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flow and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant level for indicators of permanent impairment 
in determining future cash flows  we make significant estimates with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term 
if assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets 
during the fiscal quarter ended december   we recorded a loss on impairment of long lived assets in the amount of million 
these charges were related to the full impairment of fixtures and equipment and leasehold improvements at one mitchell s steakhouse  two mitchell s fish market locations  three company owned ruth s chris steak house restaurants and our millwork shop located in sanford  florida 
in addition  we recorded a partial loss on impairment of fixtures and equipment and leasehold improvements at one mitchell s fish market location  two company owned ruth s chris steak house restaurants and our corporate office building located in heathrow  florida 
goodwill  franchise rights and trademarks goodwill and other indefinite lived assets resulted primarily from our acquisition of franchisee owned restaurants 
the most significant acquisitions were completed in    and goodwill  trademarks and franchise rights with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization 
however  such assets must be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually 
we completed the most recent impairment test in december  and determined that impairment losses related to goodwill and other indefinite lived assets in the amount of million should be recorded 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived assets  market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the estimated future cash flows were projected using significant assumptions  including future revenues and expenses  and potential unit growth 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
insurance liability we maintain various insurance policies for workers compensation  employee health  general liability  and property damage 
pursuant to those policies  we are responsible for losses up to certain limits and are required to estimate a liability that represents our ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits 
this liability is based on management s estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical trends  actuarial assumptions  and economic conditions 
if actual trends differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities resulted in a net deferred tax asset  an evaluation is made of the probability of our ability to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of such net deferred tax will generally depend on whether we will have sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character within the carry forward period permitted by the tax law 
without sufficient taxable income to offset the deductible amounts and carry forwards  the related tax benefits will expire unused 
we have evaluated both positive and negative evidence in making a determination as to whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
measurement of deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
share based compensation fas r requires the recognition of compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income related to the fair value of employee share based options 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise and the expected dividends 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
prior to adopting fas r  we applied apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans 
all employee stock options were granted at or above the grant date market price 
accordingly  no compensation cost was recognized for fixed stock option grants in prior to the adoption of fas r  we presented the tax savings resulting from tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 classification in the statement of cash flows of the income tax benefit received by a company upon exercise of a nonqualified employee stock option 
fas r requires us to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow related to certain stock option transactions 
recent accounting pronouncements for future application in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  sfas r  a replacement of sfas no 
 business combinations 
the provisions of sfas no 
r establish principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in it financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest acquired and the goodwill acquired 
sfas no 
r also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination  and applies to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after december   and may not be early adopted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
r will have on the consolidated financial statements and expects the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet  statements of income or cash flows 
other accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for variable rate debt  including borrowings under the company s senior credit facility  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   the company had million of variable rate debt of which million has been converted to fixed rates through the use of interest rate swaps 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  a hypothetical immediate one percentage point change in interest rates would be expected to have an impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for fiscal of approximately million 
the company has an interest rate swap to manage its exposure on its debt facility 
by using the interest rate swap to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  the company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes the company  which creates credit risk for the company 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative  the company owes the counterparty and  therefore  it does not possess credit risk 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates 
the market risk associated with interest rate contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
during fiscal  interest expense included a million mark to market non cash charge related to an interest rate swap 
foreign currency risk in accordance with the company s franchise agreements relating to the company s international locations  the company receives royalties from those franchisees in us dollars  and therefore the company believes that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates do not present a material risk to its operations 
commodity price risk the company is exposed to market price fluctuations in beef and other food product prices 
given the historical volatility of beef and other food product prices  this exposure can impact the company s food and beverage costs 
as the company typically sets its menu prices in advance of its beef and other food product purchases  the company cannot quickly take into account changing costs of beef and other food items 
to the extent that the company is unable to pass the increased costs on to its guests through price increases  the company s results of operations would be adversely affected 
in fiscal  the company has negotiated set pricing for approximately of its prime beef requirements  which represents of its beef purchases 
the company currently does not use financial instruments to hedge its risk to market price fluctuations in other food product prices 
effects of inflation components of the company s operations subject to inflation include food  beverage  lease and labor costs 
the company s leases require it to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
the company believes inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations in recent years
