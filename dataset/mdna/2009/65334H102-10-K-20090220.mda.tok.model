we have presented our working interest before royalties as we measure our performance on this basis consistent with other canadian oil and gas companies 
long term debt and short term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents 
production before royalties averaged  boe d in  slightly below last year s volumes 
higher rates at buzzard were offset by declines at our maturing yemen properties and hurricane interruptions in the gulf of mexico 
buzzard continues to operate reliably and production in averaged  boe d  boe d net to us 
we expect our consolidated production rates will increase in primarily as a result of new volumes from our long lake project  ettrick in the uk north sea and longhorn in the gulf of mexico 
we achieved record financial results in  generating cash flow from operating activities in excess of billion and net income of billion 
commodity prices reached new highs during the year  but fell in the fourth quarter as a result of the global economic crisis 
wti crude oil averaged us bbl for the year  higher than last year 
despite the fall in crude oil and gas prices in the last part of the year  the strengthening us dollar kept our price realizations strong 
much of our production has low operating costs and low royalties 
our cash netbacks continue to be among the highest in the industry  averaging boe after royalties for the year 
high netbacks deliver superior relative performance even as commodity prices decline 
the past year proved challenging for our energy marketing group as unprecedented market conditions impacted physical market fundamentals and the pricing relationships we successfully positioned ourselves to profit from historically 
while the global economic slowdown produced challenges for our business  the marketing team was most impacted by significant swings in commodity markets 
we were positioned to take advantage of normal market fundamentals but these were overwhelmed by significant price movements  increased volatility and the economic slowdown 
since the middle of the year  we have been refocusing this division and reducing the size of our trading levels 
in response to the rapidly deteriorating economic environment and financial markets  we were carefully choosing our exit points 
with the gas trading positions we recently exited  the refocusing of our gas marketing business back to physical transportation and storage is now complete 
our net income includes impairment expense of million before tax related to properties in the uk north sea and the gulf of mexico 
these properties were impaired by lower commodity prices  lower reserve estimates and unexpected costs 
we reduced our net debt by approximately billion with cash flow that exceeded our capital investment 
this was offset by the impact of a stronger us dollar which increased our us dollar denominated debt by billion at year end  and by repurchasing million common shares for approximately million 
our financial position is strong 
we have financial flexibility with major capital projects complete at buzzard and long lake  and industry leading cash netbacks 
we have liquidity of approximately billion after acquiring the additional long lake interest in january  comprised of cash on hand and undrawn committed credit 
we have no debt maturities until and the average term to maturity of our long term debt is approximately years

strategy progress cdn millions capital investment  including acquisitions proved oil and gas reserves before royalties mmboe proved oil and gas reserves after royalties mmboe proved syncrude reserves before royalties mmboe proved syncrude reserves after royalties mmboe includes developed and undeveloped proved reserves as at december our strategy is to build a sustainable energy company focused in three areas oil sands  unconventional gas and select conventional exploration and exploitation 
our investment in these areas generated the following results in oil sands the long lake project began producing bitumen and we completed construction and commissioning of the upgrader 
first production of premium synthetic crude from the upgrader began in january we continued to focus on our oil sands growth strategy by increasing our interest in long lake by to in early unconventional gas we have a significant land position in the horn river basin in northeast british columbia and started to test the area with exploration drilling and fracing activities 
we continued to explore and develop cbm opportunities in canada 
select conventional exploration and exploitation our conventional exploration program was focused in the us gulf of mexico and the uk north sea  which yielded four discoveries that provide opportunities for future growth 
during  our proved oil and gas and syncrude reserves additions replaced of our oil and gas and syncrude production after royalties 
excluding economic revisions  we replaced of our oil and gas and syncrude production after royalties 
the difference between before and after royalties reflect a reduction in the royalties on oil sands activities where the royalty rate is sensitive to prices 
before royalties mmboe oil and gas syncrude total production reserve changes excluding production net additions economic revisions after royalties mmboe oil and gas syncrude total production reserve changes excluding production net additions economic revisions the majority of our additions before economic revisions relate to activities at buzzard  long lake  masila and canadian cbm 
negative revisions occurred at ettrick as a result of disappointing drilling and testing results which caused us to reduce our expectations of recoverable reserves
