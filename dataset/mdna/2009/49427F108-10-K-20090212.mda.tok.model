item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
market risk we have elected to change our disclosure about market risk from a tabular presentation to a sensitivity analysis presentation because given the current economic environment we feel that a sensitivity analysis provides a more meaningful presentation of our exposure to market risk and facilitates comparison of our market risk to that of other reits 
at december   approximately of our total outstanding debt of billion was subject to variable interest rates 
the remaining bore interest at fixed interest rates 
all of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading purposes 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt are indexed to libor plus spreads of to at both december  and december  with the exception of the notes  we generally determine the fair value of our debt by performing discounted cash flow analyses using an appropriate market discount rate 
we calculate the market discount rate by obtaining period end treasury rates for fixed rate debt  or libor rates for variable rate debt  for maturities that correspond to the maturities of our debt and then adding an appropriate credit spread based on information obtained from third party financial institutions 
these credit spreads take into account our credit standing  the maturity of the debt  whether the debt is secured or unsecured and the loan to value ratios of the debt 
for the year ended december   we also added an additional basis points to this discount rate to adjust for the current liquidity risk inherent in the capital markets 
the total carrying value of our debt  excluding the notes  was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the total fair value of our debt  excluding the notes  was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of our debt  excluding the notes  of approximately million  or at december   and a basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of our debt of approximately million  or at december  the total carrying value of the notes was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the total fair value of the notes was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we determine the fair value of the notes  which are traded securities  based upon the closing trading price at the end of the period  or  if a closing trading price is not available  a bid ask spread from a third party broker  plus accrued interest 
for sensitivity purposes  a change in the trading price of the notes equates to a change in the total fair value of the notes of approximately million  or at december   and a change in the trading price of the notes equates to a change in the total fair value of the notes of approximately million  or at december  
table of contents for sensitivity purposes  a change in the trading price of our marketable securities equates to a change in the total fair value of the marketable securities of approximately million  or at december   and a change in the trading price of the marketable securities equates to a change in the total fair value of the marketable securities of approximately million  or at december  the above sensitivity analyses do not consider interrelationships between different market movements  which could result in additional changes in the fair value of our debt  notes and marketable securities beyond the amounts calculated
