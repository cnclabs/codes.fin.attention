item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on december   we issued a press release and held a conference call to review the results of operations for our fiscal year ended october  the information and estimates contained in this report are consistent with those given in the press release and on the conference call on december   and we are not reconfirming or updating that information 
unless otherwise stated  net contracts signed represents a number or value equal to the gross number or value of contracts signed during the relevant period  less the number or value of contracts cancelled during the relevant period  which includes contracts that were signed during the relevant period and in prior periods 
overview in fiscal and fiscal  we recognized billion of revenues and recorded a net loss of million and billion of revenues and a net loss of million  respectively 
in fiscal  we recognized billion of revenues and recorded net income of million 
the losses recognized in fiscal and fiscal  and the diminished earnings in fiscal  were due primarily to the recognition of inventory impairment charges and write offs  joint venture impairment charges and the negative impact on profit margins of higher sales incentives given on the homes delivered during each of the fiscal years 
the fiscal loss was also significantly impacted by million of valuation allowances recognized against our deferred tax assets 
the fiscal  and operating results were positively impacted by reduced inventory values due to impairments previously recognized 
the slowdown that we have experienced since fiscal has continued into fiscal the value of net contracts signed in fiscal was lower than the value of net contracts signed in fiscal and lower than the value of net contracts signed in fiscal the slowdown  which we believe started with a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes and an oversupply of homes available for sale  has been exacerbated by  among other things  a decline in the overall economy  increased unemployment  fear of job loss  a decline in home prices  the large number of homes that are or will be available due to foreclosures  the inability of some of our home buyers to sell their current home  the deterioration in the credit markets  and the direct and indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market 
we began to see some improvement in our business in late march  and the market appeared to be gaining momentum through early september  which we believe was due to improvement in consumer confidence over the prior year  the increasing stabilization of home prices  a decline in unsold home inventories and a reduction in buyer cancellation rates 
since september  however  demand has been choppy 
we believe that the key to a full recovery in our business is reliant upon a more significant return of consumer confidence and a sustained stabilization of financial markets and home prices 
the value and number of net contracts signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million and homes  respectively  an increase of and respectively  from the value and number of net contracts signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal these increases were achieved despite a significant reduction in the number of selling communities in fiscal  as compared to fiscal in addition  for the fourth quarter of fiscal  our contract cancellation rate the number of contracts cancelled in the period divided by the number of gross contracts signed in the period was  as compared to for the fiscal fourth quarter  for the full fiscal year and for the full fiscal year 
we continue to seek a balance between our short term goal of selling homes in a tough market and our long term goal of maximizing the value of our communities 
we continue to believe that many of our communities are in locations that are difficult to replace and in markets where approvals have been increasingly difficult to achieve 
we believe that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that may be realized in the future and that this value should not necessarily be sacrificed in the current soft market 
we continue to be concerned about the dislocation in the secondary mortgage industry 
we maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage financial institutions  many of which are among the largest and  we believe  most reliable in the industry 
we believe that regional and community banks continue to recognize the long term value in creating relationships with high quality  affluent customers such as our home buyers  and these banks continue to provide such customers with financing 
some of the major banks that had previously exited the market appear to be cautiously re entering it  but are not as aggressive as they once were 
nevertheless  tightened credit standards have shrunk the pool of potential home buyers and the availability of certain loan products previously available to our home buyers 
stricter mortgage underwriting guidelines  higher down payment requirements and narrower appraisal guidelines may impede some of our home buyers from closing  while others may find it more difficult to sell their existing homes as their prospective buyers may face difficulties obtaining a mortgage 
we believe that our home buyers generally are and should continue to be better able to secure mortgages  due to their typically lower loan to value ratios and attractive credit profiles as compared to the average home buyer 
at october   we had billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable us treasury securities on hand and approximately billion available under our revolving credit facility which extends to march during fiscal  we sold million principal amount of senior notes due and million principal amount of senior notes due we used a portion of the net proceeds from these sales to redeem or repurchase million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due and to conduct a tender offer for million principal amount of senior notes due in and in addition  in december  we redeemed the remaining million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due based on our experience during prior downturns in the housing industry  we believe that attractive land acquisition opportunities may arise in difficult times for those builders that have the financial strength to take advantage of them 
in the current challenging environment  we believe our strong balance sheet  our liquidity and access to capital  our broad geographic presence  our diversified product lines  our experienced personnel and our national brand name all position us well for such opportunities now and in the future 
we have begun to see reduced competition from the small and mid sized private builders who had been our primary competitors in the luxury market 
we believe that access by these private builders to capital is already severely constrained 
we envision that there will be fewer and more selective lenders serving our industry when the market rebounds and that those lenders likely will gravitate to the homebuilding companies that offer them the greatest security  the strongest balance sheets and the broadest array of potential business opportunities 
we believe that this reduced competition  combined with attractive long term demographics  will reward those well capitalized builders who can persevere through the current challenging environment 
notwithstanding the current market conditions  we believe that geographic and product diversification  access to lower cost capital  and strong demographics  have in the past and will in the future  as market conditions improve over time  benefit those builders that can control land and persevere through the increasingly difficult regulatory approval process 
we believe that these factors favor the large publicly traded home building companies with the capital and expertise to control home sites and gain market share 
we believe that  as builders and land developers reduce the number of home sites being taken through the approval process and this process continues to become more difficult  and if the political pressure from no growth proponents continues to increase  our expertise in taking land through the approval process and our already approved land positions will allow us to grow in the years to come  as market conditions improve 
because of the length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property  complete the land improvements on it  and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale  we are subject to many risks 
we attempt to reduce certain risks by controlling land for future development through options also referred to herein as land purchase contracts or option and purchase agreements whenever we can  thus allowing the necessary governmental approvals to be obtained before acquiring title to the land  generally commencing construction of a detached home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from the buyer  and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed price basis 
our risk reduction strategy of generally not commencing the construction of a home until we had an agreement of sale with a buyer was effective in the past  but due to the significant number of cancellations of agreements of sale that we have had during the current downturn in the housing market  many of which were for homes on which we had commenced construction  and the increase in the number of multi family communities that we have under construction  the number of homes under construction for which we do not have an agreement of sale has increased from our historical levels 
in response to current market conditions  we have been reevaluating and renegotiating or canceling many of our land purchase contracts 
in addition  we have sold  and may continue to sell  certain parcels of land that we have identified as non strategic 
as a result  we reduced our land position from a high of approximately  home sites at april   to approximately  home sites at october   of which we owned  of the  home sites owned at october   significant improvements were completed on approximately  at october   we were selling from communities  compared to communities at october  we expect to be selling from approximately communities at october  in addition  at october   we had communities that were temporarily closed due to market conditions and land controlled for an additional future communities 
given the current business climate and the numerous uncertainties related to sales paces  sales prices  mortgage markets  cancellations  market direction and the potential for and magnitude of future impairments  it is difficult to provide guidance 
subject to the risks reported elsewhere in this form k and our other sec filings and the preceding uncertainties  based upon our backlog at october   which was lower then our backlog at october   and the pace of activity at our communities  we currently estimate that we will deliver between  and  homes in fiscal at an average sales price between  and  per home 
we believe that  as a result of sales incentives given to our home buyers and slower delivery paces per community  our cost of sales as a percentage of revenues  before impairment charges and write downs  will be higher in fiscal than in fiscal additionally  based on lower projected revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to be lower in total dollars in fiscal than in fiscal  but higher as a percentage of revenues in fiscal than in fiscal contracts and backlog the aggregate value of gross sales contracts signed decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the value of gross sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  billion  homes in fiscal and billion  homes in fiscal the decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of a decrease in the number of gross contracts signed and a decrease in the average value of each contract signed 
the decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of a decrease in the number of gross contracts signed and a decrease in the average value of each contract signed 
in fiscal  home buyers cancelled million homes of signed contracts  as compared to million homes in fiscal and billion  homes in fiscal as a percentage of the number of gross contracts signed in fiscal  and  home buyers cancelled  and  respectively  and  and  respectively of the value of gross contracts signed 
in the last half of fiscal  we saw an improvement in our contract cancellation rate  in the fourth quarter and third quarter of fiscal  our contract cancellation rate the number of contracts cancelled in the period divided by the number of gross contracts signed in the period was and  respectively  as compared to and in the comparable periods of fiscal the aggregate value of net sales contracts signed decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the value of net sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  billion  homes in fiscal and billion  homes in fiscal the decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of a decrease in the number of net contracts signed and a decrease in the average value of each contract signed 
the decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of a decrease in the number of net contracts signed and a decrease in the average value of each contract signed 
we continue to believe that the decrease in the number of gross and net contracts signed and the increase in the cancellation rate of contracts above our historical rates is attributable to the continued slowdown that we have experienced since fiscal see overview above for an expanded discussion of the slowdown in our business 
the decrease in the average value of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to the higher average value of the contracts cancelled  higher sales incentives given to home buyers  and a shift in the number of contracts signed to less expensive areas and or products in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and in fiscal  as compared to fiscal at october   we were offering sales incentives  on average  of  or of the sales price of the home  as compared to  on average   or of the sales price of the home at october   and  or of the sales price of the home at october  the amount and type of incentive varies on a community by community basis and  in some cases  on a home site by home site basis within a community 
in addition  the amount of sales incentives offered to a home buyer on a speculative home that we have in our inventory will generally be higher than the amount of sales incentives that we will offer on a to be built home 
our backlog at october  of million  homes decreased  as compared to our backlog at october  of billion  homes 
backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers 
the decrease in backlog at october   as compared to the backlog at october   was primarily attributable to the continued decline in the new home market in fiscal  and the decrease in the value and number of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by lower deliveries in fiscal  as compared to fiscal at october   our backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  lower than our billion  homes backlog at october  the decrease in backlog at october   as compared to our backlog at october   was primarily attributable to a lower backlog at october   as compared to the backlog at october   and the decrease in the value and number of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by lower deliveries in fiscal  as compared to fiscal for more information regarding revenues  gross contracts signed  contract cancellations  net contracts signed and sales incentives provided on units delivered by geographic segment  see geographic segments in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or fair value  as determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition to direct land acquisition  land development and home construction costs  costs also include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead related to development and construction  which are capitalized to inventory during periods beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction 
for those communities that have been temporarily closed  no additional interest is allocated to the community s inventory until it re opens  and other carrying costs are expensed as incurred 
once a parcel of land has been approved for development and we open the community  it can typically take four or more years to fully develop  sell and deliver all the homes 
longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community and the sales and delivery pace of the homes in a community 
our master planned communities  consisting of several smaller communities  may take up to ten years or more to complete 
because of the downturn in our business  the estimated community lives will likely be significantly longer 
because our inventory is considered a long lived asset under gaap  we are required to regularly review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities for which we believe the values are not recoverable 
current communities when the profitability of a current community deteriorates  the sales pace declines significantly or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset  the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flow for the community to its carrying value 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flow is less than the community s carrying value  the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community 
the impairment is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the impairment is determined 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flow of a community  we use various estimates such as a the expected sales pace in a community  based upon general economic conditions that will have a short term or long term impact on the market in which the community is located and on competition within the market  including the number of home sites available and pricing and incentives being offered in other communities owned by us or by other builders  b the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community  c costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future  including  but not limited to  land and land development costs  home construction costs  interest costs and overhead costs  d alternative product offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace  sales price  building cost or the number of homes that can be built in a particular community  and e alternative uses for the property  such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites 
future communities we evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of current communities  whether owned or optioned  to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated 
this evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for current communities described above  as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals  the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain these approvals and the possible concessions that will be required to be given in order to obtain them 
concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets  dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built 
based upon this review  we decide a as to land under contract to be purchased  whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated  and b as to land we own  whether the land will likely be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner  or should be sold 
we then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off 
the write off is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the need for the write off is determined 
the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write offs related to current and future communities 
the table below provides  for the periods indicated  the number of operating communities that we tested for potential impairment  the number of operating communities in which we recognized impairment charges  the amount of impairment charges recognized  and  as of the end of the period indicated  the fair value of those communities  net of impairment charges amounts in millions 
impaired communities fair value of communities number of net of communities number of impairment impairment three months ended tested communities charges charges fiscal january april july october fiscal january april july october fiscal january april july october variable interest entities we have land purchase contracts and several investments in unconsolidated entities which we evaluate for consolidation in accordance with gaap 
in accordance with gaap  an enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected residual returns of a variable interest entity vie is considered to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
a vie is an entity with insufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors lack some of the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
for land purchase contracts with sellers meeting the definition of a vie  we perform a review to determine which party is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
this review requires substantial judgment and estimation 
these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the entity s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of the land under contract 
at october   we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of one vie related to a land purchase contract and had recorded million of inventory and million of accrued expenses related to this vie 
income taxes valuation allowance significant judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
in accordance with gaap  a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
we periodically assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on gaap s more likely than not realization threshold criteria 
in our assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration  and tax planning alternatives 
our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  on business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our actual tax results and our future business results may affect the amount of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods carryforward period assumptions  it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our historical analyses 
our assumptions require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
if our results of operations are less than projected and there is insufficient objectively positive verifiable evidence to support the likely realization of our deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be required to reduce or eliminate our deferred tax assets 
we recorded significant deferred tax assets in fiscal  and these deferred tax assets were generated primarily by inventory impairments and impairments of investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities 
in accordance with gaap  we assessed whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
we believe that the continued downturn in the housing market  the uncertainty as to its length and magnitude  and our continued recognition of impairment charges  are significant evidence of the need for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
at october   we had recorded valuation allowances against all of our net deferred tax assets 
we are allowed to carry forward tax losses for years and apply such tax losses to future taxable income to realize federal deferred tax assets 
in addition  we will be able to reverse previously recognized valuation allowances during any future period in which we report book income before taxes 
we will continue to review our deferred tax assets in accordance with gaap 
on november   the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of the act was enacted into law 
the act amended section of the internal revenue code to allow net operating losses realized in a tax year ending after december  and beginning before january  to be carried back for up to five years such losses were previously limited to a two year carryback 
we must select one tax year to which we may apply the extended carryback 
this change will allow us to carry back fiscal taxable losses to prior years and receive refunds of previously paid federal income taxes 
we have approximately billion of taxable income from fiscal and available for tax losses to be recognized in fiscal based on our projected taxable losses for fiscal  we anticipate that such refunds may be in excess of million and could be considerably higher 
the ultimate amount of such refunds realized is dependent on our actual taxable losses for fiscal  which may vary significantly from our current expectations 
we have not reflected the potential benefit of the extended carryback under the act in our october  consolidated financial statements 
for state tax purposes  due to past losses and projected future losses in certain jurisdictions where we do not have carryback potential and or cannot sufficiently forecast future taxable income  we recognized cumulative valuation allowances of million as of october  against our state deferred tax assets 
in the twelve month periods ended october  and  we recognized valuation allowances against our state deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
future valuation allowances in these jurisdictions may continue to be recognized if we believe we will not generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize future state deferred tax assets 
revenue and cost recognition the construction time of our homes is generally less than one year  although some homes may take more than one year to complete 
revenues and cost of revenues from these home sales are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer 
closing normally occurs shortly after construction is substantially completed 
in addition  we have several high rise mid rise projects that do not qualify for percentage of completion accounting in accordance with gaap  that are included in this category of revenues and costs 
during fiscal and  we completed construction on four projects for which we used the percentage of completion accounting method to recognize revenues and costs  the remaining units in these projects have been or will be accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting 
based upon the current accounting rules and interpretations  we do not believe that any of our current or future communities qualify for percentage of completion accounting 
for our standard attached and detached homes  land  land development and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
the estimated land  common area development and related costs of master planned communities  including the cost of golf courses  net of their estimated residual value  are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master planned community 
for high rise mid rise projects  land  land development  construction and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are generally amortized to the cost of units closed based upon an estimated relative sales value of the units closed to the total estimated sales value 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated total costs or revenues of the project are allocated to the remaining units to be delivered 
forfeited customer deposits are recognized in other income in the period in which we determine that the customer will not complete the purchase of the home and when we determine that we have the right to retain the deposit 
sales incentives in order to promote sales of our homes  we grant our home buyers sales incentives from time to time 
these incentives will vary by type of incentive and by amount on a community by community and home by home basis 
incentives that impact the value of the home or the sales price paid  such as special or additional options  are generally reflected as a reduction in sales revenues 
incentives that we pay to an outside party  such as paying some or all of a home buyer s closing costs  are recorded as an additional cost of revenues 
incentives are recognized at the time the home is delivered to the home buyer and we receive the sales proceeds 
off balance sheet arrangements the trends  uncertainties or other factors that have negatively impacted our business and the industry in general and which are discussed in the overview section of this md a have also impacted the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments 
we review each of our investments in unconsolidated entities on a quarterly basis to determine the recoverability of our investment 
we evaluate the recoverability of our investment in unconsolidated entities using similar methodology that we use to evaluate our inventories 
this evaluation entails a detailed cash flow analysis using many estimates including but not limited to expected sales pace  expected sales prices  expected incentives  costs incurred and anticipated  sufficiency of financing and capital  competition  and market conditions 
when markets deteriorate and it is no longer probable that we can recover our investment in a joint venture we impair our investment 
if a joint venture has its own loans or is principally a joint venture to hold an option  such impairment may result in the majority or all of our investment being impaired 
see critical accounting policies inventory in this md a for more detailed disclosure on our evaluation of inventory 
we have investments in and advances to various unconsolidated entities 
at october   we had investments in and advances to these entities  net of impairment charges recognized  of million  and were committed to invest or advance million net of amounts accrued of additional funds to certain of these entities if they require additional funding 
at october   we had accrued million for our commitments to all of our unconsolidated entities 
in addition  we guarantee certain debt of a number of these unconsolidated entities on a several and pro rata basis 
at october   we guaranteed an aggregate of approximately million net of amounts that we have accrued of debt relating to four joint ventures  which had aggregate borrowings of approximately million 
in connection with certain land joint ventures to which we are a party  we executed completion guarantees and conditional repayment guarantees 
the obligations under the completion guarantees and conditional repayment guarantees are several and not joint  and are limited to our pro rata share of the loan obligations of the respective joint ventures 
at october   the maximum amount of the completion guarantees and conditional repayment guarantees net of amounts that we have accrued is estimated to be approximately million  if any liability is determined to be due thereunder 
the million of these guarantees are included in the million of guarantees disclosed above 
our investments in these entities are accounted for using the equity method 
results of operations the following table compares certain statement of operations items related to fiscal  and amounts in millions revenues cost of revenues selling  general and administrative goodwill impairment loss from operations other loss from unconsolidated entities interest and other income expenses related to early retirement of debt loss income before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss income note amounts may not add due to rounding 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues and cost of revenues in fiscal  we recognized billion of revenues and a net loss of million  as compared to billion of revenues and a net loss of million in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized inventory and joint venture impairment charges and write offs of million  as compared to million of inventory and joint venture impairment charges and write offs in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we recognized million of valuation allowances against our federal and state deferred tax assets  as compared to million of valuation allowances against our state deferred tax assets in fiscal see critical accounting policies income taxes valuation allowance  above  for an expanded discussion relating to the valuation allowances recognized 
excluding million of revenues recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method in fiscal  revenues in fiscal were lower than those in fiscal by approximately billion  or 
this decrease was attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered and a decrease in the average price of the homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was primarily due to a decline in our backlog at october   as compared to our backlog at october   and a decrease in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to the impact of a shift in product mix to lower priced product and less expensive areas  and an increase in incentives given on homes closed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal average sales incentives given on homes delivered in fiscal amounted to approximately  per home or of the gross sales price of the home  as compared to approximately  per home  or of the gross sales price of the home  in fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal in fiscal and  we recognized inventory impairment charges and write offs of million and million  respectively 
cost of revenues  excluding inventory impairment charges and write offs collectively home costs  was of revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in the home costs percentage was due primarily to higher sales incentives on the homes delivered  higher interest costs and a change in the mix of product delivered 
sales incentives as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal  and in fiscal interest cost as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the higher interest cost percentage in fiscal was due to inventory generally being held for a longer period of time and fewer qualifying assets to which interest can be allocated  resulting in higher amounts of capitalized interest allocated to qualifying inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a spending decreased by million  or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the reduction in spending was due primarily to reduced compensation and related costs and reduced costs for advertising  promotions and marketing offset  in part  by the expensing of interest incurred not eligible to be capitalized in fiscal and the higher amount of deferred marketing costs that were written off with regard to communities that were temporarily closed  sold or redesigned in fiscal  as compared to fiscal due to the decline in qualified inventory  interest incurred on homebuilding indebtedness exceeded amounts eligible for capitalization in fiscal by million  which was expensed to sg a in fiscal prior to november   qualified inventory exceeded homebuilding indebtedness and all interest incurred was capitalized 
the write off of deferred marketing costs related to communities that were temporarily closed  sold or redesigned in fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
goodwill impairment during fiscal  due to the continued decline of the nevada and florida housing markets  we re evaluated the carrying value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of two small home builders in these markets 
we estimated the fair value of our assets in these markets  including goodwill 
fair value was determined based on the discounted future cash flow expected to be generated in these markets 
based upon this evaluation and our expectation that these markets would not recover for a number of years  we determined that the related goodwill had been impaired 
we recognized million of impairment charges in fiscal after recognizing these charges  we did not have any goodwill remaining on our balance sheet at october  loss from unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in the toll brothers realty trust trust and toll brothers realty trust ii trust ii 
we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from these entities 
the trends  uncertainties or other factors that have negatively impacted our business and the industry in general and that are discussed in the overview section of this md a have also impacted the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments 
many of our joint ventures are land development projects or high rise mid rise construction projects and do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property 
once development is complete  the joint ventures will generally  over a relatively short period of time  generate revenues and earnings until all the assets of the entity are sold 
because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities  the earnings recognized from these entities will vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in fiscal  we recognized million of losses from unconsolidated entities  as compared to million of losses in fiscal the loss in fiscal was attributable to million of impairment charges recognized on our investments in unconsolidated entities 
the loss in fiscal was attributable to million of impairment charges recognized on our investments in unconsolidated entities 
interest and other income interest and other income was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in other income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a million gain recognized in fiscal on a condemnation judgment in our favor  a million decline in interest income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  a million decline in retained customer deposits in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  a million decline in income from land sales in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and a million decline in income from ancillary businesses and management fee income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal expenses related to early retirement of debt in fiscal  we redeemed million principal amount of senior subordinated notes and conducted a tender offer for million principal amount of senior notes and incurred million of expenses related to the redemption and the tender offer  representing the call premium  the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and costs incurred to complete the tender offer 
loss before income taxes we reported a loss before income taxes of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
income taxes in fiscal  we recognized a provision for taxes of million and an income tax benefit of million in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  we recorded million and million  respectively  of valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets 
see critical accounting policies income taxes valuation allowance in this md a for information regarding the valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets 
excluding the valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets in fiscal and  we recognized a tax benefit in fiscal of million at an effective rate of and million at an effective rate of in fiscal the difference in the effective tax rates in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  excluding the deferred tax asset valuation allowances that we recognized  was primarily due to a the increased reversal in fiscal  over fiscal  of state tax provision net of federal tax provision accrued in prior years against potential tax assessments  which were no longer needed due to our settlement of various federal and state audits and the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for federal and state tax purposes  b a lower blended state tax rate in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to the combination of a shift in the state tax jurisdictions where the losses occurred and the applicable state income tax rates in those jurisdictions  c the recognition of additional tax provision in fiscal due to uncertainties of tax positions taken on prior year tax returns  d the reversal of tax credits recognized in prior years that will be lost due to the elimination of taxable income in those years due to the carryback of tax losses  and e an increase in the fiscal rates due to tax free income recognized in fiscal but not in fiscal we operate in states and are subject to various state tax jurisdictions 
we estimate our state tax liability based upon the individual taxing authorities regulations  estimates of income by taxing jurisdiction and the company s ability to utilize certain tax saving strategies 
due primarily to a change in our estimate of the allocation of income or loss  as the case may be  among the various state taxing jurisdictions and changes in tax regulations and their impact on our strategies  we estimated that our state income tax rate  net of a federal tax benefit  was for fiscal and for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues and cost of revenues revenues in fiscal were lower than those for fiscal by billion  or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered  a decrease in the average price of the homes delivered and a million decrease in percentage of completion revenues recognized 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered was primarily due to the lower backlog of homes at october   as compared to october  this lower backlog of homes was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal the decline in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to higher sales incentives given on homes closed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  which was offset by the settlement of units in several of our higher priced high rise projects not accounted for under the percentage of completion accounting method in fiscal that did not have settlements in fiscal  and a shift in product mix during fiscal to higher priced product 
sales incentives given on homes delivered in fiscal averaged  per home  as compared to  per home in fiscal the decline in percentage of completion revenues in fiscal was primarily the result of the delivery of available units for sale in projects accounted for using the percentage of completion method and the lack of new projects that qualify under the accounting rules for the application of the percentage of completion accounting method 
during fiscal and fiscal  we completed construction on four projects for which we used the percentage of completion accounting method to recognize revenues and costs  the remaining units in these projects have been or will be accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting 
based upon the current accounting rules and interpretations  we do not believe that any of our current or future communities qualify for the percentage of completion accounting method 
cost of revenues  including inventory impairment charges and write offs but excluding percentage of completion cost of revenues and interest of million  as a percentage of revenue excluding percentage of completion of revenues of million was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal in fiscal and  we recognized inventory impairment charges and write offs of million and million  respectively 
excluding inventory impairment charges and write offs  percentage of completion cost of revenues and interest  cost of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in the cost of revenues percentage before inventory impairment charges and write offs  percentage of completion cost of revenues and interest was due primarily to higher sales incentives on the homes delivered and higher overhead costs per home due to decreased construction activity  offset in part by the positive impact on cost of sales on homes settled in fiscal from communities that had reduced inventory values as a result of impairments previously recognized 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense varies depending on many factors  including the period of time that we owned the land  the length of time that the homes delivered during the period were under construction  and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by us in proportion to the amount of our inventory during those periods 
interest expense as a percentage of revenues was of total revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in interest expense as a percentage of revenues in fiscal was due to the added length of time that the homes delivered in fiscal remained in inventory and accumulated additional capitalized interest 
in addition  as our inventory has been reduced  there is less qualified inventory to which we allocate interest incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of revenues  sg a was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal sg a spending decreased by million  or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the reduction in spending was due primarily to reduced compensation costs and reduced costs for advertising  promotions and marketing 
goodwill impairment during fiscal  due to the continued decline of the nevada and florida housing markets  we re evaluated the carrying value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of two small home builders in these markets 
during fiscal  due to the continued decline of the detroit housing market  we re evaluated the carrying value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of a small home builder 
we estimated the fair value of our assets in these markets  including goodwill 
fair value was determined based on the discounted future cash flow expected to be generated in these markets 
based upon this evaluation and our expectation that these markets would not recover for a number of years  we determined that the related goodwill had been impaired 
we recognized million and million of impairment charges in fiscal and  respectively 
after recognizing these charges  we did not have any goodwill remaining on our balance sheet at october  losses from unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in the trust and trust ii 
we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from these entities 
many of our joint ventures are land development projects or high rise mid rise construction projects and do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property 
once development is complete  the joint ventures generally  over a relatively short period of time  are expected to generate revenues and earnings until all the assets of the entities are sold 
because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities  the operating results recognized from these entities will vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in fiscal  we recognized million of losses from unconsolidated entities  as compared to million of losses in fiscal the loss in fiscal was the result of million of impairment charges related to seven of our investments in unconsolidated entities 
the loss in fiscal was attributable to million of impairment charges related to two of our investments in unconsolidated entities 
interest and other income for fiscal and  interest and other income was million and million  respectively 
the increase in other income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the recognition in fiscal of a gain of million related to the receipt of proceeds from a condemnation judgment in our favor  and higher interest income  offset in part by million of gains from the sales of our cable tv and broadband internet businesses and our security monitoring business  higher retained customer deposits  higher income from ancillary businesses and higher management fees in fiscal loss income before income taxes for fiscal  we reported a loss before income tax benefits of million  as compared to million of income before income taxes for fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized an income tax benefit of million on a loss before income taxes of million 
in fiscal  we recognized a tax provision of million on income before taxes of million 
the primary differences in the effective tax rates in fiscal and fiscal were a the impact of state taxes on our effective tax rate  b higher accrued interest on anticipated tax assessments in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  c the benefit of tax credits available to us in fiscal  but not in fiscal  due to our reporting income in fiscal and a loss in fiscal  d greater non taxable earnings reported in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and e the impact of the recognition of a valuation allowance in fiscal against our state deferred tax assets 
we operate in states and are subject to various state tax jurisdictions 
we estimate our state tax liability based upon the individual taxing authorities regulations  estimates of income by taxing jurisdiction and the company s ability to utilize certain tax saving strategies 
due primarily to a change in our estimate of the allocation of income or loss  as the case may be  among the various state taxing jurisdictions and changes in tax regulations and their impact on our strategies  we estimated that our state income tax rate  net of a federal tax benefit  was for fiscal and for fiscal for state tax purposes  due to past and projected losses in certain jurisdictions where we do not have carryback potential and or cannot sufficiently forecast future taxable income  in fiscal  we recognized a valuation allowance of million million  net of federal tax benefit against our state deferred tax assets which decreased our fiscal effective tax rate by 
in fiscal  we did not recognize a valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets 
capital resources and liquidity funding for our business has been provided principally by cash flow from operating activities before inventory additions  unsecured bank borrowings and the public debt and equity markets 
prior to fiscal  we used our cash flow from operating activities before inventory additions  bank borrowings and the proceeds of public debt and equity offerings  to acquire additional land for new communities  fund additional expenditures for land development  fund construction costs needed to meet the requirements of our backlog  invest in unconsolidated entities  purchase our stock and repay debt 
at october   we had billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable us treasury securities on hand  an increase of million compared to october  in fiscal  cash flow provided by operating activities was million 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily generated by a reduction in inventory and the receipt of income tax refunds on previously paid taxes  offset  in part  by the payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and income tax payments made for the settlement of previously accrued tax audits 
the decreases in inventory  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were due primarily to the decline in our business as previously discussed 
we used million of cash in our investing activities in fiscal  primarily for investments in marketable us treasury securities and for investments made in our unconsolidated entities 
we also generated a net of million of cash from financing activities in fiscal  principally from the issuance of an aggregate of million principal amount of senior notes in the public debt markets net proceeds amounted to million  million of other borrowings primarily from our mortgage company warehouse loan  and our stock based benefit plans and the tax benefits of stock based compensation  offset  in part  by the redemption of  and tender for  an aggregate of million principal amount of senior and senior subordinated notes  million of expenses related to such redemption and tender offer  and the repayment of million of other borrowings  of which million was on our mortgage company warehouse loan 
in fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million to billion 
cash flow from operating activities was million 
cash flow from operating activities was generated primarily from income before inventory and investment impairment losses  reductions in inventory and a decrease in contracts receivable related to percentage of completion accounting  offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses excluding accruals of estimated liabilities to various joint ventures  a decrease in customer deposits and an increase in deferred tax assets 
the decreased inventory  contracts receivable  accounts payable and customer deposits were due primarily to the decline in our business as previously discussed 
we used million of cash flow in investing activities  primarily for additional investments in unconsolidated entities 
in addition  we used million of cash flow in financing activities  primarily for the repayment of debt  offset in part by cash generated from stock based benefit plans and the tax benefits of stock based compensation 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash  including million from operating activities and million from investing activities  offset in part by the use of million in financing activities 
in the fiscal period  net cash generated from operating activities was primarily attributable to income before write offs  offset in part by a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a reduction in customer deposits and an increase in deferred tax assets 
in general  our cash flow from operating activities assumes that  as each home is delivered  we will purchase a home site to replace it 
because we own several years supply of home sites  we do not need to buy home sites immediately to replace those which we deliver 
in addition  we generally do not begin construction of our single family detached homes until we have a signed contract with the home buyer  although in the past several years  due to the high cancellation rate of customer contracts and the increase in the number of attached home communities from which we were operating all of the units of which are generally not sold prior to the commencement of construction  the number of speculative homes in our inventory increased significantly 
should our business remain at its current level or decline  we believe that our inventory levels would continue to decrease as we complete and deliver the homes under construction but do not commence construction of as many new homes  as we complete the improvements on the land we already own and as we sell and deliver the speculative homes that are currently in inventory  resulting in additional cash flow from operations 
in addition  we might continue to delay or curtail our acquisition of additional land  as we have since the second half of fiscal  which would further reduce our inventory levels and cash needs 
at october   we owned or controlled through options approximately  home sites  as compared to approximately  at october    at october  and approximately  at april   the high point of our home sites owned and controlled 
of the  home sites owned or controlled through options at october   we owned  of our owned home sites  significant improvements were completed on approximately  at october   the aggregate purchase price of land parcels under option and purchase agreements was approximately million including million of land to be acquired from joint ventures in which we have invested 
of the million of land purchase commitments  we had paid or deposited million  we will receive a credit for prior investments in joint ventures of approximately million and  if we acquire all of these land parcels  we will be required to pay an additional million 
of the million we would be required to pay  we recorded million of this amount in accrued expenses at october  the purchases of these land parcels are scheduled over the next several years 
we have additional land parcels under option that have been excluded from the aforementioned aggregate purchase amounts since we do not believe that we will complete the purchase of these land parcels and no additional funds will be required from us to terminate these contracts 
during the past several years  we have had a significant amount of cash invested in either short term cash equivalents or short term interest bearing marketable securities 
in addition  we have made a number of investments in unconsolidated entities related to the acquisition and development of land for future home sites or in entities that are constructing or converting apartment buildings into luxury condominiums 
our investment activities related to marketable securities and to investments in and distributions of investments from unconsolidated entities are contained in the consolidated statements of cash flows under cash flow from investing activities 
we have a billion credit facility consisting of a billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility collectively  the credit facility with banks  which extends to march at october   we had no outstanding borrowings against the revolving credit facility but had letters of credit of approximately million outstanding under it 
under the terms of the credit facility  our maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement may not exceed to and at october   we were required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the credit agreement of approximately billion 
at october   our leverage ratio was approximately to and our tangible net worth was approximately billion 
in april  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due we received million of net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes 
in september  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due and we received million of net proceeds from the issuance 
in may  we redeemed million outstanding principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due and in june purchased an additional million principal amount of such notes through open market purchases 
in fiscal  we recognized a charge of million representing the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and the call premium on one of the series of notes 
in december  we redeemed the remaining million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due in october  we concluded a tender offer for million principal amount of our senior notes due and million principal amount of our senior notes due in fiscal  we recognized a charge of million representing the tender premium  the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and costs incurred to complete the tender offer 
in august  tbi mortgage company  our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary  entered into a master repurchase agreement with comerica bank  as agent and representative of itself as a buyer and the other buyers named therein 
the agreement replaced tbi mortgage company s warehouse credit facility which was set to expire 
the purpose of the agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by tbi mortgage company 
the agreement provides for loan purchases up to million  subject to certain sublimits 
in addition  the agreement provides for an accordion feature under which tbi mortgage company may request that the aggregate commitments under the agreement be increased to an amount up to million 
the agreement expires on july  we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources and our existing sources of credit 
due to the deterioration of the credit markets and the uncertainties that exist in the economy and for home builders in general  we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our estimated contractual payment obligations at october  amounts in millions thereafter total senior and senior subordinated notes a loans payable a mortgage company warehouse loan a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b retirement plans c other a amounts include estimated annual interest payments until maturity of the debt 
of the amounts indicated  billion of the senior and senior subordinated notes  million of loans payable and million of the mortgage company warehouse loan were recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
b amounts represent our expected acquisition of land under options or purchase agreements and the estimated remaining amount of the contractual obligation for land development agreements secured by letters of credit and surety bonds 
of the total amount indicated  million was recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
c amounts represent our obligations under our deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plans 
of the total amount indicated  million was recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land  land development  construction and overhead 
we generally contract for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes will affect our profits 
prior to the current downturn in the economy and the decline in demand for homes  the sales prices of our homes generally increased 
because the sales price of each of our homes is fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to purchase a home and because we generally contract to sell our homes before we begin construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
we generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
the slowdown in the homebuilding industry over the past several years and the decline in the sales prices of our homes  without a corresponding reduction in the costs  have had an adverse impact on our profitability 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes 
geographic segments we operate in four geographic segments around the united states the north  consisting of connecticut  illinois  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  new jersey  new york  and rhode island  the mid atlantic  consisting of delaware  maryland  pennsylvania  virginia and west virginia  the south  consisting of florida  georgia  north carolina  south carolina and texas  and the west  consisting of arizona  california  colorado and nevada
