item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations marketing marketing revenues  operating earnings and depreciation are as follows in thousands revenues crude oil natural gas refined products total operating earnings loss crude oil natural gas refined products total depreciation crude oil natural gas refined products total supplemental volume and price information is field level purchases per day crude oil  bbls  bbls  bbls natural gas  mmbtu  mmbtu  mmbtu average purchase price crude oil bbl bbl bbl natural gas mmbtu mmbtu mmbtu reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the oil and natural gas field level and pipeline pooling points 
comparison to crude oil revenues increased by percent in the current year due to significantly increased commodity prices during major portions of the year 
the company s monthly average crude oil acquisition price rose from the per barrel level at year end to the per barrel level in june with a subsequent steep decline beginning in august to the per barrel range by year end 
the effect of fluctuating prices was to cause inventory liquidation gains during the first half of as prices increased  with inventory liquidation and valuation losses occurring during the second half of as the market price declined 
net inventory driven losses for were million 
in contrast  rising prices produced million of inventory liquidation gains in the company s inventory holdings result from shipments in transit and as of december   the company held  barrels of inventory valued at an average price of per barrel 
excluding the impact of inventory values as described above  crude oil operating earnings for and would have been  and  respectively 
absent the inventory items  crude oil earnings from operations were reduced in as a result of escalated prices for the diesel fuel consumed in the trucking function of this business 
diesel fuel expense was million in compared to million for natural gas sales are reported net of underlying natural gas purchase costs and thus reflect margins before operating costs 
as shown above  such margins were reduced in relative to as the marketplace did not provide a normal level of opportunities to enhance margins by meeting short term day to day demand needs 
such conditions existed  in part from weather patterns not stimulating localized demand spikes 
excluding temporary volume reductions caused by third quarter hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico  the company continues to add purchase volumes while still attempting to enhance per unit margins 
refined products revenues increased during consistent with increased commodity prices partially offset by reduced volumes as the company reduced its sales activity to less credit worthy accounts 
refined product driven operating earnings were reduced during because of an increased allowance for doubtful accounts receivable through a bad debt charge of  the company has a number of construction industry customers that experienced significantly increased fuel costs coupled with a downturn in the housing development market 
with an elevated likelihood of this class of customer experiencing financial insolvency  the company s bad debt provision was increased accordingly 
historically  prices received for crude oil  natural gas and refined products have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue 
see also discussion under item commodity price risk 
comparison to crude oil revenues increased during relative to due to higher commodity prices as reflected above 
crude oil operating earnings improved in relative to because of the million in inventory liquidation gains coupled with improved end market pricing received from the company s customers relative to crude oil acquisition costs 
the year also benefited from a  reduction in operating expenses from the reversal of certain previously recorded accrual items following a negotiated settlement of disputed amounts 
during  crude oil prices fluctuated from periods of increasing prices to periods of decreasing prices with little affect on full year results 
natural gas operating earnings were reduced in relative to due to increased transportation and salary costs 
refined product revenues were reduced in despite increased commodity prices for gasoline and diesel fuel 
motor fuel sales volumes for were reduced due to a heightened competitive marketplace and weather related reductions in construction demand 
coupled with escalating fuel and wage costs  the competitive picture in produced an operating loss for the company s refined products business 
transportation the transportation segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings depreciation represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
comparison to transportation revenues include various component parts  the most significant being standard line haul charges  fuel adjustment charges and demurrage 
line haul revenues declined slightly during to million versus million in as demand for the company s services generally remained consistent 
fuel adjustment billings increased to million in compared to million in for comparative additional revenue of million 
however  actual fuel expense incurred increased by million during to million 
the partial inability to fully pass along fuel increases coupled with increased salary and wage cost during reduced operating earnings for the year 
based on the current level of infrastructure  the company s transportation segment is designed to maximize efficiency when revenues excluding fuel adjustments are in the million per year range 
demand for the company s trucking service is closely tied to the domestic petrochemical industry that has experienced general weakness in recent months 
the company s transportation business tends to contract when united states and world economies weaken and is further hindered by a current relatively strong exchange value for the us dollar 
other important factors include levels of competition within the tank truck industry as well as competition from the railroads 
comparison to demand for the company s liquid chemical truck hauling business was generally sound during  especially as it relates to agricultural chemical product movements 
a slight overall improvement in demand led to increased revenues and operating earnings 
oil and gas oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily derived from crude oil and natural gas production volumes and prices 
comparative amounts for revenues  operating earnings and depreciation and depletion were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings loss depreciation and depletion producing property impairments represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
comparative volumes and prices were as follows production volumes crude oil  bbls  bbls  bbls natural gas  mcf  mcf  mcf average price crude oil bbl bbl bbl natural gas mcf mcf mcf improved current year oil and gas segment revenues resulted from increased overall average commodity prices for both crude oil and natural gas as shown above 
crude oil volumes are reduced in and as a result of normal production declines while natural gas volumes increased with favorable drilling results for although oil and gas revenues improved during  the operating loss sustained also increased for the current year due to higher charges for depreciation and depletion  producing property impairments and exploration expense 
at year end  world crude oil prices fell to the per barrel range 
as a result  the company s year end oil and gas reserves evaluation were based on average crude oil prices of per barrel and average natural gas prices of per mcf as compared to average prices of per barrel and per mcf utilized for the evaluation 
reduced prices act to suppress estimated oil and natural gas reserve quantities which in turn increase the rate of depreciation and depletion and producing property impairment valuations 
additionally  operating earnings were burdened in and when exploration expenses were incurred as follows in thousands dry hole expense prospect abandonment seismic and geological total during  the company participated in the drilling of wells with successful and dry holes

the company s current drilling and exploration efforts are primarily focused as follows eaglewood project the eaglewood project area encompasses a ten county area from south texas along the gulf coast and northward into east texas 
in this area  the company purchased existing d seismic data and reprocessed it using proprietary techniques 
during five wells were successfully drilled and future drilling is anticipated as costs and prices dictate 
the focus for will be on identifying economically viable prospects for future drilling 
the company has a five percent working interest in this project 
east texas project beginning in  the company and its partners began acquiring acreage in east texas and currently hold an interest in approximately  acres in nacogdoches and shelby counties 
seven marginally successful wells were drilled in this area during and in  the working interest owners elected to replace the operator as results were not meeting expectations 
subsequently  five productive wells were drilled and future drilling awaits evaluation of the success of the program 
based on the outcome of recent efforts  as many as twelve additional wells could be drilled 
the company has a five percent working interest in this project 
southwestern arkansas the company is participating in three d seismic surveys in southwestern arkansas covering approximately square miles 
two dry holes were drilled in the first survey both of which will be sidetracked as analysis indicates the objective zone was not penetrated 
the first well in the second survey will spud in the first quarter of and the third survey is complete with data being processed 
early indications point to multiple drillable prospects being identified 
the company s working interest in this project varies from percent to percent 
south central kansas the company is participating with a ten percent working interest in a large d seismic survey in south central kansas 
data acquisition on this survey will begin in the first quarter of assumption parish  louisiana the company participated in a proprietary d seismic survey in assumption parish  louisiana during eight prospects have been identified with two initial wells scheduled for drilling in the first quarter of future drilling is contingent on the results of the first two wells and the company holds a six percent working interest in this project 
irion county  texas in the company participated with a percent working interest in the acquisition of approximately  gross acres to develop the wolfcamp formation 
four wells were spudded in with two wells on production and two wells completing 
further drilling activity is deferred pending price stabilization and completion of well performance evaluation 
oil and gas property sale in may  the company sold its interest in certain louisiana producing oil and gas properties 
sale proceeds totaled million resulting in a pre tax gain on sale of approximately million 
general and administrative  interest income and income tax general and administrative expenses were elevated during due primarily to federally mandated sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
interest income increased in and due to larger cash balances available during the year for overnight investment coupled with interest earned on insurance related cash deposits 
interest income declined in as interest rates on overnight deposits declined to near zero 
the provision for income taxes is based on federal and state tax rates and variations are consistent with taxable income in the respective accounting periods 
outlook recent disruptions in the credit markets  declining crude oil prices and deteriorating financial conditions among some of the company s customers has adversely affected results of operations 
in response  the company has scaled back its capital budget and tightened customer credit requirements 
importantly  the company has no bank debt outstanding and is in a position to fund and sustain its operations through existing available cash flow 
given current economic conditions  planned activities for are reduced and the company has the following major objectives for establish marketing operating earnings at the million level 
maintain transportation operating earnings at the million level 
establish oil and gas operating earnings at the million level and replace percent of production with current reserve additions 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity primarily derives from net cash provided from operating activities  which was   and  for each of  and  respectively 
changes in cash provided by operations for these periods were primarily driven by changes in working capital and such changes generally reflect timing differences that occur in the ordinary course of business and are not expected to have a significant impact on overall liquidity 
as of december  and  the company had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  as of december   and such balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day to day cash needs 
working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  totaled  as of december  management believes current cash balances  together with expected cash generated from future operations  will be sufficient to meet short term and long term liquidity needs 
the company utilizes cash from operations to make discretionary investments in its oil and natural gas exploration  marketing and transportation businesses  which comprise substantially all of the company s investing cash outflows for each of the past three years 
the company does not look to proceeds from property sales to fund its cash flow needs 
however  during may  the company did receive net proceeds of  related to the sale of oil and gas properties 
such sale was made due to attractive pricing 
currently  the company does not plan to make significant dispositions of its oil and gas properties in the future  but certain oil and gas interests may be disposed of should favorable opportunities arise 
except for a total of million in operating lease commitments for transportation equipment and office lease space  the company s future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows contract 
capital expenditures during included  for marketing and transportation equipment additions and  in property additions associated with oil and gas exploration and production activities 
included in marketing equipment additions was approximately million expended to acquire used truck tractor combinations for use in the company s crude oil marketing business in michigan  west texas and new mexico 
for  the company anticipates expending approximately million on oil and gas exploration projects to be funded from operating cash flow and available working capital 
in addition  approximately million will be expended toward replacement of older truck tractors within the company s marketing and transportation businesses with funding from available cash flow 
historically  the company pays an annual dividend in the fourth quarter of each year  and the company paid a 
per common share or  dividend to shareholders of record as of december  the most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations and such earnings are dependent on the success of future operations see item a risk factors in this annual report of form k 
while the company has available bank lines of credit see below management has no current intention to utilize such lines of credit or issue additional equity 
banking relationships the company s primary bank loan agreement with bank of america provides for two separate lines of credit with interest at the bank s prime rate minus of one percent 
the working capital loan provides for borrowings based on percent of eligible accounts receivable and percent of eligible inventories 
available capacity under the line is calculated monthly and as of december  the company elected to establish the line at million 
the oil and gas production loan provides for flexible borrowings subject to a borrowing base requested by the company and approved semi annually by the bank 
the borrowing base was established at million as of december  the working capital facilities are subject to a of one percent commitment fee 
the line of credit loans are scheduled to expire on october   with the then present balance outstanding converting to a term loan payable in eight equal quarterly installments 
as of december  and  there was no bank debt outstanding under the company s two revolving credit facilities 
the bank of america loan agreement  among other things  places certain restrictions with respect to additional borrowings and the purchase or sale of assets  as well as requiring the company to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining a to ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities  maintaining a to ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense  and consolidated net worth in excess of  should the company s net worth fall below this threshold  the company may be restricted from payment of additional cash dividends on its common stock 
due to the pre tax loss sustained during  the company obtained a waiver of the interest coverage ratio as of december  and otherwise  the company is in compliance with these restrictions 
previously  the company s gulfmark and arm subsidiaries maintained a separate banking relationship with bnp paribas in order to provide letters of credit to support its crude oil and natural gas purchasing activities 
due to rate increases imposed by the bank  effective february   the company discontinued this facility 
previously  letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately million as of december  from time to time the company may utilize available cash balances to pre pay for crude oil and natural gas supply in lieu of providing a letter of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements the company maintains certain operating lease arrangements primarily with independent truck owner operators in order to provide truck tractor equipment for the company s fleet 
any commitments with independent truck owner operators are on a month to month basis 
all operating lease commitments qualify for off balance sheet treatment as provided by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
rental expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
as of december   commitments under long term non cancelable operating leases for the next five years are payable as follows      and none thereafter 
contractual cash obligations in addition to its banking relationships and obligations  the company enters into certain operating leasing arrangements for tractors  trailers  office space and other equipment and facilities 
the company has no capital lease obligations 
a summary of the payment periods for contractual debt and lease obligations is as follows in thousands thereafter total long term debt lease payments total in addition to its lease financing obligations  the company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil and natural gas in connection with its marketing activities 
such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales  which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations 
approximate commodity purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands january remaining thereafter total crude oil natural gas insurance from time to time  the marketplace for all forms of insurance enters into periods of severe cost increases 
in the past  during such cyclical periods  the company has seen costs escalate to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable 
the company s primary insurance needs are in the areas of worker s compensation  automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for employees 
during each of  and  insurance cost stabilized and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
overall insurance cost may experience renewed rate increases during since the company is generally unable to pass on such cost increases  any increase will need to be absorbed by existing operations 
competition in all phases of its operations  the company encounters strong competition from a number of entities 
many of these competitors possess financial resources substantially in excess of those of the company 
the company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit  pricing of available materials and quality of service 
in its oil and gas operation  the company also competes for the acquisition of mineral properties 
the company s marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities 
these major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the company 
from time to time in recent years  there have been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace 
this in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas 
as a result  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates fair value accounting the company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related accounting pronouncements 
such contracts are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for  and the company elects  cash flow hedge accounting 
the company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting under sfas no 
consistent with sfas no 
 fair value measurements the company utilizes a market approach to valuing its contracts 
on a contract by contract  forward month by forward month basis  the company obtains observable market data for valuing its contracts 
such contracts typically have durations that are less than months 
as of december   all of the company s measurements were defined as either level or level inputs by sfas no 
 representing quoted prices and inputs based on observable market data  respectively 
see discussion under fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s fair value contracts give rise to market risk  which represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of a particular commitment 
the company monitors and manages its exposure to market risk to ensure compliance with the company s risk management policies 
such policies are regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given management s objectives  strategies and current market conditions 
trade accounts accounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the most significant assets and liabilities of the company 
particularly within the company s energy marketing  oil and gas exploration  and production operations  there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties including transaction counterparties to provide adequate information for the proper recording of amounts receivable or payable 
substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the company with the source documents for recording trade activity 
it is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents 
this typically requires the company to absorb  benefit from  or pass along such corrections to another third party 
due to the volume of and complexity of transactions and the high degree of interdependence with third parties  this is a difficult area to control and manage 
the company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties 
ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances 
the company also places great emphasis on collecting cash balances due and paying only bonafide and properly supported claims 
in addition  the company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance 
nevertheless a degree of risk remains due to the custom and practices of the industry 
oil and gas reserve estimate the value of capitalized cost of oil and natural gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and natural gas reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors 
the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data  production performance data and reservoir engineering data  changing prices  as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data 
the process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision of estimates usually on an annual basis as additional information becomes available 
calculations of estimated future oil and natural gas revenues are also based on estimates of the timing of oil and natural gas production  and there are no assurances that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates 
also  certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing 
the company s estimates assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer s estimates  except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts 
there can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions  governmental regulation  political conditions  economic conditions  weather conditions  market uncertainty and other factors impact the market price for oil and natural gas 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  so only costs including development dry hole costs associated with producing oil and natural gas wells are capitalized 
estimated oil and natural gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the company s units of production method for depreciating  depleting and amortizing of oil and natural gas properties 
estimated oil and natural gas reserve values also provide the standard for the company s periodic review of oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
contingencies from time to time as incident to its operations  the company becomes involved in various accidents  lawsuits and or disputes 
primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet  the company is a party to motor vehicle accidents  worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry 
in addition  the company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws  environmental laws and labor laws  among others 
should an incident occur  management evaluates the claim based on its nature  the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage 
to the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the company  management will estimate the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
revenue recognition the company s crude oil  natural gas and refined products marketing customers are invoiced daily or monthly based on contractually agreed upon terms 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer 
where required  the company also recognizes fair value or mark to market gains and losses related to its commodity activities 
a detailed discussion of the company s revenue recognition policy is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
transportation segment customers are invoiced  and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
oil and natural gas revenue from the company s interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and natural gas passes to the purchaser 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
provides an entity with the option to measure certain assets and liabilities and other items at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
the provisions of sfas no 
do not affect the fair value measurements of derivative financial instruments under sfas no 
the provisions of sfas no 
became effective january  management did not elect the fair value option for any eligible financial assets or liabilities not already carried at fair value 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 fsp fas no 

this staff position amends sfas no 
to delay the effective date of sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after november   except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the company is currently assessing the impact of applying fsp fas no 
to its financial and non financial assets and liabilities 
future financial statements are expected to include enhanced disclosures with respect to fair value measurements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 
as amended and interpreted 
sfas no 
changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  early adoption is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on its financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting to revise the existing regulation s k and regulation s x reporting requirements to align with current industry practices and technological advances 
the new disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require a company to a disclose its internal control over reserves estimation and report the independence and qualification of its reserves preparer or auditor  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserve audit and c report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than period end prices 
the disclosures required by this final ruling will become effective for the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk includes potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company s long term debt facility provides for interest costs to fluctuate based on interest rate changes 
since the company s long term debt is a floating rate  the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying value 
more importantly  the company had no long term debt outstanding at december  and a hypothetical percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended december commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its marketing and production of crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing spot prices applicable to oil and gas 
commodity price risk in the company s marketing operations represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of an asset or a commitment 
from time to time  the company enters into forward contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on its purchases of crude oil and natural gas 
the company may also enter into price support contracts with certain customers to secure a floor price on the purchase of certain supply 
in each instance  the company locks in a separate matching price support contract with a third party in order to minimize the risk of these financial instruments 
substantially all forward contracts fall within a six month to one year term with no contracts extending longer than three years in duration 
certain forward contracts are recorded at fair value  depending on management s assessments of numerous accounting standards and positions that comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
the fair value of such contracts is reflected on the balance sheet as fair value assets and liabilities and any revaluation is recognized on a net basis in the company s results of operations 
see discussion under fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas sales have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue 
from january  through december  natural gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of mmbtu to a monthly high of per mmbtu 
oil prices ranged from a monthly average low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during the same period 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in average natural gas and crude oil prices  assuming no changes in volume levels  would have reduced earnings by approximately  and  for the comparative years ended december  and  respectively
