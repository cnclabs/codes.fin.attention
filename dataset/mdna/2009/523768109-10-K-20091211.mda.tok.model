item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and item a  interest rates  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with the company s financing arrangements 
economic conditions according to the national bureau of economic research  the united states economy entered a recession in the three months ended december and it is widely believed that certain elements of the economy  such as housing  were in decline before that time 
and revenue  operating results and cash flows were significantly impacted by the recession 
united states gross domestic product increased in the three months ended september  potentially signaling the end of the current recession 
the duration and depth of an economic recession in markets in which the company operates may further reduce its future advertising and circulation revenue  operating results and cash flows 
operating revenue a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from advertising 
the demand for advertising is sensitive to the overall level of economic activity  both nationally and locally 
operating revenue in most categories decreased in and and may decrease in the future 
such decreases may not be offset by growth in advertising in other categories  such as online revenue which  until  had been rising significantly 
there can also be no assurance such online growth will resume 
historically  newspaper publishing has been viewed as a cost effective method of delivering various forms of advertising 
there can be no guarantee that this historical perception will guide future decisions on the part of advertisers 
to the extent that advertisers shift advertising expenditures to other media outlets  including those on the internet  the profitability of the company s business may continue to be impacted 
the rates the company charges for advertising are  in part  related to the size of the audience of its publications and websites 
there is significant competition for readers and viewers from other media 
the company s business may be adversely affected to the extent individuals decide to obtain news  entertainment  classified listings and local shopping information from internet based or other media  to the exclusion of the company s outlets for such information 
retail advertising many advertisers  including major retail store chains  automobile manufacturers and dealers  banks and telecommunications companies  have experienced significant merger and acquisition activity over the last several years  and some have gone out of business  effectively reducing the number of brand names under which the merged entities operate 
the company s retail revenue is also being impacted by the current economic environment 
for example  a decline in the housing market negatively impacts retail advertising related to home improvement  furniture and home electronics 
classified advertising classified advertising is the category that has been most significantly impacted by the current economic environment 
in  as the recession accelerated  employment classified advertising  including both print and online  declined as unemployment increased 
this trend continued in 
table of contents in  and  real estate classified advertising also suffered declines due primarily to cyclical issues  such as declining sale prices and an increase in unsold homes  affecting the residential real estate market nationally 
in this decline accelerated due to the access to  and limitations on  residential mortgage funding 
automotive classified advertising revenue declined in  and  due to industry wide issues affecting certain domestic auto manufacturers and the overall decline in economic conditions leading to the current recession 
see item  advertising  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with advertising revenue 
circulation though the company s overall audience is growing  and its circulation unit results have outperformed the industry  circulation unit sales have nonetheless been declining fractionally for several years 
the possibility exists that future circulation price increases may be delayed or reduced as a result of future declines in circulation unit sales  and that price decreases may be necessary to retain or grow circulation unit volume 
the company is reaching increasingly larger audiences through stable newspaper readership and rapid online audience growth 
nonetheless  declines in circulation unit sales could also adversely impact advertising revenue 
see item  audiences  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with circulation revenue 
operating expenses the company reduced operating expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization  impairment charges and other unusual costs  by  or  in  by  or in and expects to reduce such operating expenses by an additional in such expense reductions are not expected to significantly impact the company s ability to deliver advertising and content to its customers 
the results of future labor negotiations could affect the company s operating results 
for additional information concerning the company s labor relations  see item  employees  included herein 
newsprint comprises a significant amount of the company s operating costs 
see item  newsprint and item a  commodities included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with changes in newsprint costs 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company has significant amounts of goodwill and identified intangible assets 
in and  the company recorded substantial impairment charges to reduce the value of certain of these assets 
should general economic  market or business conditions continue to decline  and have a negative impact on the company s stock price or cash flows  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future 
see item  critical accounting policies  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with such assets 
equity capital as of december   the company s common stock traded at an average day closing market price of less than per share 
under the nyse listing standards  if the company s common stock fails to maintain an adequate per share price and total market capitalization  the company s common stock could be removed from the nyse and traded in the over the counter market 
in december  the nyse notified the company that it did not meet the nyse continued listing standard due to its failure to maintain an adequate share price 
subsequent to that date  the nyse temporarily suspended the standard through july  and extended lee s six month cure period until december in 
table of contents september  the nyse notified lee that its average share price had risen sufficiently to cure the share price deficiency 
as of november   the company s common stock traded at an average day closing market price of per share and its equity market capitalization totaled approximately  all of these factors  along with volatile equity market conditions  could limit the company s ability to raise new equity capital in the future

item legal proceedings the company is involved in a variety of legal actions that arise in the normal course of business 
insurance coverage mitigates potential loss for certain of these matters 
while the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions  it is the opinion of management that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  taken as a whole 
in  a group of newspaper carriers filed suit against the company in the united states district court for the southern district of california  claiming to be employees and not independent contractors of the company 
the plaintiffs seek relief related to violation of various employment based statutes  and request punitive damages and attorneys fees 
the suit is in the discovery stage and an initial decision by the judge regarding class certification is expected in at this time the company is unable to predict whether the ultimate economic outcome  if any  could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  taken as a whole 
the company denies the allegations of employee status  consistent with past practices of the company and the industry  and intends to vigorously contest the action  which is not covered by insurance

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to the company s results of operations and financial condition as of  and for each of the three years ended  september this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included herein 
non gaap financial measures no non gaap financial measure should be considered as a substitute for any related financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  the company believes the use of non gaap financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information with which to evaluate its financial performance  or assist in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
the company also believes such non gaap financial measures are alternative indicators of performance used by investors  lenders  rating agencies and financial analysts to estimate the value of a publishing business or its ability to meet debt service requirements 
operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow  which is defined as operating income before depreciation  amortization  impairment of goodwill and other assets and equity in earnings of associated companies  and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow divided by operating revenue represent non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below 
the company believes these measures provide meaningful supplemental information because of their focus on results from operations excluding such non cash factors 
reconciliations of operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin to operating income loss and operating income loss margin  the most directly comparable measures under gaap  are included in the table below thousands percent of revenue percent of revenue percent of revenue operating cash flow less depreciation and amortization less impairment of goodwill and other assets  nm  nm plus equity in earnings of associated companies less reduction in investment in tni  nm  nm operating income loss  nm  nm  
table of contents adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share  which are defined as income loss available to common stockholders and earnings loss per common share adjusted to exclude unusual matters and those of a substantially non recurring nature  are non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below 
the company believes these measures provide meaningful supplemental information by identifying matters that are not indicative of core business operating results or are of a substantially non recurring nature 
reconciliations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings loss per common share to income loss available to common stockholders and earnings loss per common share  respectively  the most directly comparable measures under gaap  are set forth below under the caption overall results 
same property comparisons certain information below  as noted  is presented on a same property basis  which is exclusive of acquisitions and divestitures consummated in the current or prior year 
the company believes such comparisons provide meaningful supplemental information for an understanding of changes in its revenue and operating expenses 
same property comparisons exclude tni and mni 
the company owns of tni and also owns of the capital stock of mni  both of which are reported using the equity method of accounting 
same property comparisons also exclude corporate office costs 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information follows with regard to certain of the most critical of the company s accounting policies 
goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of its goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets  the company makes a determination of the fair value of its business 
fair value is determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future revenue  expenses and cash flows discounted to their present value  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the publishing industry 
an impairment charge will generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of the business exceeds its estimated fair value 
the required valuation methodology and underlying financial information that are used to determine fair value require significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
the company analyzes its goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein  for a more detailed explanation of the company s intangible assets 
such indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  changes in business climate and operating or cash flow losses related to such assets 
due primarily to the continuing  and at the time increasing difference between its stock price and the per share carrying value of its net assets  the company analyzed the carrying value of its net assets as of 
table of contents december  and again as of march  deterioration in the company s revenue and the overall recessionary operating environment for the company and other publishing companies were also factors in the timing of the analyses 
as a result  in the company recorded pretax  non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill by  the company also recorded pretax  non cash charges of  and  to reduce the carrying value of nonamortized and amortizable intangible assets  respectively 
 of additional pretax charges were recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the company s investment in tni 
the company also recorded additional  pretax non cash charges of  to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
the company recorded  of income tax benefit related to these charges 
for similar reasons  in the company recorded pretax  non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill by  the company also recorded pretax  non cash charges of  and  to reduce the carrying value of nonamortized and amortizable intangible assets  respectively 
 of additional pretax charges were recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the company s investment in tni 
the company also recorded additional  pretax non cash charges of  to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
the company recorded  of income tax benefit related to these charges 
the company reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
the company assesses recoverability of these assets by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or asset group with their carrying amount 
the impairment amount  if any  is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
the company also periodically evaluates its determination of the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets 
any resulting changes in the useful lives of such intangible assets will not impact the cash flows of the company 
however  a decrease in the useful lives of such intangible assets would increase future amortization expense and decrease future reported operating results and earnings per common share 
based on substantial impairment charges recorded in both and  and the most recent testing performed  at september   the company does not believe its reporting unit is at risk of failing future goodwill impairment testing 
however  future decreases in the company s market value  or significant differences in revenue  expenses or cash flows from estimates used to determine market value  could affect this determination 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans the company evaluates its liability for pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans based upon computations made by consulting actuaries  incorporating estimates and actuarial assumptions of future plan service costs  future interest costs on projected benefit obligations  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  expected investment returns on plan assets  asset allocation assumptions of plan assets  and other factors 
if the company used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly  resulting in recognition of different amounts of expense over future periods 
increases in market interest rates  which may impact plan assumptions  generally result in lower service costs for current employees  higher interest expense and lower liabilities 
actual returns on plan assets that are lower than the plan assumptions will generally result in decreases in a plan s funded status and may necessitate additional contributions 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method  whereby deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
table of contents adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
recent changes in accounting for uncertain tax positions can result in additional variability in the company s effective income tax rate 
the company files income tax returns with the internal revenue service irs and various state tax jurisdictions 
from time to time  the company is subject to routine audits by those agencies  and those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
the company has considered the alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various taxing agencies  believes its positions taken regarding its filings are valid  and that adequate tax liabilities have been recorded to resolve such matters 
however  the actual outcome cannot be determined with certainty and the difference could be material  either positively or negatively  to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss in the periods in which such matters are ultimately determined 
the company does not believe the final resolution of such matters will be material to its consolidated financial position or cash flows 
revenue recognition advertising revenue is recorded when advertisements are placed in the publication or on the related online site 
circulation revenue is recorded as newspapers are distributed over the subscription term 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
unearned revenue arises in the ordinary course of business from advance subscription payments for publications or advance payments for advertising 
uninsured risks the company is self insured for health care  workers compensation and certain long term disability costs of its employees  subject to stop loss insurance  which limits exposure to large claims 
the company accrues its estimated health care costs in the period in which such costs are incurred  including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims 
other risks are insured and carry deductible losses of varying amounts 
the company s accrued reserves for health care and workers compensation claims are based upon estimates of the remaining liability for retained losses made by consulting actuaries 
the amount of workers compensation reserve has been determined based upon historical patterns of incurred and paid loss development factors from the insurance industry 
an increasing frequency of large claims  deterioration in overall claim experience or changes in federal or state laws affecting the company s liability for such claims could increase the volatility of expenses for such self insured risks 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles asc  which became the source of accounting principles to be applied in the preparation of financial statements for nongovernmental agencies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to certain of these market risks is managed as described below 
interest rates restricted cash and investments interest rate risk in the company s restricted cash and investments is managed by investing only in short term securities 
only us government and related securities are permitted 
debt the company s debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company s primary exposure is to libor 
a basis point increase or decrease to libor would  in theory  decrease or increase respectively  income from continuing operations before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately  based on  of floating rate debt outstanding at september   after consideration of the interest rate swaps discussed below  and excluding debt subject to interest rate collars discussed below and debt of mni 
the company s debt under the credit agreement is subject to minimum interest rate levels of  and for borrowings for one month  three month and six month periods  respectively 
at september   all of the company s outstanding debt under the credit agreement is based on one month borrowing 
based on the difference between interest rates at the end of november and the company s minimum rate for one month borrowing  day libor would need to increase approximately basis points before the company s borrowing cost would begin to be impacted by an increase in interest rates 
at september   the company had outstanding interest rate swaps in the notional amount of  the interest rate swaps had original terms of four or five years  carried interest rates from 
table of contents to plus the applicable libor margin and effectively fixed the company s interest rate on debt in the amount  and for the time periods  of such instruments 
in  the company executed interest rate collars in the notional amount of  the collars had a two year term and limited libor to an average floor of and a cap of 
such collars effectively limited the range of the company s exposure to interest rates to libor greater than the floor and less than the cap in either case plus the applicable libor margin for the time period of such instruments 
at september   after consideration of the interest rate swaps described above  approximately of the principal amount of the company s debt was subject to floating interest rates 
the interest rate collars described above limited the company s exposure to interest rates on an additional of the principal amount of its debt 
as of november   the full amount of the outstanding balance under the credit agreement became subject to floating interest rates  as all interest rate swaps and collars expired or were terminated at or prior to that date 
certain of the company s interest earning assets  including those in employee benefit plans  also function as a natural hedge against fluctuations in interest rates on debt 
commodities certain materials used by the company are exposed to commodity price changes 
the company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non cancelable supply contracts 
the company is a participant in a buying cooperative with other publishing companies  primarily for acquisition of newsprint 
the company is also involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through identification of sourcing and operating efficiencies 
primary commodity price exposures are newsprint and  to a lesser extent  ink and energy costs 
significant declines in north american newsprint demand led to an approximate price decline between december and august declines in newsprint demand were driven by the recessionary pressures on print advertising as well as noteworthy newsprint conservation programs  particularly web width size reductions  initiated in the demand decline outpaced the north american newsprint suppliers ability to reduce newsprint production  which led to excess inventories at both the producer and publisher levels 
most newsprint producers reported late summer transaction selling prices to be below cash operating costs 
this operating loss position  along with the move of the largest north american newsprint producer abitibibowater inc  to seek financial reorganization  has sparked several consecutive monthly price increase announcements  beginning in september  certain of which have since been delayed or rescinded 
some north american newsprint producers have removed production capacity on a permanent basis in addition to idling excess capacity on an indefinite  but temporary basis  in an effort to balance capacity with current demand trends and support the announced price increases and their return to a positive cash flow position 
the final extent of changes in price  if any  is subject to negotiation between newsprint producers and the company 
a per tonne price increase for pound newsprint would result in an annualized reduction in income before income taxes of approximately  based on anticipated consumption in  excluding consumption of mni and tni and the impact of lifo accounting 
such prices may also decrease 
the company substantially increased its supply of newsprint in  which may help to mitigate the impact of recently announce price increases 
sensitivity to changes in value the company s fixed rate debt consists of the pulitzer notes  which are not traded on an active market and held by a small group of noteholders 
coupled with the volatility of substantially all domestic credit markets that exists the company is unable  as of september   to measure the maximum potential impact on fair value of fixed rate debt of the company from adverse changes in market interest rates under normal market conditions 
the change in value  if determined  would likely be significant 
changes in the value of interest rate swaps and interest rate collars from movements in interest rates are not determinable  due to the number of variables involved in the pricing of such instruments 
however  increases in interest rates would generally result in increases in the fair value of such instruments
