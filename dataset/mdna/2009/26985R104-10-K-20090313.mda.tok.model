the selected historical financial data as of and for the year ended december  and as of and for the eleven month period ended november  are derived from the audited financial statements of eagle rock predecessor and as of and for the years ended december   and are derived from the audited financial statements of eagle rock pipeline  lp the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended december    and are derived from the audited financial statements of eagle rock energy partners  lp the following table includes the non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus or minus income tax provision benefit  interest net  including realized interest rate risk management instruments and other expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  impairment expense  other operating expense  non recurring  other non cash operating and general and administrative expenses  including non cash compensation related to our equity based compensation program  unrealized gains losses on commodity and interest rate risk management related instruments  and other income expense 
adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by external users of eagle rock s financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and research analysts 
adjusted ebitda is useful in determining our ability to sustain or increase distributions 
by excluding unrealized derivative gains losses  a non cash  mark to market benefit charge which represents the change in fair market value of our executed derivative instruments and is independent of our assets performance or cash flow generating ability  we believe adjusted ebitda reflects more accurately our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our level of indebtedness  make cash distributions to our unitholders and general partner and finance our maintenance capital expenditures 
we further believe that adjusted ebitda  by excluding unrealized derivative gains losses  also describes more accurately the underlying performance of our operating assets by isolating the performance of our operating assets from the impact of an unrealized  non cash measure designed to describe the fluctuating inherent value of a financial asset 
similarly  by excluding the impact of non recurring discontinued operations  adjusted ebitda provides users of our financial statements a more accurate picture of our current assets cash generation ability  independently from that of assets which are no longer a part of our operations 
eagle rock s adjusted ebitda definition may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures of other entities  as other entities may not calculate adjusted ebitda in the same manner as eagle rock 
for example  we include in adjusted ebitda the actual settlement revenue created from our commodity hedges by virtue of transactions undertaken by us to reset commodity hedges to higher prices or purchase put or other similar floors despite the fact that we exclude from adjusted ebitda any charge for amortization of the cost of such commodity hedge reset transactions or puts 
for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  please read summary non gaap financial measures

see part ii item selection financial data non gaap financial measures for reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net cash flows from operating activities and net income loss 

table of contents non gaap financial measures we include in this filing the following non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda as defined on page 
we provide reconciliations of this non gaap financial measure to its most directly comparable financial measures as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes or depreciation and amortization expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate net income 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is important to consider both net income determined under gaap  as well as adjusted ebitda  to evaluate our liquidity 
our adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and operating income and these measures may vary among companies 
therefore  our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
for example  we include in adjusted ebitda the actual settlement revenue created from our commodity hedges by virtue of transactions undertaken by us to reset commodity hedges to higher prices or purchase puts or other similar floors despite the fact that we exclude from adjusted ebitda any charge for amortization of the cost of such commodity hedge reset transactions or puts
