table of contents of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share and three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of per share each 
dividends paid during fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
applied currently anticipates that it will continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the future  although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied s financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  business conditions and other factors  as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of applied s stockholders

applied expects that changes in its business will affect its working capital components  primarily related to its energy and environmental solutions segment  which includes products for manufacturing solar pvs 
applied has entered into contracts with multiple customers for its sunfab thin film line for projects of varying scale

factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost basis  the financial condition  credit quality and near term prospects of the investee  and whether it is more likely than not that applied will be required to sell the security prior to any anticipated recovery in fair value 
generally  the contractual terms of the investments do not permit settlement at prices less than the amortized cost of the investments 
while applied cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity  applied believes that its 
table of contents investment policies provide an appropriate means to manage the risks in its investment portfolio 
the following types of financial instruments may present additional risks arising from liquidity and or credit concerns structured investment vehicles  auction rate securities  sub prime and alt a mortgage backed securities  and collateralized debt obligations

off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by applied or its subsidiaries 
as of october   the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was million 
applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
applied does not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements 
applied also has operating leases for various facilities 
total rental expense for operating leases was million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal 
table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes applied s contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt obligations interest expense associated with long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities represents applied s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied s a outstanding purchase orders for goods and services  and b contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods 
in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above  the company has certain tax obligations 
gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of october   the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million  exclusive of interest and penalties 
increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were million as of october  and million as of october  all million in interest and penalties is classified as long term payable in the consolidated balance sheets 
at this time  the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and  accordingly  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
as discussed above  on november   applied entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of semitool  a public company based in the state of montana  for per share in an all cash tender offer 
under the terms of the agreement approved by the boards of directors of both companies  applied will pay an aggregate purchase price of approximately million based on the fully diluted capitalization of semitool

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates applied could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and 
table of contents reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as applied s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that applied s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of applied s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product  current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 
applied s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates  material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as applied s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on historical experience  credit evaluations  specific customer collection history and any customer specific issues applied has identified 
changes in circumstances  such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends  may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value 
the fair value of a 
table of contents reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital 
management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment  especially in new emerging markets 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required 
if actual results differ from these estimates  applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied s expectations could have a material impact on applied s results of operations and financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at october   applied s investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately billion 
applied s primary objective for investing in fixed income securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
based on applied s investment portfolio at october   an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately million 
while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio  applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the investment is determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
all of applied s debt bears interest at fixed rates 
therefore  an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies  such as japanese yen  euro  israeli shekel and swiss francs 
applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within months 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen  euro  israeli shekel and swiss francs  and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions 
applied s outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged  therefore  the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying 
table of contents transactions 
the effect of an immediate percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
applied s risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option 
premiums paid for options outstanding at october  were not material
