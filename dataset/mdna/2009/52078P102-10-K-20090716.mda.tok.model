intellectual property and product liability we regard certain aspects of our internal operations  software and documentation as proprietary  and rely on a combination of contract  copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws and other measures  including confidentiality agreements  to protect our proprietary information 
we currently hold three patents in the us existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
we believe that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry  trade secret and copyright protection is less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent software product enhancements  and the timeliness and quality of support services 
we cannot guarantee that these protections will be adequate  or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
historically  we have provided our customers source code for many of our products 
we may elect to distribute only object code in the future 
in either case  we will permit customers to obtain access to our other source code through a source code escrow arrangement 
access to our source code may increase the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of our intellectual property 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our software products are  or may be licensed  do not protect our software products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and sweden 
we do not believe our software products  third party software products we offer under sublicense agreements  our trademarks  or other lawson proprietary rights infringe the property rights of third parties 
however  we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future software products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
as described in this report under item  legal proceedings  we are currently defending a patent lawsuit brought by eplus  inc against us and three other companies 
under the license agreements with our customers  we agree to indemnify our customers for third party claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of those third parties 

table of contents we are also exposed to product liability risks under applicable country and state laws 
we generally attempt to limit our exposure to product liability claims with customers as part of our license agreements 
however  local laws or unfavorable judicial decisions might diminish or invalidate the scope of these limitations

risk factors factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous uncertainties and risks 
investors evaluating our company and our business should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report on form k 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition and or negatively affect our stock price 
additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may make forward looking statements from time to time  both written and oral 
we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements based on circumstances or events which occur in the future 
the actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
the current global economic recession has negatively impacted our contracting activity and revenue  required that we reduce our expenses and imposed risks on our business 
some prospective and existing customers have cancelled  delayed or downsized software purchases and implementation projects because of the adverse economy and their internal budget constraints 
some customers may also experience difficulty in paying us for previously purchased products and services 
the adverse economic environment has also intensified the difficulty of forecasting software license and services revenue due  in part  to the lengthening and uncertainty of the sales cycle 
a decrease in licensing activity will typically lead to a decrease in services revenue in the same or subsequent quarters 
lower licensing activity will also lower new maintenance revenue since maintenance fees for new product licenses are based on the amount of associated license fees 
we took steps in fiscal to reduce headcount and lower expenses 
despite our efforts to focus on new sales of products and services and to manage our expenses  there is risk that we will not be able to achieve our business plan during this difficult global economic environment 
economic  political and market conditions  can adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results 
the uncertainty posed by the long term effects of the global economic recession  the global credit crisis  escalating energy prices  terrorist activities  potential pandemics  natural disasters and related uncertainties and risks and other geopolitical issues may impact the purchasing decisions of current or potential customers 
because of these factors  we believe the level of demand for our products and services  and projections of future revenue and operating results  will continue to be difficult to predict 
these geopolitical risks could also impede employee travel and our business operations in any affected regions 
we face large  established competitors  specialized competitors and substantial price competition 
we compete with oracle corporation  sap ag  microsoft corporation  and other larger software companies that have advantages over us due to their larger customer bases  greater name recognition  long operating and product development history  greater international presence and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
if customers or prospects want to reduce the number of their software vendors  they may elect to purchase competing products from oracle  sap  or microsoft since those larger vendors offer a wider range of products 
furthermore  oracle is capable of bundling its software with its database applications  which underlie a significant portion of our installed 
table of contents applications 
we also compete with a variety of more specialized software and services vendors  including single industry software vendors  human resource management software vendors  financial management software vendors  manufacturing software vendors  merchandising software vendors  services automation software vendors  software integrators and outsourced services providers  and internet on demand software vendors 
we believe that oracle  sap and other competitors are discounting their products and services on an increasing basis to attempt to gain market share in the markets where we compete 
some competitors also offer payment terms  contractual warranties  implementation terms or guarantees that are more favorable to customers and prospects 
competitors may entice our customers and prospects to switch software vendors by offering those customers or prospects free or heavily discounted products or services  and other more favorable contract terms 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existing competitors without lowering prices or offering other favorable terms to customers that lower our margins and increase our risks 
we expect competition to persist and intensify  which could negatively impact our operating results and market share 
we may have exposure to potential impairment charges related to our goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we have made several acquisitions over the past few years  primarily the acquisition of intentia in april as a result of these acquisitions  we have recorded on our balance sheet approximately million of goodwill and million of intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  as of may  we may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or our acquired intangible assets if we determine that the fair value of the goodwill and or our acquired intangible assets is less than their current carrying value 
in general  this could occur if our market capitalization  adjusted for control premiums and other factors  declines to an amount below the carrying value of our consolidated net assets  or if we do not anticipate that the acquired intangibles will generate future cash flows in line with our expectations as established at the date of acquisition 
in addition  we have announced plans to reorganize our operations around our targeted vertical markets 
as a consequence  we may be required to change our reportable operating segments  which would require us to change how we test for potential goodwill impairment 
recording an impairment charge related to our goodwill or acquired intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets  in notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
our revenues  and in particular our software license revenues  vary each quarter and are difficult to predict 
revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our licensing activity with new and existing customers  and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter under our revenue recognition policies 
a significant portion of our future revenue is dependent upon our existing installed base of customers continuing to license additional products  as well as purchasing consulting services and renewing their annual maintenance agreements 
if we do not continue to develop or acquire new products  licensing activity with existing customers will decline 
licensing activity for our products drives maintenance and services revenues because we sell maintenance and services for only 
table of contents our products 
a decrease in licensing activity will typically lead to a decrease in services revenue in the same or subsequent quarters 
if we do not have sufficient new licensing activity each year  our maintenance revenue for the following year will decline because new customers or sales of additional products to existing customers are needed to offset the percentage of existing customers who scale back their businesses  reduce licenses and maintenance contracts  are acquired  or otherwise choose not to renew annual maintenance 
our sales force and marketing team must continue to generate sales leads among existing customers and prospective customers 
when we qualify a lead  that lead becomes part of our sales pipeline 
if our pipeline does not continue to grow in our different markets and geographies  our revenues will eventually decline 
the rate at which we convert our pipeline into actual sales can vary greatly from year to year for the following reasons the period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may vary and can be more than one year 
during the sales cycle  prospective customers may decide not to purchase or may scale down purchases because of competing offers  budgetary constraints or changes in the prospect s management  strategy  business or industry 
increasingly  customer or prospect organizations are taking more steps to approve the purchase of our products and services 
often times  we must wait for a customer or prospect s board of directors to approve a purchase 
these added approval requirements can delay the sales cycle and jeopardize the likelihood of completing the sale 
a substantial number of our existing and prospective customers make their purchase decision within the last few weeks or days of each quarter 
a delay or deferral in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause our quarterly license revenue to fall significantly short of our predictions 
prospective customers may decline or defer the purchase of new products if we do not have sufficient customer references for those products 
new products or technologies  software industry mergers and other software industry news may create uncertainty and cause customers and prospective customers to cancel  postpone or reduce capital spending for our products 
because a substantial portion of our software license revenue contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter  and our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term  unexpected revenue shortfalls and deferrals have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability 
we may not retain or attract customers if we do not develop new products and enhance our current products in response to technological changes and competing products 
the enterprise software market is faced with rapid technological change  evolving standards in computer hardware  software development  communications and security infrastructure  and changing needs and expectations of customers 
building new products and service offerings requires significant investment in development 
a substantial portion of our research and development resources are devoted to regulatory and maintenance requirements and product upgrades that address new technology support 
these demands put significant constraints on our resources available for new product development 
we also face uncertainty when we develop or acquire new products because there is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop for those products 
we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments  and any acquisitions and investments we do complete may create business difficulties or dilute earnings 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates 
even if we identify suitable candidates  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to make acquisitions or investments on 
table of contents commercially acceptable terms 
if we acquire a company  we may incur losses in the operations of that company and we may have difficulty integrating its products  personnel and or operations into our business 
in addition  its key personnel may decide not to work for us 
these difficulties could disrupt our on going business  distract our management and workforce  increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 
we may also incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business 
furthermore  we may incur significant debt or issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments 
the issuance of equity securities may be dilutive to our stockholders 
if the products of an acquired company are not successful  those remaining assets could become impaired  which may result in an impairment loss that could materially adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
competitors may take advantage of our limited intellectual property protection 
we consider certain aspects of our internal operations  software and documentation to be proprietary  and rely on a combination of contract  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect this information 
in addition  we currently hold three patents in the u 
s 
copyright laws afford only limited protection because those laws do not protect product ideas 
in addition  when we license our products to customers  we provide source code for many of our products 
customers may also access source code through a source code escrow arrangement 
access to our source code could provide an opportunity for companies to offer competing maintenance and product modification services to our customers 
defending our intellectual property rights is time consuming and costly 
others may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
many participants in the technology industry have an increasing number of patents and have frequently demonstrated a readiness to take legal action based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement 
these types of claims are time consuming and costly to defend 
as described in this report under item  legal proceedings  we are currently defending a patent infringement lawsuit brought by eplus  inc against us and three other companies 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
deterioration in our relationships with resellers  systems integrators and other third parties that market and sell our products could reduce our revenues 
our revenue growth will depend  in part  on adding new partners to expand our sales channels  as well as leveraging our relationships with existing partners 
if our relationships with these resellers  system integrators and strategic and technology partners deteriorate or terminate  we may lose sales and marketing opportunities 
some current and potential customers rely on third party systems integrators to implement and manage new and existing applications 
these systems integrators may increase their promotion of competing enterprise software applications  or may otherwise discontinue their relationships with us 
because we do not own all of the products that we license  we rely on our continued relationships with other software suppliers 
we license third party software products that we incorporate into  or resell with  our own software products 
for example  we incorporate in many of our products software supplied by micro focus international  inc and streamserve  inc 
we also have reseller and alliance relationships with ibm  business software incorporated and other software suppliers businesses that allow us to resell their offerings with our products and services 
these relationships and other technology licenses are subject to periodic renewal and may include minimum sales requirements 
a failure to renew or early termination of these relationships or other technology licenses could adversely impact our business 

table of contents international sales and operations subject us to risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues  and have significant operations  outside of the us our international operations include software development  sales  customer support and administration 
we face challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries  which can entail longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  overlapping tax regimes  difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
we must comply with a variety of international laws and regulations  including trade restrictions  local labor ordinances  and import and export requirements 
we may experience foreign currency gains and losses 
we conduct a significant portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
our revenues and operating results are affected when the us dollar strengthens or weakens relative to other currencies 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies  particularly the swedish krona and euro as well as the british pound and norwegian krona relative to the us dollar can significantly affect our revenues and operating results 
recognized balance sheet exposures are partially offset by forward currency contracts that we purchase 
net foreign currency transaction gains and losses  resulting primarily from recognized balance sheet exposures  are recorded within earnings in the period incurred 
litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business and industry throughout the world 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and the risk of litigation by employees  customers  suppliers  stockholders or others through private actions  class actions  administrative proceedings or other litigation 
litigation can be lengthy  expensive  and disruptive to our operations and results cannot be predicted with certainty 
there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation  regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 
as a result  litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products are deployed in large and complex systems and may contain defects or security flaws or be implemented incorrectly 
because our products are deployed in large and complex systems  they can only be fully tested for reliability when deployed in networks for long periods of time 
our software programs may contain undetected defects when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our customers might encounter difficulties with the implementation of our products  discover defects in our products  experience corruption of their data or encounter performance or scaling problems only after our software programs have been deployed 
the services needed for implementing our products are also complex  and require knowledge and cooperation between both the customer s and the service provider s teams 
as a consequence  from time to time we have received customer complaints or been sued 
in addition  our products are combined with products from other vendors 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
software and data security are becoming increasingly important because of regulatory restrictions on data privacy and the significant legal exposures and business disruptions stemming from computer viruses and other unauthorized entry or use of computer systems 
we may not be able to avoid or limit liability for disputes relating to product performance  software security or the provision of services 
product defects and security flaws could expose us to product liability and warranty claims and harm our reputation  which could impact our future sales of products and services 

table of contents open source software may diminish our license fees and impair the ownership of our products 
the open source community is comprised of many different formal and informal groups of companies  software developers and individuals who have created a wide variety of software and have made that software available for use  distribution and modification  often free of charge 
open source software  such as the linux operating system  has been gaining in popularity among business users 
if developers contribute enterprise application software to the open source community  and that software has competitive features and scale to business users in our markets  we will need to change our product pricing and distribution strategy to compete 
if one of our developers embedded open source components into one of our products  without our knowledge or authorization  our ownership and licensing of that product could be in jeopardy 
depending on the open source license terms  the use of an open source component could mean that all products delivered with that open source component become part of the open source community 
in that case  we would not own those delivered products and could not charge license fees for those products 
we currently take steps to train our developers and monitor the content of products in development  but there is no assurance that these steps will always be effective 
business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results 
a significant portion of our critical business operations  including research and development  product maintenance  services support  and general and administrative support  are concentrated in a few geographic areas 
a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing maintenance and services to customers 
a major earthquake  fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our profit margin for consulting services is lower than margins related to the other aspects of our business 
the consulting part of our business is highly competitive  is less proprietary  and carries a much lower gross margin than the other aspects of our business 
our consulting services business is highly sensitive to customer demands  competitive pressures and other external and internal forces 
our actions to improve our consulting services margin may be offset by these forces which could negatively impact our operating results 
we must attract and retain account executives in our sales organization to achieve our revenue goals 
revenue growth  and in particular software license revenue growth  requires that we have a sufficient number of trained account executives in our sales organization to develop leads and call on prospective customers 
competition in our industry for experienced account executives is intense 
competitors and other software companies may lure away our account executives through signing bonuses and other special incentives 
the failure to attract and retain account executives will negatively impact our revenue growth 
when we hire a new account executive  the time period required for that person to become productive will vary  depending on their experience and training and the customer pipeline and length of sales cycle 
if we are unable to attract and retain senior management  software developers  services consultants  finance and accounting specialists  and other qualified personnel  we will be unable to develop new products and increase our revenue and profitability 
we also rely on the continued service of our senior management  software developers  services consultants  finance and accounting specialists  and other key employees 
in the software industry  there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business  product development  technical  
table of contents financial and other personnel 
the failure to attract  train  retain and effectively manage employees could negatively impact our development and efforts and cause a degradation of our customer service 
if we are unable to attract and retain finance and accounting personnel who have experience with the software industry and u 
s 
accounting requirements  we will have to rely on more costly contractors to fill the roles necessary for us to meet our governance and regulatory requirements 
we are required to delay revenue recognition into future periods for portions of our license fee activity 
our entire worldwide business is subject to united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
under those rules  we are required to defer revenue recognition for license fees in situations that include the following the customer agreement includes products that are under development or has other undelivered elements  the customer agreement includes essential services  including significant modifications  customization or complex interfaces this is more prevalent with our m products  the customer agreement includes acceptance criteria  the customer agreement includes extended or contingent payment terms or fees  a third party vendor  whose technology is incorporated into our products  delays delivery of its product to the customer  the customer agreement includes a fixed fee service arrangement for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  or we are not able to establish historical pricing and maintenance renewal rates to meet the vsoe requirements of these accounting rules 
we expect that we will continue to defer recognition of portions of our license fee activity in each period because of these factors  with deferrals more likely for a our m products because of product customization often required due to the nature of the manufacturing and distribution industries that is frequently included with new sales  b sales to governmental entities because those often include fixed fee arrangements for which we do not have vsoe of fair value  and c sales of large license fee contracts because it is more difficult to use standard contract terms 
the amount of license fees deferred may be significant and will vary each quarter  depending on the mix of products sold in each market and geography  and the actual contract terms 
we may take additional restructuring actions that result in financial charges in the period taken 
in fiscal  we took actions to reduce costs in response to the current global economic downturn and as part of our preparation for verticalization of our organization s structure in fiscal depending on the continued impact of the global recession and the uncertainty of any recovery  we may decide to take additional restructuring actions to improve our operational efficiencies and we may be required to incur financial charges in the period when we make such decisions  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 
we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 
as a multinational organization  we are subject to income taxes as well as non income based taxes  in both the us as well as in various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  there is no 
table of contents assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we are also subject to non income taxes  such as payroll  sales  use  value added  net worth  property and goods and services taxes  both in the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non income taxes and may have additional exposure to additional non income tax liabilities 
our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate  which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 
our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates  changing tax laws  regulations  and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes  unanticipated changes in tax rates  changes in accounting and tax treatment of stock based compensation  the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods  changes to the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets  or the assessments  or any related tax interest or penalties  could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place 
we report our results of operations based on our determinations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
periodically  we receive notices that a tax authority to which we are subject has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority  and we regularly engage in discussions  and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities 
we are engaged in disputes of this nature from time to time 
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded  our operating results  cash flows  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of lawson or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  our stockholder rights plan and delaware law could make it more difficult for other businesses to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions  among others  which may inhibit an acquisition of our company by a third party advance notification procedures for matters to be brought before stockholder meetings  a limitation on who may call stockholder meetings  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  and the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without a stockholder vote 
the issuance of stock under our stockholder rights plan could delay  deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder  meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder unless various conditions are met  such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors 
any of these restrictions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 

table of contents control by existing shareholders could significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of may   our executive officers  directors  and affiliated entities  in the aggregate  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
from time to time  hedge fund investors have accumulated large positions in our stock 
groups of stockholders  if acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
sale of a portion of these shares in the public market  or the perception that such sales are likely to occur  could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
our stock price could become more volatile and our stockholders investments could lose value 
all of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price 
the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products  product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us  and any announcements by us of acquisitions  major transactions  or management changes could also affect our stock price 
our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock and market trends unrelated to our performance 
a significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business

our enterprise software solutions focus on providing competitive advantages and business flexibility to our customers 
lawson s solutions fall within three main product lines and include related maintenance and consulting services 
our product lines are referred to as lawson s enterprise management system  lawson m enterprise management system  and lawson strategic human capital management with many of the solutions in each product line having broad  cross industry application 
our s solutions consist of business applications designed for services oriented industries 
our m solutions consist of applications that are geared for manufacturing  distribution and trade businesses who face resource constraints and whose processes are often complex and industry specific 
our strategic human capital management applications provide solutions for customers to strategically manage their workforce 
during fiscal and prior years  we operated as one business segment  the development and marketing of computer software and related services including consulting  maintenance and customer support 
in fiscal  we will be reorganizing our operations to provide greater focus on and better serve our targeted vertical markets 
with this strategic workforce realignment  we will be reviewing our organizational structure and internal financial reporting to determine if a change in our reportable operating segments will be warranted in fiscal any change to our reportable segments will be reflected in the applicable interim periods of fiscal the financial market crisis disrupted credit and equity markets worldwide and lead to a weakened global economic environment during fiscal the affect of the weakened global economy and the fallout from the financial market crisis has been a challenge for our license contracting and demand for our services in fiscal beginning in the second quarter of fiscal some prospective and existing customers began canceling  delaying or downsizing software purchases and implementation projects because of the adverse economy and their internal budget constraints 
our customers budget constraints continued through the second half of fiscal in anticipation of the lengthening sales cycle and in response to this challenging economic environment  we have taken actions during fiscal to reduce our headcount  including sales and service positions and lower expenses and may consider possible future actions to reduce our operating costs if circumstances warrant 
the adverse economic environment has also intensified the difficulty of forecasting software license and consulting 
table of contents services revenues 
a decrease in licensing activity will typically lead to a decrease in services revenues in subsequent quarters 
lower licensing activity will also lower new maintenance revenues since maintenance fees for new product licenses are based on the amount of associated license fees 
revenues for fiscal were million  down compared to million in fiscal the continued global economic downturn has significantly affected software and information technology spending and as a result has negatively impacted our revenues 
in addition  the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also had a significant negative impact on our fiscal revenues as discussed below 
revenues in all our geographic regions were down for fiscal compared to fiscal our emea region experienced the largest decrease of approximately while our apac and americas regions were down and less than  respectively 
maintenance revenues were up in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was more than offset by a decrease in fiscal consulting revenues as compared to fiscal in addition  fiscal license fees revenues decreased compared to the similar periods last year primarily relating to a decrease in m sales in our emea region 
the americas accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal while our emea region accounted for of total revenues 
the remaining originated in apac 
total gross margin as a percent of revenues for fiscal improved to compared to in fiscal this improvement in total gross margin as a percent of revenues was primarily due to a higher mix of maintenance revenues to total revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal we experienced improved margins on our maintenance revenues which were partially offset by significantly lower consulting margins as well as a slight decrease in margins on our license fees revenues 
operating expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percent of revenues  operating expenses for fiscal increased to compared to last year 
our results for fiscal include restructuring charges of approximately million relating to the cost reduction actions we announced on november  and may  in response to the continued uncertainty in the global economic environment  we implemented a restructuring plan over the second and third quarter of fiscal that included the elimination of approximately employees  or of our global workforce  and the closing of two of our leased facilities 
in addition  on may   we began a realignment of our organizational structure to provide greater focus on our targeted vertical markets 
this restructuring of our work force included the elimination of an additional employees  or of our global workforce and consolidation of space in certain of our overseas leased facilities 
see note  restructuring  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for more information 
in addition  we have reduced our discretionary spending while preserving targeted investments that we believe will enable lawson s long term growth and increase our operational efficiencies 
a significant portion of our business is in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the swedish krona sek and the euro 
our revenues and operating expenses are affected by fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates 
since our acquisition of intentia in april  the us dollar has generally weakened against the sek and euro 
however  during fiscal  mainly the second quarter  foreign currency exchange rates were extremely volatile and the us dollar strengthened significantly against most major currencies 
the us dollar exchange rates improved relative to the sek during fiscal while the us dollar to euro exchange rates increased by 
these fluctuations in the exchange rates affected our fiscal results as improvements in the us dollar to sek and euro exchange rates have the effect of reducing our revenues but also reducing our operating expenses denominated in currencies other the us dollar 
for financial results denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  we calculate constant currency changes by converting the prior period financial results at the exchange rates applicable to current periods 
we believe these constant currency changes provide additional insight into our business performance during the applicable reporting periods exclusive of the effects of foreign currency 
table of contents exchange rate fluctuations  and should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for the actual changes in revenues  expenses  income or other financial measures presented in this annual report on form k 
the strengthening of the us dollar during fiscal had a negative impact on our revenues of approximately million  or  of the decline in revenues  as compared to fiscal this primarily affected our emea region resulting in a negative impact on license fees  maintenance and consulting revenues of  and  respectively  as compared to last year 
excluding the effect of currency fluctuations  our total revenues were down approximately million  or  as compared to the fiscal together  these resulted in a total decrease in revenues during fiscal of million as compared to the similar period last year 
the currency fluctuations also had the effect of decreasing our total costs and operating expenses  as reported in us dollars  by approximately million  which is in addition to a decrease in total expenses of million excluding the effect of currency fluctuations resulting in a total reported decrease of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on our fiscal net income of approximately per share 
acquisitions we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values at the effective date of the acquisitions and the results of operations have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition dates 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill recorded as a result of these acquisitions is subject to an annual impairment test and is not amortized 
these acquisitions are intended to enhance our focus on targeted vertical markets and to provide additional value added products and services to our customers 
see note  business combinations  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information related to our recent acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented  as well as our disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  fair value of investments  fair value of stock based compensation  fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment  income taxes  restructuring obligations and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and assumptions on our historical experience and on various other information available to us at the time that these estimates and assumptions are made 
we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies and reflect those areas that require more significant judgments  and use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue recognition rules for software businesses are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded 
however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from year to year 
the significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectability can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
in addition  our transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements  which typically include license fees  maintenance and support fees and consulting service fees 
these multiple element arrangements must be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the aicpa  and in accordance with the sec accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide related consulting services  including training  and implementation services  as well as on going customer support and maintenance 
when our consulting  training and implementation services are not considered essential to the functionality of our software products  are sold separately and also are available from a number of third party service providers  our revenues from these services are generally recorded separately from license fees and recognized as the services are performed 
license fees within software arrangements including services that do not meet any one or a combination of the three criteria listed above  are recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  using contract accounting and the percentage of completion methodology based on labor hours input 
software arrangements which include certain fixed fee service components are usually recognized as the services are performed while corresponding costs to provide these services are expensed as incurred 
from time to time  we enter into software arrangements that include software license  maintenance  and consulting services which are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
in these instances  we recognize revenue for the three revenue streams under two units of accounting  which are the i software license bundled together with consulting services and ii maintenance 
for purposes of displaying revenues  we present applicable license fees  maintenance and consulting revenues in our consolidated statements of operations using vsoe or  if unavailable  other objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements and assigning the remainder of the arrangement fee to the license 
the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements may vary  due to the amount of judgment required to address significant assumptions  risks and uncertainties in applying the application of the percentage of completion methodology 
our specific revenue recognition policies are as follows software license fees license fee revenues from end users are recognized when the software product has been shipped  provided a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
provided the above criteria are met  license fee revenues from resellers are recognized when there is a sell through by a reseller to an end user 
a sell through is determined when we receive an order form from a reseller for a specific end user sale 
we do not generally offer rights of return  acceptance clauses or price protection to our customers 
in situations where software license contracts include rights of 
table of contents return or acceptance clauses  revenue is deferred until the clause expires 
typically  our software license fees are due within a month period from the date of shipment 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  or includes payment terms greater than twelve months from shipment  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple delivered elements such as software products or specified upgrades and undelivered elements such as support or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee according to the fair value of each element using vsoe 
vsoe of fair value is determined using the price charged when that element is sold separately 
in software arrangements in which we have fair value of all undelivered elements but not of a delivered element  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element and is recognized as revenue 
in software arrangements in which we do not have vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until fair value is determined or all elements for which we do not have vsoe of fair value  have been delivered 
maintenance and support revenues from customer maintenance and support contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
revenues for maintenance and support that are bundled with license fees are deferred based on the vsoe of fair value of the bundled maintenance and support and recognized over the term of the agreement 
vsoe of fair value is based on the renewal rate for continued maintenance and support arrangements 
consulting services revenues from consulting services including training and implementation services are recognized as services are provided to customers 
revenues for consulting services that are bundled with license fees are deferred based on the vsoe of fair value of the bundled services and recognized when the services are performed 
vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when training and consulting services are sold separately 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific customer reserves and the aging of our receivables 
this provision is included in operating expenses as a general and administrative expense 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors 
if the factors utilized in determining the allowance do not reflect future performance  then a change in the allowance would be necessary in the period such determination is made which would affect future results of operations 
sales returns and allowances 
we do not generally provide a contractual right of return 
however  in the course of arriving at practical business solutions to various warranty and other claims  we have allowed sales returns and allowances 
we record a provision against revenue for estimated sales returns and allowances on licenses and consulting in the same period the related revenues are recorded or when current information indicates additional amounts are required 
these estimates are based on historical experience determined by analysis of return activities  specifically identified customers and other known factors 
if the historical data we utilize does not reflect expected future performance  a change in the allowances would be recorded in the period such determination is made affecting future results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
the majority of our intangible assets and goodwill resulted from our april acquisition of intentia 
we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market 
table of contents value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate in which we operate 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  the undiscounted cash flows method is used to determine whether the long lived or intangible asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  the asset is considered impaired  and the impairment is measured by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value using the discounted cash flows method 
the discount rate utilized is based on management s best estimate of the related risks and return at the time the impairment assessment is made 
on an annual basis or if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable  we review our recorded goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
during fiscal and in prior years  we operated as one reporting unit and therefore compare the carrying amount of our goodwill to our market value 
market value is determined utilizing our market capitalization plus a control premium 
if our market value exceeds our carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if our carrying amount exceeds our market value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is the new accounting basis 
a subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed and the loss has been recognized 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes 
we operate in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside of the united states 
accordingly  our consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in various locations and the applicable rates 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the provision for income tax take into account forecasted earnings  current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with preparing our global tax provision  we must assess temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of specific items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
as part of this process  we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance  if required 
the determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions  judgments  and estimates  including historical operating results  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period  except as discussed below for pre acquisition deferred tax 
table of contents assets that had a pre acquisition valuation allowance  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  and related interpretations  through fiscal reductions to the valuation allowance related to intentia s deferred tax assets that existed as of the date of the acquisition of intentia are first credited against goodwill  then to the other identifiable assets existing at the date of acquisition  and then  once these assets have been reduced to zero  credited to the income tax provision 
a non cash provision will be credited against goodwill for the utilization of pre acquisition net operating losses that had been fully reserved in purchase accounting 
with our adoption of sfas no 
 business combinations revised  sfas r in fiscal  any future release of valuation allowances recorded through purchase accounting in relation to our acquisitions will be included as a decrease in our income tax provision rather than as an adjustment to goodwill 
contingencies 
we may  from time to time  have unresolved regulatory  legal  tax or other matters see note  commitments and contingencies 
we provide for contingent liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies as amended sfas 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas  a loss contingency is charged to income when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies that do not meet both conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
we expense all legal costs incurred to resolve regulatory  legal  tax  or other matters in the period incurred 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter to assess our potential financial exposure 
if a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated as defined by sfas  we reflect the estimated loss in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available to us at that time 
further  estimates of this nature are highly subjective  and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
litigation reserves 
the establishment of litigation reserves requires significant judgments concerning the ultimate outcome of pending litigation against us and our subsidiaries 
reserves established in the normal course of business are based on the application of sfas  which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an adverse outcome is probable and we are able to make a reasonable estimation of the probable loss 
reserves established in purchase accounting are based on fair value under sfas no 
 business combinations sfas so long as fair value can be determined within the purchase price allocation period  otherwise these are determined under sfas all such reserves exclude legal costs which are treated as period expenses when incurred 
litigation by its nature is uncertain and the determination of whether any particular case involves a probable loss and quantifying the amount of loss for purposes of establishing or adjusting applicable reserves requires us to exercise considerable judgment  which is applied as of a certain date 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new matters  developments in existing matters or if we determine to change our strategy with respect to the resolution of any particular matter

under sfas r  stock based employee compensation cost is recognized using the fair value based method for all new awards granted after june  and unvested awards outstanding at june  compensation costs for unvested stock options and non vested awards that were outstanding at june   are being recognized over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of those options and awards as previously calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures  using a straight line method 
we elected the modified prospective method in adopting sfas r  under which prior periods are not retroactively restated 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we use the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period of time employees will retain stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements and the risk free interest rate 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related expense recognized 
the assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent our best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future

we generate revenues from licensing software  providing maintenance on licensed products and providing consulting services 
we generally utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products  maintenance and consulting services are sold to our customers 
as our maintenance and consulting services are primarily attributable to our licensed products  growth in our maintenance and consulting services is generally tied to the level of our license contracting activity 
fiscal total revenues decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily driven by an million  or  decrease in consulting revenues as well as a decrease in license fees revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in our maintenance revenues 
fiscal total revenues increased to million as compared to million in fiscal year to date increases were experienced in all our revenue streams  with maintenance representing the largest dollar increase at million and license fees representing the largest percentage increase at 
license fees 
our license fees primarily consist of fees resulting from products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis 
product license fees result from a customer s licensing of a given software product for the first time or with a customer s licensing of additional users for previously licensed products 
for fiscal  license fees revenues decreased million to million  or  compared to fiscal as previously discussed  the weakened global economy has lengthened our sales cycle which negatively affected our license fees revenues during fiscal this decrease in license fees revenues was experienced in all of our geographies with emea  the americas and apac down approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the emea decrease of was due to lower sales of our m solutions in our manufacturing related verticals 
the americas decrease was primarily related to lower license fees in services industries outside of our targeted verticals and lower m license fees in our manufacturing vertical 
these decreases were somewhat offset by increased license fees revenues related to our equipment services management and rental  healthcare and strategic human capital management verticals 
the decrease in apac license fees revenues in fiscal was primarily related to decreased m licenses fees 
in addition  license fees revenues for fiscal were favorably impacted by a targeted sales campaign we offered to our existing s customer base during the second half of fiscal  primarily our fourth quarter 
this program provided special terms for our customers adding new products to their lawson solutions 
the total number of licensing transactions decreased in fiscal by to  as compared to  in fiscal the number of licensing transactions with new customers was compared to last year 
we entered into and license transactions between million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we entered into nine licensing transactions greater than million in the current year compared to last year 

table of contents license fees revenues for fiscal increased million or million  or  compared to fiscal the growth in license fee revenues was primarily driven by a net increase of million in new software licenses and an increase in the recognition of deferred license revenues of million 
the increase in deferred license revenue recognized included the effect of a purchase accounting adjustment made in connection with our acquisition of intentia 
this adjustment reduced intentia s deferred revenue balance and reduced the amount of deferred revenue recognized in fiscal these increases in license revenues were partially offset by a million increase in revenues currently deferred which was primarily due to a decrease in our average conversion rate of approximately five percentage points 
the decrease in our average conversion rate was primarily related to the deferral of certain significant contracts entered into during the second half of fiscal the total number of licensing transactions decreased by to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal primarily due to a reduction in the number of lawson system foundation lsf transactions in the current year 
the number of licensing transactions with new customers increased slightly to in fiscal compared to in fiscal our total licensing transactions greater than million also remained flat at maintenance 
our maintenance revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll and renew licensed products in our maintenance programs 
these fees are typically charged annually and are based on the license fees initially paid by the customer 
maintenance revenues can fluctuate based on the number and timing of new license contracts  renewal rates and price increases 
for fiscal  maintenance revenues increased million to million  or  compared to fiscal these increases were primarily driven by annual maintenance agreement renewals with associated price increases  the continued migration of our customers  primarily in our emea region  to new lawson bronze or silver maintenance agreements  as well as maintenance agreements associated with new customers 
these increases were somewhat offset by slightly higher cancellation rates as a result of the global economic downturn 
maintenance revenues for fiscal increased million to million  or  compared to fiscal this increase was primarily driven by the migration of our customers  primarily in our emea region  to lawson total care maintenance agreements under our comprehensive customer care program 
fiscal also benefited as compared to last year as a result of the million fair value purchase accounting adjustment reflected in fiscal maintenance revenues  which was partially offset by a similar million fair value adjustment in fiscal  both adjustments reduced maintenance revenues in the respective periods 
in addition  price increases and maintenance agreements associated with new customers also contributed to the increase in maintenance revenues 
fiscal renewal rates were stable through the year 
consulting 
our consulting revenues consist of services related to software installations  software implementations  customized development and training services for customers who have licensed our products 
consulting revenues have historically  and through the first quarter of fiscal  included revenues associated with our hardware business 
as of august  we have exited the hardware business  which represented a non core component of our business  to better concentrate our efforts on providing our solutions and related services to our targeted industries 
consulting revenues for fiscal decreased million to million  or  compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily related to fewer billable consultants in fiscal as compared to fiscal as well as lower bookings for our consulting and implementation services as a result of decreased licensing activity in fiscal for both new and existing customers 
this decrease in consulting revenues was experienced in all our geographies with our emea region showing the largest decreases of million to million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal emea s consulting revenues were also negatively impacted by execution issues which contributed to lower utilization as well as experiencing a lower billable rate per hour on certain fixed price projects 
in 
table of contents addition  hardware revenues decreased in fiscal compared to last year 
the decrease in hardware revenues was the result of exiting this non core component of our business during the first quarter of fiscal consulting revenues for fiscal increased million to million  or  compared to fiscal this was primarily attributable to a million increase resulting from higher billable hours in the americas and a global billing rate increase  a million increase in third party revenues  a million increase resulting from a reduction in free service hours provided to customers  and million related to the fiscal fair value purchase accounting adjustment associated with the intentia acquisition 
deferred revenue 
certain of our revenues are deferred when all conditions of revenue recognition have not been met 
deferred revenue represents revenue that is to be recognized in future periods when such conditions have been satisfied related to certain license agreements  maintenance contracts and certain consulting arrangements as discussed above 
we had total deferred revenues of million at may  compared to million at may  the following table sets forth the components of deferred revenue in thousands may  license fees maintenance consulting total deferred revenue less current portion deferred revenue non current in general  changes in the balance of our deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal cycles 
our renewal dates occur in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year with revenues being recognized ratably over the applicable service periods 
the decrease in the fiscal balance compared to fiscal  was primarily related to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates as of our billing cycle date

our software solutions may include embedded components of third party vendors for which a fee is paid to the vendor upon the sale of our products 
in addition  we resell third party products in conjunction with the license of our software solutions  which also results in a fee 
the cost of license fees is higher  as a percentage of revenues  when we resell products of third party vendors 
as a result  license fees gross margins will vary depending on the proportion of third party product sales in our revenue mix 
cost of license fees decreased million to million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in third party royalty fees driven by lower license fees volume and the mix of products sold in fiscal as well as a decrease in amortization expenses related to our acquired intellectual property 
license fees gross margin for fiscal was down slightly at compared to last year due to the lower license volume 
for fiscal  cost of license fees increased million to million  or  compared to fiscal this increase was primarily related to a million increase in amortization of intellectual property  a million increase in personnel costs related to the enhancement of our product delivery team which facilitates global license distribution and a million increase in allocations and other costs incurred to support the higher license revenues 
partially offsetting these increases was a net million decrease in third party costs related to the decline in lsf upgrade transactions discussed previously 
fiscal license fees gross margin increased to up from in fiscal primarily due to higher license volume  improved margins on third party products and fewer lower margin lsf upgrade transactions in our fiscal revenue mix

these decreases were somewhat offset by a million increase in costs related to our managed and hosted services offerings and a million increase in other expenses related to intercompany support services 
consulting gross margin for fiscal decreased to compared to in fiscal as our decrease in consulting revenues has outpaced the decrease in our cost of consulting primarily due to the timing of the employee actions taken in conjunction with our restructuring plans announced on november  and may  see note  restructuring  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for more information 
certain of these actions occurred late in february and in may such that our fiscal operations did not fully benefit from the reduced headcount 
we anticipate that the restructuring activities impact on our cost of consulting will lead to improved margins in future periods 
cost of consulting increased million to million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from a million increase in employee related costs to support the increase in headcount related to higher business demand  a million increase in third party costs associated with the higher third party revenues  and a million increase in infrastructure costs related to our global support centers 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in incentive compensation resulting from lower performance compared to utilization and margin targets and certain reductions based on management s discretion  a million decrease in amortization expense related to order backlog recorded as part of the intentia acquisition and fully amortized in fiscal  a million decrease in settlements of customer claims paid in fiscal with no similar amount in the current year  as well as a million decrease in stock based compensation expense

restructuring 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million compared to a restructuring accrual reversal of million in fiscal and million in restructuring charges during fiscal the fiscal credit relates to adjustments to the original estimates established in the fiscal restructuring accruals discussed below 
fiscal restructuring fiscal q on november   we announced the implementation of cost reduction measures in light of the uncertainty in global economic conditions and in light of other operating margin improvement initiatives 
these cost reduction initiatives included a restructuring plan which called for the reduction of approximately employees throughout our global workforce and the closing of one leased facility 
this reduction represented approximately of our global workforce and affected all functional areas of our operations 
we recorded the majority of the restructuring expenses with a pre tax charge of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal  including million for severance and related benefits and million for the exit of the leased facility 
we had anticipated a certain level of voluntary attrition that  in conjunction with limited hiring and the actions taken under this restructuring plan  would result in an estimated total reduction in our global workforce 
however  we experienced less voluntary attrition than estimated as weakness in the global economy continued through the third quarter of fiscal therefore  we took additional actions under the plan during the third quarter  including the reduction of employees  primarily in our services organization  representing approximately of our global workforce 
we also exited one additional leased facility under the plan during the third quarter 
these actions resulted in an additional pre tax charge of approximately million recorded in the third quarter of fiscal including million for severance and related benefits and million for lease termination fees incurred for the exit of the additional leased facility 
the third quarter charge of million together with the charge of million recorded in the second quarter resulted in a total pre tax charge related to the plan of approximately million  within our original estimated range of between million and million 
we recorded million in adjustments to the accrual related to these actions in fiscal we do not anticipate taking any significant additional charges related to this plan in future 
table of contents periods 
we estimate that the annualized cost savings from all actions taken in relation to this plan will be approximately million 
actions relating to severance were substantially completed by february  with related cash payments expected to continue through december payments related to the exited facilities are expected to continue through november fiscal q on may   we initiated a plan to restructure our workforce 
we are beginning a realignment of our organizational structure to provide greater focus on our targeted vertical markets 
the restructuring involves the reduction of certain resources outside our targeted markets while further investing in resources that will support these markets  elimination of certain positions due to operational efficiencies and lowering costs overall in light of the current weakness in global business conditions 
under this plan  we will reduce our workforce by approximately employees  or of our global workforce  and consolidate space in certain of our leased facilities related to our international operations 
notification to employees affected by the realignment began on may  and personnel departures are expected to be completed by the end of the company s third quarter of fiscal the strategic workforce realignment actions resulted in pre tax charges of approximately million for severance and related benefits and the consolidation of leased facilities resulted in pre tax charges of approximately million which we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal annualized cost savings from these actions are estimated to be approximately million 
however  the company will reinvest a portion of these savings to fund newly created positions to support a new vertical organization structure which the company intends to implement 
hiring for the new positions is expected to occur over the course of fiscal the company expects the majority of the severance and related benefits to be paid within the next months while the leased facilities costs will be paid through december in relation to all restructuring activities taken in fiscal  we made cash payments of million relating to severance and related benefits and million related to the exited facilities

amortization of acquired intangibles 
amortization of acquired intangibles primarily relates to the on going amortization of intangibles acquired in the intentia merger as well as other acquisitions

the year over year decreases in our average investment balances and related investment income were also the result of our investments in auction rate securities being sold in the first quarter of fiscal  as well as a decrease in our investments in marketable securities during fiscal we have transitioned our investments to cash and cash equivalents  primarily treasuries and money market funds  and as a result we have experienced lower yields in fiscal as compared to fiscal we anticipate that these lower interest yields will continue through fiscal in addition  interest expense decreased million in fiscal compared to last year

the rate for the year was also negatively impacted by for unbenefited foreign losses 
in april  the company acquired intentia 
as of the date of the acquisition  many of the intentia legal entities had deferred tax assets for which which future realization of tax benefits was uncertain and therefore had a full valuation allowance applied against them 
under the provisions of sfas  if acquired deferred tax assets are ultimately expected to be realized and related valuation allowances are reversed this will not result in a tax benefit but rather a reduction of goodwill 
however  with our adoption of sfas r in fiscal  any future release of valuation allowances originally recorded through purchase accounting in relation to our acquisitions will be included as a benefit in our tax provision rather than as an adjustment to goodwill

senior convertible notes in april  we issued million of senior convertible notes with net proceeds  after expenses  of approximately million 
the notes mature on april  the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semi annually in arrears  on april and october of each year  beginning october  the notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants 
the notes are convertible  at the holder s option  into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share which reflects a conversion premium based on the closing sale price of per share of lawson common stock as reported by nasdaq on april

we had certain business relationships with lehman otc  including a convertible note hedge transaction and a warrant transaction both entered into as part of the issuance of our senior convertible notes and an accelerated share repurchase transaction see  repurchase of common shares  below for additional information 
on september   lehman brothers holdings inc lehman holdings filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of new york 
subsidiaries of lehman holdings  including lehman brothers inc lehman brothers and lehman otc  were not included in the filing 
on september   lehman brothers was placed in liquidation under the securities investor protection act 
in addition  on october   lehman otc also filed for chapter bankruptcy 
lehman brothers was one of the original purchasers of our senior convertible notes 
none of the net proceeds from the offering are on deposit with lehman brothers or any of its affiliates 
in conjunction with the issuance of the notes  we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction with lehman otc  an affiliate of lehman brothers 
in a separate agreement  we entered into a warrant transaction with lehman otc 
together  these transactions were designed to reduce the potential dilution resulting from the potential conversion of our senior convertible notes into shares of common stock and effectively increased the conversion price of the notes to per share from the initial conversion price of the notes of per share 
the bankruptcy filings of lehman holdings  as guarantor under the convertible note hedge transaction  and the bankruptcy filing by lehman otc were events of default under the hedge transaction and warrant agreements 
as a result of these defaults  we exercised our rights to terminate both the hedge transaction and the warrant transaction on october  as a result of our termination of the hedge transaction  terms of the original transaction provided us the right to seek recovery from lehman otc equal to the termination date fair value of the common stock option instrument we issued in connection with the hedge transaction 
at the time of termination  the instrument ceased being a hedge instrument and was effectively replaced by our claim against lehman otc 
accordingly  during the second quarter of fiscal we recorded this claim against lehman otc as an asset 
on june   counsel for lehman holdings and lehman otc demanded payment from us of the termination date fair value of the warrant  asserted that in the contracts we have waived the right to setoff against the amounts owed to us under the hedge transaction and claimed we violated the bankruptcy stay in asserting setoff rights 
we have refused payment and contend that the contracts and the us bankruptcy code give us legal rights in this dispute 
for financial reporting purposes  we estimated the fair value of the hedge transaction asset and the warrant liability using the black scholes option pricing model and considered the credit risk of lehman otc 
these terminations resulted in a decrease in stockholders equity equal to the net amount of the recorded asset and liability 
the fair value of these obligations recorded for financial reporting purposes may differ from the values ultimately determined in various legal proceedings  including actions of the us bankruptcy court 
if the ultimate settlement of either of these obligations differs from the recorded amounts  we will be required to recognize any related gain or loss in our results of operations in the period such settlement is known 
as of may   our claim against lehman holdings and lehman otc and lehman holdings and lehman otc s claim against us had not been settled 
the terms of the senior convertible notes and the rights of note holders are not affected by the status of lehman holdings or lehman otc or by any termination of the hedge transaction or warrant 
restricted cash we had million held as restricted cash as of may  of which million and million have been classified as current and non current assets respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
the current portion relates primarily to the million held in our segregated 
table of contents brokerage account at lehman otc 
see note  common stock  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information 
the remainder of the restricted cash balance relate to various collateral arrangements related to our property leases worldwide 
the million balance as of may  related to various guarantees 
of the million  million was classified as current and the remaining million was classified as non current on our consolidated balance sheets 
auction rate securities as of may   we held a total of million in short term investments in auction rate securities reflecting an million impairment from their original par value of approximately million 
these investments were governed by our investment policy  the objective of which is to provide as high a level of current income as is consistent with preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity 
approved investments include us government securities and investments in corporations and municipalities rated aa or higher  including investments in auction rate securities 
our investments in auction rate securities represented interests in collateralized debt obligations and were supported primarily by high grade  short term commercial paper 
during fiscal  uncertainties in the credit markets had a significant effect on our holdings in auction rate securities 
auctions related to our investments in auction rate securities became unsuccessful and liquidity issues relating to these investments resulted in a decline in the fair value of our portfolio of auction rate securities 
this resulted in our recording impairment losses related to these investments 
on july   we sold our auction rate securities portfolio for million in cash  the carrying value as of may  in light of this transaction  the million of impairment losses previously recorded in the second and third quarters of fiscal and originally determined to be temporary and reflected in a separate component of stockholders equity were reclassified as other than temporary and included in our results of operations for fiscal as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million for fiscal which was included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we reclassified the presentation of our auction rate securities to short term investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of may  repurchase of common shares our board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to million of common stock in november  and on july   increased the maximum authorized for repurchase under the program to million 
the share repurchases are funded using our existing cash balances and future cash flows and may occur through transactions structured through investment banking institutions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements  open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions and or other mechanisms 
our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion and market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased 
there can be no assurance as to the amount  timing or repurchase price of future repurchases  if any  related to the share repurchase program 
the program may also be modified  extended or terminated by our board of directors at any time 
from inception of the repurchase program through may   we used million to repurchase million shares at an average price of per share 
the repurchased shares are recorded as treasury stock and result in a reduction to our stockholders equity 
the shares will be used for general corporate purposes 
as of may   the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under this program was million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share under the share repurchase program 
of these shares  million were purchased in four private transactions from may  through may  
table of contents from an affiliate of dr 
romesh wadhwani  our co chairman and a member of our board of directors at an average price of per share 
we repurchased these shares at a discount from the closing market price of our common stock on the respective dates of purchase 
as required under our corporate governance policy  these related party transactions were approved by our audit committee and the other disinterested members of our board of directors 
during the first quarter of fiscal we purchased million shares through an accelerated share repurchase transaction the asr that we entered into with lehman otc on july  pursuant to the asr transaction  we were to repurchase a variable number of shares of our outstanding common stock from lehman otc for million 
the final per share purchase price and the total number of shares to be repurchased under the asr transaction were to be based generally on the volume weighted average price of lawson s common stock during the term of the agreement 
the average price per share of the shares purchased under the asr transaction was  which was inclusive of million which is still held in our segregated brokerage account at lehman otc 
lehman otc delivered million shares of our common stock to us through august  under the agreement  lehman otc was obligated to deliver additional shares to us at maturity of the transaction based on the final per share purchase price and the total number of shares repurchased as determined primarily by the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement 
the agreement further required that lehman post cash collateral to a segregated brokerage account in our name in an amount equal to the value of the additional shares  or net cash  due to us if the asr were terminated as of the current date 
upon an event of default by lehman otc  pursuant to our rights under the asr  we issued a notice of default to lehman otc on september  and terminated the asr agreement and requested the distribution of all million of funds held in our segregated brokerage account at lehman brothers 
as of may   we continue to seek the transfer of such funds to a new account in accordance with procedures established by the trustee appointed to oversee the liquidation of lehman brothers 
we believe these funds are free credit balances that we are entitled to receive from the trustee 
as of the date of this filing we had not yet received these funds  but have recorded them as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets as of may  we believe that we are entitled to receive an additional million from lehman otc pursuant to the terms of the asr agreement related to additional cash collateral that should have been posted to our segregated brokerage account 
lehman otc failed to post that million amount to our segregated brokerage account 
we do not know if the bankruptcy trustee will allow our million claim for that amount 
however  if the bankruptcy trustee allows our claim  collection of all or any portion of the million is uncertain because that claim is not secured by any collateral or segregated account 
accordingly  we have not recorded this additional million as an asset in our consolidated balance sheets as of may  we previously received the million shares repurchased under the asr 
we currently believe that the lehman holdings bankruptcy  and its potential impact on subsidiaries of lehman holdings  the liquidation of lehman brothers inc  and the bankruptcy of lehman otc  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we continue to closely monitor the lehman holdings bankruptcy situation  the liquidation of lehman brothers inc  as well as the lehman otc bankruptcy  and our legal rights under our contractual relationships with lehman otc 
included in the repurchases in fiscal were million shares purchased from the lawson family investment company  ltd  an entity affiliated with h

recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb which impacts the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlements 
fsp apb will impact the accounting associated with our million senior convertible notes 
this fsp will require us to recognize significant additional non cash interest expense based on the market rate for similar debt instruments that do not contain a comparable conversion feature 
furthermore  it requires recognition of interest expense in prior periods pursuant to the retrospective accounting treatment 
fsp apb is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal and early adoption is not permitted 
upon 
table of contents adoption of fsp apb beginning on june  we will record additional non cash interest expense of approximately million to million annually or million to million per fiscal quarter

in december  the fasb issued sfas r which will significantly change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
some of the changes  such as the accounting for contingent consideration and exclusion of transaction costs from acquisition accounting may introduce more volatility into earnings 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  our fiscal 
with the adoption of sfas r  our accounting for future business combinations will change on a prospective basis beginning with any business combination for which the acquisition date is in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  any restructuring liabilities established in connection with integration of an acquired entity will generally have a negative impact on our future operating results as they will not be accounted for as part of the business combination but will be expensed when incurred 
in relation to previous acquisitions  the provisions of sfas r will require any release of existing income tax valuation allowances initially established through purchase accounting to be included in our earnings rather than as an adjustment to goodwill 
this would have the effect of reducing our income tax provision in future periods when such valuation allowances are reversed

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a separate component of equity rather than as a liability

we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
our market risk includes the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenue was denominated in a foreign currency 
we manage foreign currency market risk using forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are expected to be offset by gains or losses on forward contracts 
this is expected to mitigate the possibility of significant foreign currency transaction gains or losses in future periods 
our foreign currency exposures are primarily related to non functional currency intercompany loans and advances to from our international subsidiaries as well as non functional currency transactions  included in other balance sheet accounts particularity accounts receivable  accounts payable and certain accrual accounts 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
in fiscal and prior years  we have not designated these derivative contracts as hedge transactions under sfas no 
accounting derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  sfas  and have not used hedge accounting 
our 
table of contents foreign currency forward contracts are generally short term in nature  maturing within days or less 
we mark to market all contracts at the end of each reporting period 
these unrealized gains and losses largely offset gains and losses from non functional currency balance sheet exposures previously recognized and are recorded as an offset to such gains and losses in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
our net realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
we recorded net foreign exchange gains inclusive of the impact of foreign currency forward contracts of million for fiscal  net losses of million for fiscal and net gains of million for fiscal  respectively 
the corresponding net gains of million  net losses of million  and net gains of million in realized and unrealized gains from foreign currency forward contracts were included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during fiscal  and  respectively 
the net fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was a net liability of million as of may  and a net asset of million as of may  and was included in other accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses and other current assets  respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 
interest rates 
our investments consist of financial instruments  primarily money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  and the u 
s 
government and agencies 
as of may    these investments were primarily denominated in us dollars 
investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents 
as of may   the average maturity of our investment securities was less than three months and all investment securities had maturities less than months 
as of may   we consider the reported amounts of these investments to be reasonable approximations of fair values 
we do not consider changes in the market interest rates related to these investments to be a significant risk 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our senior convertible notes due april  the fair value of our convertible senior notes may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
our senior convertible notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per year
