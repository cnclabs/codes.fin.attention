executive overview legg mason  inc  a holding company  with its subsidiaries which collectively comprise legg mason is a global asset management firm 
acting through our subsidiaries  we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients  company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles 
we offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries 
we have operations principally in the united states of america and the united kingdom and also have offices in australia  bahamas  brazil  canada  chile  china  dubai  france  germany  italy  japan  luxembourg  poland  singapore  spain and taiwan 
we operate in one reportable business segment  asset management 
in connection with changes to our executive management during fiscal and a desire to expand multi channel distribution capabilities and to better align our resources to access new growth opportunities  we realigned our management responsibilities 
as a result  we now manage our business in two divisions or operating segments  americas and international  which are primarily based on the geographic location of the advisor or the domicile of fund families we manage 
our division managers report directly to our chief executive officer 
the americas division consists of our us domiciled fund families  the separate account businesses of our us based investment affiliates and the domestic distribution organization 
similarly  the international division consists of our fund complexes  distribution teams and investment affiliates located outside the us we believe this structure will provide greater focus and allow us to maximize distribution efforts and more efficiently take advantage of growth opportunities locally and abroad 
presentation of all previously reported amounts have been conformed to the new management structure 
our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees  from separate accounts and funds  and distribution and service fees 
investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage 
in addition  performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks 
distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios  and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio 
our revenues  therefore  are dependent upon the level of our assets under management  and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions  our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel  and investment performance 
our assets under management primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets and market performance 
client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management  and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services  may be based on one or more of a number of factors 
these factors include our reputation in the marketplace  the investment performance  both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products  of our products and services  the client or potential client s situation  including investment objectives  liquidity needs  investment horizon and amount of assets managed  our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment  including market conditions 
the fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product  the amount of assets under management  and the type of services and investment objectives that are provided 
fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services 
accordingly  our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we may reduce or waive investment management fees  or limit total expenses  on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses  or for other reasons  and to help retain or increase managed assets 
under revenue sharing agreements  certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs  including compensation 
as such  our net income  profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues  and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary 

table of contents the most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits  of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits 
the next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees  which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature 
certain other operating costs are fixed in nature  such as occupancy  depreciation and amortization  and fixed contract commitments for market data  communication and technology services  and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or  conversely  usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity 
our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets  particularly in the united states  but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate 
results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results 
our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors  including the amount and composition of our assets under management  and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates  among other things 
sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely 
in addition  the diversification of services and products offered  investment performance  access to distribution channels  reputation in the market  attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients 
the economic downturn of the past year contributed to a significant contraction in our business 
the financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive 
our competition includes numerous global  national  regional and local asset management firms  broker dealers and commercial banks 
the industry has been dramatically impacted by the economic downturn of the past year  and in prior years by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  the fixed income markets have endured substantial turmoil 
one effect of this turmoil was that liquidity in the markets for many types of asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by structured investment vehicles sivs became substantially reduced 
as a result  and to protect our clients  we entered into several arrangements during fiscal and to provide support to liquidity funds that are managed by a subsidiary that had invested in siv securities 
the industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal  state  and foreign laws 
like most firms  we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes 
responding to these changes has required us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability

business environment and results of operations the financial environment globally and in the united states was volatile during fiscal and challenging market conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year 
the sharp decline in equity markets and continuing dislocations in the credit markets adversely affected the entire financial sector during fiscal the equity markets suffered from pullback in consumer spending  which led to weak performance in global markets  increased unemployment  and significant declines in the values of assets owned by financial institutions 
investors confidence continued to weaken  which caused a shift in the markets from equity and corporate bonds to us treasury notes and bonds 
as a result  all three major us equity market indices declined sharply during the fiscal year 
the dow jones industrial average  nasdaq composite index and the s p were down  and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
the barclays capital us aggregate bond index increased and the barclays capital global aggregate bond index decreased 
during fiscal  the federal reserve board reduced the discount rate by to the current rate of 
our results were negatively impacted by many of these factors 
the financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal we expect the challenges presented by the credit markets to persist throughout the next fiscal year 
we cannot predict how these uncertainties will impact the company s results

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal financial overview net loss for the year ended march  totaled billion  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in the prior year 
during fiscal  we eliminated the exposure to sivs of all liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary by purchasing and subsequently selling  or reimbursing the funds for a portion of the losses they incurred in selling  all securities issued by sivs held in our liquidity funds and held by us 
the majority of these siv securities were supported under capital support arrangements  letters of credit or a total return swap trs prior to the purchase 
these transactions  along with charges related to remaining capital support arrangements that support securities other than sivs  resulted in aggregate charges during the fiscal year of billion 
also  during fiscal  impairment charges of billion were recorded  related to goodwill and intangible assets  primarily in our former wealth management division  as a result of declines in the assets under management aum and projected cash flows of affiliates in that division  and a reduction in the value of certain acquired management contract intangible assets and a related trade name 
cash loss from continuing operations see supplemental non gaap financial information was billion  or per diluted share  compared to cash income of million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
these decreases were primarily due to an increase in net losses related to the elimination of siv exposure  net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments  of billion  or per diluted share  and an increase in pre tax impairment charges of billion  or per diluted share 
the pre tax profit margin from continuing operations declined to from in the prior year 
the pretax profit margin from continuing operations  as adjusted see supplemental non gaap financial information  declined to from in the prior year

there were net client outflows in all asset classes 
the majority of outflows were in fixed income with billion  or of the outflows  followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of billion and billion  respectively 
the majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by western asset management company western asset that have experienced investment performance issues  especially over the last fiscal year 
equity outflows were primarily experienced by key equity products managed at clearbridge advisors llc clearbridge  legg mason capital management  inc lmcm and permal 
due in part to investment performance issues  we have experienced net equity outflows since fiscal we generally earn higher fees and profits on equity aum  and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes 
in addition  due in part to recent investment performance issues  we have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class for the past five quarters 

table of contents our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice  and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice 
institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us  reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management  or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates  changes in our reputation in the marketplace  changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships  loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance 
in response to the unprecedented market turmoil  during the december quarter  permal temporarily modified its redemption notice timing to require day prior notification rather than the historical days 
with the objective of returning to the day notice period by january  the current day notice period for redemptions will be reduced to days beginning with the september  redemption date

table of contents in the fixed income markets  the economic crisis deepened  but the government s numerous actions laid the foundation for a recovery  causing investor confidence to improve modestly late in the march quarter 
the new fiscal stimulus package designed to aid the economy  and the government s intention to issue more public debt for financing  caused yields to rise during the quarter 
for the year period  treasury yields have decreased significantly while long term rates have increased resulting in a steeper yield curve

table of contents results of operations operating revenues revenues from continuing operations for the year ended march  were billion  down from billion in the prior year primarily as a result of an decrease in average aum  due to a decline in average equity assets of approximately and fixed income assets of approximately 
the shift in the mix of aum from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of fixed income and liquidity assets also contributed to the revenue decline 
operating revenues were also negatively impacted by a decline in performance fees of approximately million  or 
investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased million  or  to billion 
of this decrease  million was the result of lower average equity assets at pcm  clearbridge  lmcm and brandywine global investment management  llc brandywine  million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at western asset  and million was the result of the sale of the legg mason private portfolio group lmppg business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the sale 
investment advisory fees from funds decreased million  or  to billion 
of this decrease approximately million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at lmcm  clearbridge  permal  and royce  approximately million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at western asset  offset by approximately million which was the result of increased liquidity assets managed  primarily at western asset 
performance fees decreased  or million  to million during fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in performance fees earned on alternative investment products at permal 
distribution and service fees decreased to million primarily as a result of a decline in average aum of the retail share classes of our domestic and international equity funds  which resulted in a decrease of million 
operating expenses during the past year  market conditions have contributed to a reduction in our aum  revenues and earnings 
as discussed above  although a significant portion of our expenses are variable and largely increase or decrease proportionately with revenue  a portion of our expenses are fixed and do not decline with reduced revenues 
as a result of the substantial decline in revenues during fiscal  certain actions were taken to reduce our corporate cost structure 
these cost saving measures primarily include reductions in headcount and discretionary incentive compensation in administrative and business support functions  significant reductions in the utilization of consultants for technology projects  and substantial curtailment of travel and entertainment costs 
these measures  and other less significant actions  have resulted in the elimination of approximately million in costs on an annualized basis  before costs incurred to achieve these savings  such as severance 
the discussion below for each of our operating expenses identifies the amount of variance attributable to cost savings achieved in fiscal  where applicable 
compensation and benefits decreased to billion 
this decrease was primarily driven by a million decrease in revenue share based compensation related to lower revenues in fiscal  the impact of cost savings initiatives  such as reductions in headcount  discretionary incentives and other discretionary compensation that lowered compensation by approximately million and a decrease in deferred compensation obligations of approximately million resulting from market losses on invested assets of deferred compensation plans which are largely offset by losses in other non operating expense 
these decreases were offset in part by lower incentive compensation reductions of million related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that held siv issued securities 
compensation as a percentage of operating revenues decreased slightly to from in the prior fiscal year as compensation reductions related to unrealized market losses on deferred compensation plans were substantially offset by fixed compensation costs of administrative and sales personnel which do not vary with revenues 
distribution and servicing expenses decreased to million  primarily as a result of a decrease in average aum in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors 
communications and technology expense decreased to million  primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that led to an million decrease in 
table of contents technology consulting fees  offset in part by a million increase in market data costs for services previously included in other expenses  and a million increase in depreciation expense related to investment management infrastructure 
occupancy expense increased to million  primarily as a result of lease reserves related to office vacancies totaling million and accelerated depreciation of assets in vacated space of million 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to million  primarily as a result of the sale of the lmppg business  which reduced amortization expense by million  and the impact of the impairment of intangible assets in fiscal year  which reduced amortization expense by million 
impairment charges increased to billion 
approximately billion of the total impairment charges relate to goodwill and intangible assets in our former wealth management division as a result of significant declines in the aum and a reduction in projected cash flows of the division 
the remaining million relates to certain acquired management contracts  as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition  and a related trade name 
see critical accounting policies and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment charges 
other expenses decreased million to million  primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that resulted in reduced travel and entertainment costs of million  lower professional fees of million and lower advertising costs of million 
in addition  the sale of the lmppg overlay and implementation business eliminated support costs of approximately million 
operating expenses in fiscal will continue to benefit from the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal in addition  we have planned and are in the process of implementing additional cost reductions to bring the total amount to million on an annualized basis by september  however  our business is dynamic and requires us to incur incremental expenses from time to time to grow and better support the business 
for example  operating expenses in fiscal will reflect incremental costs of approximately million associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
in addition  from time to time we fill key positions and take actions to retain key talent that would require additional compensation 
as discussed above  during fiscal  we will relocate our corporate headquarters 
we are currently pursuing sub tenants for certain floors under lease that will be unoccupied as a result of headcount reductions 
given the current commercial real estate market  at the time we secure a sub lease or the space is deemed to be permanently abandoned  we will likely recognize a charge for the present value of the amount by which our commitment under our lease exceeds the amount due to us under the expected sub lease terms 
however  subsequent to any such charge  occupancy expense will be reduced by the amount of our lease costs attributable to the sublet floors 
non operating income expense interest income decreased to million primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates earned on investment balances  which decreased interest income by million  offset in part by higher average investment account balances due to proceeds from the issuance of debt  which increased interest income by million 
interest expense increased to million as a result of higher debt levels 
we raised billion in may by issuing equity units  and billion by issuing convertible senior notes in january  which resulted in an increase of approximately million in interest expense 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of the repayment of million principal amount of senior notes in july and lower interest rates paid on our term loan  which together resulted in a decrease of million 
during fiscal  interest expense will increase by million as a result of the adoption of fasb staff position fsp no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  related to our convertible senior notes 
see other recent accounting developments in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on this fsp 
fund support losses increased billion  primarily as a result of continued siv price deterioration and our elimination of siv exposure 
see note of notes to 
table of contents consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other non operating income expense decreased million to a loss of million  primarily as a result of an increase of million in unrealized market losses on assets held in deferred compensation plans  which are offset by corresponding compensation reductions discussed above  and million in unrealized market losses on investments in proprietary fund products 
income tax benefit the income tax benefit was billion compared to income tax expense of million in the prior year  primarily as a result of the losses related to liquidity fund support and charges for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
the effective tax rate was a benefit of in the current year compared to a provision in the prior year 
the current year benefit rate is primarily driven by the impact of the siv related charges with lower state tax benefits 
in addition  the current year includes approximately million in tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary  offset by the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge 
supplemental non gaap financial information cash income from continuing operations as supplemental information  we are providing a performance measure that is based on a methodology other than generally accepted accounting principles non gaap for cash income from continuing operations that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of legg mason 
we define cash income from continuing operations as income loss from continuing operations  plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment 
we believe that cash income loss from continuing operations provides a good representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and it facilitates comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions  including any related goodwill or intangible asset impairments 
we also believe that cash income loss from continuing operations is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business 
this measure is provided in addition to income from continuing operations  but is not a substitute for income from continuing operations and may not be comparable to non gaap performance measures  including measures of cash earnings or cash income  of other companies 
further  cash income from continuing operations is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under gaap 
we consider cash income from continuing operations to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies  as an indicator of value and because it facilitates comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions 
in calculating cash income from continuing operations  we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions  such as management contracts  to income from continuing operations to reflect the fact that this non cash expense makes it difficult to compare our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions 
deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under gaap absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business 
because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill over time  we add them to income in the calculation of cash income from continuing operations 
conversely  we subtract income taxes on these impairment charges that have been recognized under gaap 
should a disposition or impairment charge occur on indefinite life intangible assets or goodwill  its impact on cash income from continuing operations may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm 
accordingly  we monitor changes in indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill and the related impact  including taxes  on cash income from continuing operations to ensure appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany disclosures of cash income from continuing operations 
although depreciation and amortization on fixed assets are non cash expenses  we do not add these charges in calculating cash income from continuing operations because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement 

table of contents a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to cash income from continuing operations in thousands except per share is as follows for the years ended march  income loss from continuing operations plus less amortization of intangible assets deferred income taxes on intangible assets deferred income taxes on impairment charges cash income loss from continuing operations cash income loss from continuing operations per diluted share income loss from continuing operations per diluted share amortization of intangible assets deferred income taxes on intangible assets deferred income taxes on impairment charges cash income loss from continuing operations per diluted share the decrease in cash income from continuing operations was primarily due to an increase in pre tax impairment charges of billion  or per diluted share  and an increase in net losses related to the elimination of siv exposure of billion  or per diluted share 
pre tax profit margin from continuing operations  as adjusted we believe that pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense is a useful measure of our performance because it indicates what our margins would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products  and thus shows the effect of these revenues on our margins 
this measure is provided in addition to the company s pre tax profit margin from continuing operations calculated under gaap  but is not a substitute for calculations of margin under gaap and may not be comparable to non gaap performance measures  including measures of adjusted margins  of other companies

performance fees decreased  or million  to million during fiscal  primarily as a result of decreases in performance fees earned by western asset  and lmcm  which were partially offset by an increase in performance fees earned by permal 

table of contents distribution and service fees decreased to million primarily as a result of a decline in average aum of the retail share classes of our domestic equity funds 
operating expenses compensation and benefits remained flat at billion  as increased revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues along with higher salary and benefits at certain of our subsidiaries were substantially offset by incentive expense reductions related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that hold siv issued securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these charges related to our liquidity business 
compensation as a percentage of operating revenues was for fiscal  down from for fiscal  primarily as a result of a reduction in compensation resulting from adjustments related to liquidity fund support 
distribution and servicing expenses increased to billion  primarily as a result of increased average aum at permal and in liquidity assets for which we pay higher relative fees to third party distributors 
communications and technology expense increased to million  primarily as a result of increased depreciation expense  technology maintenance  and other expenditures related to investment management and business continuity infrastructure and office relocations 
occupancy expense increased to million  primarily as a result of higher rent at new office locations and the impact of duplicate rent on facilities during relocation periods 
expense for impairment of management contracts was million  related to the impairment of certain acquired management contracts as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition than previously estimated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment of management contracts 
other operating expenses increased to million  driven primarily by increased promotional expenses  offset in part by decreased expenses under a transition services agreement with citigroup related to the integration of businesses acquired from citigroup and prior year losses on the disposal of certain fixed assets as a result of office relocations 
other income expense interest income increased million to million  primarily as a result of higher average firm investment account balances  offset in part by a decline in average interest rates earned on these balances 
interest expense increased million to million due to million of new borrowings under our billion unsecured revolving credit facility and the issuance of billion of convertible senior notes in january  offset in part by million of principal reduction made on our million term loan 
other non operating income expense decreased million to a loss of million  primarily as a result of losses related to liquidity fund support of approximately million  which excludes million of financing costs included in interest expense 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to million  primarily as a result of lower earnings due to losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment of acquired management contract assets recorded during fiscal the effective tax rate increased to from in the prior year primarily reflecting an increase in earnings in higher state income tax rate jurisdictions as a result of the impairment and liquidity fund support charges at lower relative state income tax rates

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support our business strategies and to provide needed liquidity at all times  including maintaining required capital in certain subsidiaries 
liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations 
during fiscal and  we entered into a series of arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that had invested in asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by sivs 
these arrangements are described in the liquidity fund support section below 
our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses 
in order to ensure adequate resources for the liquidity fund support transactions as well as for general corporate purposes  we increased our capital base by billion through the issuance of equity units during fiscal we intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business 
these opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require  among other things  and  subject to existing covenants  the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt 
our assets consist primarily of intangible assets  goodwill  cash and cash equivalents  refundable income taxes  investment advisory and related fee receivables and investment securities 
our assets have been principally funded by equity capital  long term debt and the results of our ongoing operations 
at march   our cash  total assets  long term debt and stockholders equity were billion  billion  billion and billion  respectively 
the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended march in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows used for investing activities cash flows from used for financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  end of year cash flows from operating activities were million during fiscal compared to cash flows of  million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in operating cash flows is primarily due to lower earnings driven by aum and revenue declines in the current year 
cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal were billion  primarily attributable to the purchase of siv securities from our liquidity funds  which used billion  including million of net cash collateral returned upon termination of associated support agreements 
as discussed below  the liquidity fund support payments were funded in part with a portion of the proceeds of two debt issuances during calendar year the outflows were offset  in part  by proceeds from the sale of securities purchased under agreements to resell and siv securities of million and million  respectively  cash proceeds of million received for the sale of lmppg and the return of a portion of a contingent earnout payment from the pcm acquisition of million that was previously funded into escrow 
cash flows from financing activities provided million  primarily due to the billion in net proceeds from the offering of equity units in may  offset in part by the repayment of the million senior notes in july and the million repayment on our million unsecured revolving credit facility in march a portion of the proceeds of the equity units offering and a billion offering of convertible senior notes in january has been used to help fund the liquidity fund support and the senior notes repayment discussed above 
in fiscal  and  we paid cash dividends of million  million  and million  respectively 
on may   the board of directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share  representing a quarterly reduction of per share from our prior dividend 

table of contents we expect that over the next twelve months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs 
during the past year  difficult market conditions have contributed to a reduction in our aum and revenues and resulted in a reduction in the cash generated by our operations  which is our primary source of added liquidity 
if this trend continues  we would expect that the available cash generated by our operations would continue to decrease 
however  in an effort to mitigate the effects of declining market conditions and lower revenue levels  we have reduced our corporate expenses by approximately million on an annualized basis as of march   excluding costs to achieve these savings  such as severance  and have planned additional reductions of approximately million in fiscal in addition  we also expect to receive approximately million in tax refunds in fiscal  primarily attributable to the carry back tax benefit on the realized losses incurred on the sale of siv securities 
these refunds are expected to be received in the next six months 
during fiscal  we initiated a plan to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately million from certain foreign subsidiaries in order to replenish funds used for the contingent acquisition payment in the us to the former owners of permal 
we repatriated approximately million of these funds during fiscal we anticipate repatriating additional amounts starting in fiscal year  although timing is currently uncertain 
any repatriated amounts will effectively increase our available cash 
in addition to our ordinary operating cash needs  as discussed above  we anticipate several other cash needs during the next twelve months 
in november  we may be required to pay up to million under the agreements governing the permal acquisition  with the amount of the payment to be determined based on permal s operating results 
the final payment for this transaction in november will be between million and million based on permal s results and the amount of the fiscal payment 
we may pay up to of each of these payments in shares of our common stock 
in addition  during fiscal  we will move into a new corporate headquarters and expect to incur total costs for the new building of approximately million  primarily for leasehold improvements  fixtures and furniture  of which approximately million was paid during the year ended march  as discussed below  if our earnings remain at current levels  we would expect to repay a portion of our bank debt by december we may also elect to utilize our available resources for any number of activities  including seed capital investments in new products  repayment of outstanding debt  or acquisitions 
as described above  we currently project that our available cash and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
accordingly  we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect  currently unexpected events may occur that require additional liquidity  such as an acquisition opportunity  or market conditions might significantly worsen  affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash 
if this were to occur  we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as additional cost cutting  reducing our expected expenditures on investments  selling assets such as investment securities  repatriating earnings from foreign subsidiaries  or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees 
should these types of actions prove insufficient  we may seek to raise additional equity or debt 
however  current market conditions would make it difficult to raise additional capital  and would increase the costs of doing so 
in addition  our debt covenants currently prevent us from incurring more than million in additional indebtedness 

table of contents financing transactions the table below reflects our primary sources of financing in thousands as of march  amount outstanding at march  face amount type interest rate maturity convertible senior notes    january senior notes from equity units   june revolving credit agreement    libor october year term loan    libor october senior notes   july in may  we issued million equity units for billion  of which million was used to pay issuance costs 
each unit consists of a interest in  principal amount of senior notes due june  and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by june  the notes and purchase contracts are separate and distinct instruments  but their terms are structured to simulate a conversion of debt to equity and potentially remarketed debt approximately three years after issuance 
the holders also receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment on the purchase contract at an annual rate of of the commitment amount and are required to pledge their interests in the senior notes to us as collateral on their purchase commitment 
the net proceeds from the equity units offering of approximately billion are being used for general corporate purposes  which to date has primarily included the purchase of siv securities from liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary and repayment of outstanding debt 
during january  we increased our capital base by billion through the sale of convertible senior notes 
the proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes  including the purchase of siv securities from our liquidity funds 
in connection with this financing  we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes 
these hedging transactions had a net cost to us of million  which we paid from the proceeds of the notes 
this transaction closed on january  we used approximately million of the capital raised to purchase and retire preferred stock convertible into million shares of our common stock 
during november  we borrowed an aggregate of million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes 
this facility matures on october   may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions 
on january   we amended the credit agreement to increase the maximum amount that we may borrow from million to billion 
on march   we elected to procure a letter of credit loc to support up to million of certain siv issued holdings in a liquidity fund under this facility 
see discussion on liquidity fund support below 
in march  we repaid million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and amended the credit agreement to decrease the maximum amount that we may borrow from billion to million and further modified covenants  as discussed below 
on december   we completed the acquisition of citigroup s asset management business cam in exchange for i all outstanding stock of our subsidiaries that constituted our private client and capital markets businesses  ii  shares of common stock and shares of our non voting convertible preferred stock  which is convertible  upon transfer  into  shares of common stock  and iii million in cash borrowed under a million five year syndicated term loan facility 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid a post closing purchase price adjustment of million to citigroup in september  based on the retention of certain aum nine months after the closing 
during fiscal and  we issued approximately 
million and million common shares  respectively  upon conversion of approximately 
and shares  respectively  of the convertible preferred stock that was issued in the cam acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased shares convertible into million common shares of the convertible preferred stock for approximately million in cash 

table of contents in october  we borrowed million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the citigroup transaction 
effective with the closing of the citigroup transaction  we entered into a million three year amortizing interest rate swap swap to hedge a portion of the million floating rate term loan at a fixed rate of 
during the march quarter  this swap began to unwind in accordance with its terms and we repaid a corresponding million of the debt 
during fiscal  we repaid million of the debt 
the outstanding balance under this facility was million at march  and the swap fully matured in december also in connection with the citigroup transaction  one of our subsidiaries borrowed million under a day promissory note 
during the fiscal year ended march   we paid from available cash the balance outstanding on this note 
included in outstanding debt as of march  is million principal amount of senior notes due july   which bear interest at 
the notes were issued at a discount to yield 
the accreted balance of million was repaid from available cash in july the agreements entered into as part of our january issuance of billion in convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt  with a few exceptions  if our debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the documents exceeds the may issuance of equity units resulted in our debt to ebitda ratio exceeding that limit  although we received a waiver of the covenant to allow us to complete the transaction 
the waiver prevents us from issuing more than million in additional debt at any time when our debt to ebitda ratio exceeds the sales of siv securities during fiscal year reduced our ebitda under the definition  thus further increasing our ratio for purposes of this covenant 
as a result of these two events  we may not  subject to a few limited exceptions  incur more than million in new indebtedness until the effects of the sales of siv securities is no longer in the trailing twelve month ebitda calculation and when we have substantially reduced our outstanding indebtedness 
our million revolving line of credit  as revised  of which million is currently outstanding  and our million term loan also contain financial covenants 
these covenants include maximum debt to ebitda ratio of and minimum ebitda to interest expense ratio of the maximum debt to ebitda ratio was increased from to in a november amendment 
in march  the maximum debt to ebitda ratio was revised to allow us to reduce includable debt by unrestricted cash in excess of up to million in working capital 
debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money  excluding the debt incurred in the equity units offering and non recourse debt  and under capital leases 
ebitda is defined as consolidated net income plus minus tax expense  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangibles  any extraordinary expenses or losses  any non cash charges and up to billion in realized losses resulting from liquidity fund support 
as of march   legg mason s debt to ebitda ratio was and ebitda to interest expense ratio was  and therefore legg mason is in compliance with these covenants 
if our net income remains at current levels or further declines  or if we spend our available cash  it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants 
if we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure  we may elect to take a number of actions  including reducing our expenses in order to increase our ebitda  use available cash to repay all or a portion of our million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seek to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt 
based on march run rate ebitda  and factoring projected cost savings  we would be required to repay over half of our outstanding bank debt by december to maintain compliance with our covenants 
however  based on improved april run rate results  repayment of debt may not be required to maintain compliance with our covenants 
we anticipate that we will have available cash to repay all or a portion of our bank debt  should it be necessary 
using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above 
entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments 
our outstanding debt is currently rated investment grade by all three rating agencies that follow us moody s investor services moody s  standard and poor s rating services standard and poor s  and fitch ratings 
our current moody s rating is a with a 
table of contents negative outlook 
our current standard and poor s rating is bbb with a negative outlook and our current fitch rating is a with a negative outlook 
in the event of a one level downgrade by moody s or standard and poor s  the interest rate on our five year term loan and revolving line of credit will increase by per annum 
effective november   we acquired of the outstanding equity of permal 
concurrent with the acquisition  permal completed a reorganization in which the residual of outstanding equity was converted to preference shares  resulting in legg mason owning of the outstanding voting common stock of permal 
we have the right to purchase the preference shares over the four years subsequent to the closing and  if that right is not exercised  the holders of those equity interests have the right to require us to purchase the interests in the same general time frame for approximately the same consideration 
the maximum aggregate price  including earnout payments related to each purchase and based upon future revenue levels  for all equity interests in permal is billion excluding acquisition costs and dividends 
during fiscal  payments of million were made to the former owners of permal  representing earnout payments based upon permal s revenues through the second anniversary date and the purchase of of the preference shares  of which million was paid in cash and the balance was in our common stock 
it is anticipated that we will acquire the remaining of the preference shares in fiscal at amounts based on permal s revenues  at which time we may be required to pay up to million under the agreements governing the permal acquisition 
the final payment for this transaction on the sixth anniversary in fiscal will be between million and million based on permal s revenues and the amount of the fiscal payment 
we may elect to deliver up to of each of the future payments in the form of shares of our common stock 
in addition  during fiscal  and  we paid an aggregate amount of approximately million in dividends on the preference shares  and we will pay a minimum of million in dividends on the preference shares in fiscal all payments for preference shares  including dividends  are recognized as additional goodwill 
on august   we purchased pcm for cash of approximately million  excluding acquisition costs 
the transaction included two contingent payments based on pcm s revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing  with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than billion 
during fiscal  we made the maximum third anniversary payment of million to the former owners of pcm 
during fiscal  we paid from available cash into escrow the maximum fifth anniversary payment of million of which million remained in escrow subject to certain limited claw back provisions until july during fiscal  the contingency was settled at which time million was released from escrow to the sellers and million was returned to us and recorded as a reduction of goodwill 
in april  we completed a sale in which citigroup global markets inc  an affiliate of citigroup  acquired a majority of the overlay and implementation business of lmppg  including its managed account trading and technology platform 
the sale produced cash proceeds of approximately million 
in fiscal  the board of directors previously authorized us  at our discretion  to purchase up to million shares of our common stock 
during the june quarter  we repurchased  shares for million 
on july   the board of directors authorized us to repurchase  from time to time  up to million shares of our common stock to replace the previous share repurchase authorization 
in january  the board of directors also authorized us to repurchase non voting convertible preferred stock representing up to million shares of common stock from the proceeds from the convertible senior notes discussed above 
in february  we repurchased and retired preferred stock convertible into million shares of common stock for million 
also  during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million under the new authorization  in addition to the  shares above 
there were no repurchases during fiscal and certain of our asset management subsidiaries maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes

certain subsidiaries are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies 
all such subsidiaries met their respective capital adequacy requirements 

table of contents liquidity fund support during fiscal and  we entered into a series of arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds 
during fiscal  we purchased and subsequently sold  or reimbursed the funds for a portion of their losses incurred in selling  all outstanding securities issued by sivs held in various liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries  the majority of which were previously supported under these arrangements

as part of the loc arrangements  we agreed to reimburse to the banks any amounts that may be drawn on the locs and  to support four of these agreements  we provided approximately million in cash collateral as of march  additionally  one of the arrangements was supported with million in excess capacity on our billion revolving credit facility 
in fiscal  these locs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds  as described below  and million in collateral was returned 
during fiscal  we entered into six capital support agreements csas 
under the terms of the csas  we agreed to provide up to a maximum of million in support to two liquidity funds in certain circumstances upon the funds realizing a loss from specific underlying securities

our four remaining csas to provide an aggregate million of support for investments in non siv securities to certain funds expire on or before march  if the funds continue to hold the underlying securities and market conditions have not improved when the agreements expire  we will likely be required to utilize cash to address our obligations under these support arrangements

we generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements  as defined  other than those described in the contractual obligations and contingent payments section that follows and variable interest entities and liquidity fund support discussed in notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as previously discussed  during fiscal and  we entered into various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds 
these arrangements  most of which were terminated or expired prior to march   included letters of credit  capital support agreements and a trs  which are fully described above and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and contingent payments we have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements 
in addition  as described in liquidity and capital resources above  we have made or expect to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements

these obligations will be funded  as required  through the end of the commitment periods that range through fiscal the table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of million net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated 

table of contents market risk a risk management committee oversees and coordinates risk management activities of legg mason and its subsidiaries 
in addition  certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level 
the following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk 
revenues and net income the majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our aum 
accordingly  a decline in the value of securities will cause our aum to decrease 
in addition  our fixed income and liquidity aum are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations  as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts 
performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks 
declines in market values of aum will result in reduced fee revenues and net income 
we generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets 
declines in market values of aum in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues 
in addition  under revenue sharing agreements  certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs  including compensation 
our net income  profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues  and a change in aum at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary 
trading and non trading assets and liabilities our trading and non trading assets and liabilities are comprised of investment securities  including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products  securities issued by sivs and other conduit investments  derivative instruments  limited partnerships  limited liability companies and certain other investment products 
beginning in november  we entered into a series of arrangements to provide credit support to certain liquidity funds 
these arrangements included locs  csas  a trs arrangement and the purchase of securities issued by sivs and other conduits  all of which substantially increased our exposure to the risk of security price fluctuations 
during fiscal  we purchased and subsequently sold  or the funds sold  all remaining securities issued by sivs held in our liquidity funds  effectively eliminating our exposure 
prior to the purchase  the majority of these siv securities were supported under capital support arrangements  letters of credit and a trs 
the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase 
during fiscal  we also sold canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal as of march   four csas to provide up to a maximum of million in support of net asset values of four funds  with underlying investments in over billion in non asset backed securities  remain outstanding 
during april  one of the csas representing million of the million terminated while incurring no loss

however  it may have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income 
other trading investments of million and million at march  and  respectively  relate to other long term incentive plans and the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions 
therefore  fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense  non operating income and net income 

table of contents approximately million and million of trading assets at march  and  respectively  are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income 
of these amounts  the fluctuations in market value of approximately million and million of proprietary fund products as of march  and  respectively  have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements and the fluctuations in market value of approximately million as of march  is related to minority interest of consolidated investment funds 
investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record  has other investors  or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy

after the termination of one of the fund support arrangements in april for million  our current exposure and additional potential losses on supported securities are million and million  respectively 
valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within critical accounting policies under the heading valuation of financial instruments 
the elimination of siv exposure from our balance sheet and money market funds as of march  substantially reduced the sensitivity of our financial position to market risk

table of contents the following is a summary of the effect of a increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at march  carrying value fair value assuming a increase fair value assuming a decrease trading investments investment related to deferred compensation plans proprietary fund products and other total trading investment available for sale investments investments in partnerships and llcs other investments total investments subject to market risk derivative liabilities fund support arrangements gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability  or minority interest 
as a result  a increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings  respectively  as of march  foreign exchange sensitivity we operate primarily in the united states  but provide services  earn revenues and incur expenses outside the united states 
accordingly  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies  principally in brazil  the united kingdom  poland  australia  and japan  may impact our comprehensive income and net income 
certain of our subsidiaries have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations 
we do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our comprehensive income or net income or liquidity 
interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates 
at march  and  approximately million and  million  respectively  of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income 
as of march   we estimate that a change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding debt 
critical accounting policies accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
understanding these policies  therefore  is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information 
certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
therefore  actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments 
revenue recognition the vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our aum 
the underlying securities within the portfolios we manage  which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements  are generally valued as follows i with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available  the market 
table of contents value of such securities  and ii with respect to other securities and assets  fair value as determined in good faith 
for most of our mutual funds and other pooled products  the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities 
each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which  in turn  may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services  the fund accounting agent  the fund manager  broker dealers  and others or a combination thereof 
the funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate 
management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition 
as manager and advisor for separate accounts  we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts or may share this responsibility with others and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition 
management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account aum 
separate account customers typically select the custodian 
valuation processes for aum are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients 
equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade 
debt securities under management are usually valued at bid  or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices  provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations  quotations from bond dealers  market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities 
short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost  which is designed to approximate fair value 
the vast majority of our aum is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services  fund accounting agents  custodians and brokers 
this varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class equity  fixed income and liquidity as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class 
regardless of the valuation process or pricing source  we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided 
where market prices are not readily available  or are determined not to reflect fair value  value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on  among other things  unobservable inputs 
management fees on aum where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material 
as of march   equity  fixed income and liquidity aum values aggregated billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
as the vast majority of our aum is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs  we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our aum 
the recent economic events and financial market declines have increased market price volatility  however  the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations 
as of march   less than of total aum is valued based on unobservable inputs 
valuation of financial instruments substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  except long term debt 
trading investments  investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets include forms of financial instruments 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income  depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
for investments  we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations  when available 
fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices 
we evaluate our non trading investment securities for other than temporary impairment 
impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time 
if an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist  the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined 

table of contents in fiscal and  we entered into various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualify as derivative transactions 
the fair values of these derivative instruments are based on management s estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses 
during fiscal  we purchased and subsequently sold all supported securities issued by sivs held in our liquidity funds  effectively eliminating our exposure to sivs  and the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase 
as of march   four capital support arrangements  which support investments in non asset backed securities  remained outstanding for which a derivative liability of million was included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
no derivative asset was recorded as of march  as of march   we had million of derivative assets included in other current assets and million of derivative liabilities included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
exposure on these derivative instruments was based on the underlying securities values and related gains and losses may vary significantly in relation to their recorded balances 
none of these derivative transactions were designated for hedge accounting as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and the related gains and losses are included in fund support in the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal and for trading and non trading investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources  including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry 
as of march  and  we owned approximately million and million  respectively  of trading and non trading financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs 
at march  and  we also have approximately million and million  respectively  of other investments  such as investment partnerships  that are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are generally accounted for under the cost or equity method 
effective april   we adopted statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and increases disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
under sfas  a fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  and the risk of non performance 
sfas establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories level financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets  which  for us  include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets 
level financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets  or prices are based on observable inputs  other than quoted prices  such as models or other valuation methodologies 
for us  this category may include repurchase agreements  fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products 
level financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs  including those for which there is little or no market activity 
this category includes derivative assets and liabilities related to fund support arrangements and investments in partnerships  limited liability companies  and private equity funds 
this category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions 

table of contents the valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
proprietary fund products are valued at net asset value nav determined by the fund administrator 
these funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices 
their valuations may be classified as level  level or level based on whether the fund is exchange traded  the frequency of the related nav determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities private equity and investment partnerships for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available  management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources  including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value 
these valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require management s judgment and are therefore classified in level our liquidity fund support has taken the form of csas  locs  a trs arrangement and purchases of securities from funds as more fully described in note the csas  locs  and trs arrangement are considered derivative assets or liabilities for accounting purposes representing the company s rights and obligations under the support  the fair value of which is based principally on the value of the underlying securities 
substantially all of the underlying securities supported and all of the securities purchased from liquidity funds were issued by sivs and had no active market such that fair value was determined based on an evaluation of the issuer trust and its underlying collateral  which are primarily comprised of asset and mortgage backed securities  corporate bonds  and collateralized debt obligations 
these instruments may or may not have financial guaranty insurance 
of the total siv securities we owned or supported in liquidity funds prior to the sale of siv securities  over of the underlying trust collateral securities were valued based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data  over of the collateral securities were valued based on spreads to benchmark debt instruments with available prices  and less than of the collateral values were based on broker quotes 
all security prices  including prices for underlying trust collateral securities  whether direct market quotes  adjusted comparable security prices  or broker quotes  are subject to internal analyses that consider market observations  broker quotes and other tests to substantiate their fair values 
broker quotes used are indicative but not firm or tradable bids 
exclusive of these internal analytics  we generally do not obtain more than one price per instrument  unless we are relying on broker quotes  where we generally seek to use an average of at least two quotes 
the prices utilized for underlying trust collateral securities incorporated both non performance and liquidity risks inherent in these securities and there were no further considerations of credit risk necessary relating to the trust or the issuers of the sivs 
in estimating the fair values for siv related financial assets and liabilities both securities owned and fund support derivatives we assumed the value of the related siv security equaled its percentage share of the sum of the values of the underlying collateral securities plus cash and other assets held by the trust  net of reported trust liabilities 
in following this valuation approach  we assume that the siv trust will distribute to holders all income and other returns received from the collateral securities 
when no direct price for a particular collateral security is available  the price is based upon a review of available information  including prices for securities we believe are comparable 
we use professional judgment to consider adjustments where appropriate including  for example  based on the nature of the collateral and its issue date 
while these determinations may reflect  in whole or part  market observations  they are inherently subjective and it is not possible to further quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
our credit risk is not a material factor to the fair value of the related derivative liabilities because  among other things  the majority of our liquidity fund support required cash collateral and we had available cash to cover uncollateralized positions 
these valuation processes for supported or purchased siv issued securities inherently required management s judgment and therefore the related assets and liabilities were classified in level market changes affecting the underlying collateral are a primary contributor to changes in the fair values of the liquidity fund support assets and liabilities and the related gains and losses 
as of march   approximately of total assets and less than of total liabilities meet the definition of level any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents intangible assets and goodwill balances as of march  are as follows americas international total asset management contracts indefinite life intangible assets trade names goodwill our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts  contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions 
asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract 
contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost 
similarly  trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 
in allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired 
we determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows  which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins  growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience  estimated contract lives  discount rates  projected net client flows and market performance 
the determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed 
the discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below 
for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill  we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation depreciation on cash flows for the near term generally the first five years based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions  our past experience  relevant publicly available statistics and projections  and discussions with our own market experts 
beyond five years  our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics 
we believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs  including internal and external sources described above 
however  there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets  and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions 
goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities 
given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements  on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values 
triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business  legal or regulatory environment  loss of key personnel  significant business dispositions  or other events 
if a triggering event has occurred  we perform detail tests  which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions  to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired 
at a minimum  we perform these detail tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at december amortizable intangible assets intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts 
projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current aum for the applicable contracts 
contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset 
the remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates 
if the amortization periods are not 
table of contents appropriate  the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
management contract intangible assets related to retail separately managed accounts sold through broker dealer sponsored programs acquired in the cam transaction cam management contracts represented approximately million or of our total net amortizable intangible assets as of december   with a remaining life of approximately years 
however  we have experienced a recent trend of increased client outflows associated with these contracts 
in addition  changes at the primary underlying program sponsor announced during the march quarter are expected to contribute further to this trend 
the combination of these events has caused us to reduce the remaining expected life by approximately to years 
the impact of reduced aum levels  combined with the shorter expected life recovery period  has resulted in our cumulative expected future cash flows to fall below the carrying value of the asset 
on a discounted cash flow basis  this resulted in an impairment charge of million 
after the impairment charge  the cam management contracts represent approximately million or of our total net amortizable intangible assets 
as a result of significant client attrition  related declines in aum and the associated revised estimate of remaining useful lives  our evaluation during fiscal of pcm s asset management contracts indicated the carrying value would not be fully recoverable 
based upon projected cash flows on remaining acquired contracts  discounted at a rate of  the value of contracts was determined to be impaired and we recognized charges for the remaining book value totaling million in fiscal current cash flow projections were significantly lower than previous projections as a result of continued aum outflows and decreased market value resulting in part from the recent severe market declines 
the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from to years with a weighted average life of approximately years 
indefinite life intangible assets for intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite  fair value is determined based on projected discounted cash flows 
we have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets proprietary fund contracts and to a lesser extent  trade names 
the discounted projected cash flows used to value intangible assets take into consideration estimates of profit margins  growth rates  which includes estimates of both aum flows and market expectations by asset class equity  fixed income and liquidity  and discount rates 
an asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset 
if such impairment exists  the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary 
projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward years  assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance 
contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit  such as contracts within the same family of funds  are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions 
similarly  cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
the domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the cam acquisition of  million and the permal funds of hedge funds contracts of million account for approximately and  respectively  of our indefinite life intangible assets 
as a result of the dramatic changes in market conditions during the fiscal year  we revised our growth assumptions downward  to project contraction to minimal growth for the domestic mutual fund contracts and contraction for the permal contracts through the next two years 
cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately  with a long term annual rate of approximately thereafter 
cash flows on the permal contracts were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately  with a long term annual rate of approximately thereafter 
we believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs  
table of contents including internal and external sources described above 
however  there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets  and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions 
the projected cash flows from the domestic mutual funds and permal funds are discounted at and  respectively 
changes in assumptions  such as an increased discount rate or declining cash flows  could result in impairment 
assuming all other factors remain the same  actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and permal fund of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than and  respectively  from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to and  respectively  for the assets to be deemed impaired 
with continued deterioration in the markets or other unfavorable factors  it is reasonably possible that actual cash flows from either or both the domestic mutual fund or permal fund contracts could deviate from projections by more than and  respectively 
the approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by million and million  respectively 
trade names account for less than of indefinite life intangible assets 
the significant decrease in pcm s assets under management and related cash flows generated assessed values that resulted in full impairment of the million pcm trade name asset during fiscal the assessment of this trade name fair value was based on a discounted cash flow model applying an after tax royalty rate to pcm s expected future revenues  using a discount rate of and long term annual growth of 
although the discounted cash flow model resulted in an immaterial assessed value  based on other qualitative factors  we believed the remaining amount was impaired 
goodwill goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
in estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit  we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows  similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
allocations of goodwill to our divisions for changes in our management structure  acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions 
significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit  including profit margins  expected current and long term cash flow growth rates  and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows 
cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both aum flows and market expectations by asset class equity  fixed income and liquidity  by investment manager and by reporting unit based upon  among other things  historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources 
the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation depreciation on cash flows are projected for the near term generally the first five years based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions  our experience  relevant publicly available statistics and projections  and discussions with our own market experts 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital 
we estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates 
we estimate the cost of capital based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the risk free interest rate  market risk and size premiums  peer group betas and unsystematic risk 
the discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values 
goodwill in the americas reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of cam and royce 
the value of this reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our us mutual funds  closed end funds and other proprietary funds  in addition to separate account assets of our us managers 
goodwill in the international reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of permal and the international cam businesses 
the projected cash flows are discounted at and  respectively  for the americas and international divisions to determine the present value of cash flows 
as of march   the implied fair values exceed the carrying values for both the americas and international divisions 
projected cash flows  on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the americas division  are assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately  with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 
projected cash 
table of contents flows  on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the international division are assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately  with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 
cash flow growth of and for americas and international  respectively  over the next five years is based on separate factors for equity  fixed income  and liquidity products 
equity product growth projections are based on historical recovery trends following prior recessionary periods  in context with our long term growth experience and current market conditions 
fixed income product growth projections are based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager and current market influences relevant to their business 
on a combined basis for both equity and fixed income product types  these projections rely on an expectation that markets relevant to these products will stabilize with some rebalancing from fixed income to equity products during fiscal long term growth of for both divisions is based on our historical experience and available historic market statistics 
we believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs  including internal and external sources described above 
however  there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets  and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions 
assuming all other factors remain the same  actual results and changes in assumptions for the americas and international reporting units would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than and  respectively  from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately and percentage points  respectively  for goodwill to be considered for impairment 
under our prior management structure and related reporting units of managed investments  institutional and wealth management  we recognized an impairment charge of  for the wealth management division during the third quarter of fiscal the severe market turmoil experienced during the december quarter had a more significant impact on the wealth management division than on our other divisions 
aum in that division decreased over as a result of both net client outflows and market depreciation 
as a result of the dramatic changes in market conditions during the december quarter  growth assumptions were revised downward  to project contraction through the next two years 
further  the applicable discount rate was increased from to based on changes in interest rates and market risk factors 
the combined impact of these factors decreased projected cash flows of the wealth management division by over from our prior projections resulting in the impairment charge 
prior to the impairment charge  the majority of the goodwill of this division arose from the acquisition of pcm 
projected cash flows for the wealth management division were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately  with a long term annual growth rate of approximately compared to prior average growth rates of and  respectively 
growth of over the next five years was based on the current market conditions  our past experience  market statistics and prospects of each of our more significant managers in this division 
these projections relied on the expectation that markets relevant to products in this division will stabilize by fiscal actual results will invariably differ from our assumptions  the impact of which could be material to the financial statements 
goodwill is the residual value of a reporting unit after all other identifiable assets in that reporting unit have been valued  including management contract intangible assets 
if goodwill has been determined to be impaired  variances in assumptions that impact the value of the reporting unit will generally also impact the values of identifiable assets within the reporting unit before  and to a greater extent than  they impact goodwill 
for example  if our growth assumptions for the wealth management division and all its related intangible assets were decreased for all periods by  the goodwill impairment charge recorded for the division would have increased by less than  because the other intangible assets within the division would have correspondingly decreased in value 
likewise  if the discount rate for the wealth management division and all its related intangible assets had been percentage point higher  the goodwill impairment charge recorded for the division would have increased by less than 
as indicated above  we performed our annual assessment of goodwill as of december however  given the restructuring of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reassessed the fair values of our former reporting units as of march   the results of which indicated the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value 
as of march   considering relevant prices of legg mason s common shares and based on dilutive shares outstanding  inclusive of shares issuable under equity units  our market capitalization  along with a reasonable control premium  approximates its carrying value 
in an 
table of contents acquisition  there is typically a premium paid over current market prices of publicly traded companies that relates to the ability to control the operations of an acquired company 
recent market evidence regarding this control factor suggests premiums of to and higher as realistic and common  and legg mason believes such premiums to be a reasonable estimation for our equity value 
our market evidence is from a published source and included transactions from the quarter ended september  although there is limited transaction data subsequent to september   more recent transactions support or exceed the high end of our range 
we exclude consideration of transactions with unique circumstances and find that transaction values for asset management firms relative to their respective book values do not vary significantly from relative transaction values in other industries 
continued disruption and depressed financial markets will further increase the potential for impairment of our goodwill and or other intangible asset carrying values 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation plans include stock options  employee stock purchase plans  performance share awards  restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock 
under our stock compensation plans  we issue equity awards to officers and key employees 
during fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment and related pronouncements using the modified prospective method and the related transition election 
under this method  compensation expense for the years ended march   and includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method 
unamortized deferred compensation is recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
also under sfas no 
r  cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows 
we granted million  million  and million stock options  including grants to non employee directors  in fiscal  and  respectively 
for additional information on share based compensation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of each option grant using the black scholes option pricing model  except for market based grants  for which we use a monte carlo option pricing model 
both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables 
the inputs for the black scholes model include stock price on the date of grant  exercise price of the option  dividend yield  volatility  expected life and the risk free interest rate  all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions 
we calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options 
we estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and in part upon the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant 
the expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled  based upon our historical option exercise experience 
the risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued 
if we used different methods to estimate our variables for the black scholes and monte carlo models  or if we used a different type of option pricing model  the fair value of our option grants might be different 
income taxes legg mason and its subsidiaries are subject to the income tax laws of the federal  state and local jurisdictions of the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction 
due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions  we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes 
management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized  then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision 

table of contents substantially all of legg mason s deferred tax assets relate to us and united kingdom uk taxing jurisdictions 
although legg mason has been historically profitable  the current year siv losses resulted in a us tax loss for fiscal we believe siv losses incurred on liquidity fund guarantees are unique and isolated 
therefore  any analysis of legg mason s core us earnings expected to recur in the future should exclude incurred siv losses 
as of march   us deferred tax assets accumulated billion  realization of which is expected to require billion of future us earnings 
based on estimates of future taxable income  using the same assumptions as those used in our goodwill impairment testing  it is more likely than not that current tax benefits are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time 
to the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities  we have considered the timing  nature and jurisdiction of reversals 
while tax planning may enhance our positions  the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies 
as of march   uk deferred tax assets are not material
