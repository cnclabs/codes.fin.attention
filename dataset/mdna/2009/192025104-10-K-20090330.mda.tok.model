in november  peoplesbank opened its th full service financial center 
located in bel air  maryland  this new office follows the bank s earlier expansion during into the hunt valley  maryland and hanover  pennsylvania markets 
coincident with physical expansion  the corporation recruited several experienced business bankers  which enhanced its business banking reputation 
asset growth achieved a new record in as total assets increased million or percent above the level of year end in light of strong balance sheet growth  which caused capital ratios to trend down  the corporation applied for million in capital under the us department of the treasury s capital purchase program cpp 
the million capital request was approved by the treasury in december  and the corporation received the funds in january as described in the shareholders equity and capital adequacy section of this report 
the cpp capital injection enables the corporation to proceed on its planned growth path 
earnings for the corporation were negatively impacted by the economic forces that have affected the entire financial services industry

table of contents financial highlights the corporation earned  or per share diluted for  compared to  or per share diluted for  and  or per share diluted for the  or percent decrease in earnings for was primarily the result of a  pre tax  after tax increase in provision for loan losses 
the current period provision was primarily increased to support strong loan growth in the corporation s business loan portfolio and to account for increased risk associated with the ongoing economic recession 
in contrast  during the corporation recognized the positive financial impact of a one time  pre tax recovery  after tax of loan losses that were incurred by peoplesbank during due to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in  the full amount of the recovery was recorded as a reduction to the loan loss provision at that time 
on a comparable basis  net income for decreased  or percent below  as adjusted  reported earnings less  for the after tax effect of the loan loss recovery 
net income for the period was also constrained by net interest margin compression as yields on earning assets declined more rapidly than rates paid on deposits due in part to aggressive interest rate cuts by the federal reserve bank to stimulate the struggling us economy

during  peoplesbank opened three full service financial centers 
at year end  total assets were million  an increase of approximately million  or percent  above year end asset growth occurred primarily in the business loan portfolio and secondarily in the home equity loan portfolio 
asset growth was funded by deposit growth  principally time deposits  and to a lesser degree overnight borrowings 
comparatively  the corporation earned  in  a  or percent increase above the increase was primarily attributable to a  or percent increase in net interest income and a  decrease in loan loss provision  which more than offset a  or percent increase in noninterest expense 
the increase in net interest income reflected an increase in interest income from a larger volume of earning assets  principally business and home equity loans  and investment securities 
the  or percent increase in business loan fees for also contributed to the increase in net interest income 
approximately   after tax of the increase in fees came from selected business loan accounts  including a recovery of fees from a large delinquent account  which was unusually large as to amount 
the net interest margin tax equivalent basis  which was favorably impacted by the increase in loan fees  was percent for  the same as the significant decrease in the loan loss provision reflected the favorable impact of the onetime   after tax recovery of loan losses described earlier 
the increase in noninterest expense was due in part to increased personnel costs  including staff additions associated with planned business growth  and increases in performance based compensation and benefits costs 
the recognition of a   after tax prepayment penalty on the early pay off of a million federal home loan bank advance also contributed to the increase in noninterest expense 
the advance was due july and had an above market interest rate of percent 
the corporation paid off the advance to reduce interest expense in future periods 
at year end  total assets were million  an increase of approximately million  or percent  above year end annual cash dividends per share  as adjusted  totaled

through its evaluation of probable loan losses and the current loan portfolio  management believes that the allowance is adequate to support losses inherent in the portfolio at december  throughout  the corporation maintained a capital level above minimum regulatory quantitative requirements 
currently  there are three federal regulatory definitions of capital that take the form of minimum ratios

income statement analysis net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investment securities  and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds

in spite of decreasing short term market interest rates during  short term cd rates remained relatively high as a result of competitive pricing pressures

the cost of servicing long term corporate debt declined percent in  compared to the preceding year due to a decrease in volume 
the corporation paid off approximately million in above market rate corporate debt in  however  the effect of this reduction in debt was offset by the full years impact of adding million in trust preferred debt in june as a capital strategy to support planned balance sheet growth

the purpose of the wholesale leverage strategy is to reduce the cost of the recent preferred stock issuance under the us department of the treasury s capital purchase plan described more fully below in the shareholders equity and capital adequacy section 
shareholders equity and capital adequacy shareholders equity or capital enables the corporation to maintain asset growth and absorb losses 
capital adequacy can be negatively affected by a multitude of factors  including corporate expansion  balance sheet growth  losses  dividend policy  and regulatory mandates  among others

risk management the corporation s risk management committee committee meets at least quarterly and includes members of senior management and an independent director 
the objective of the committee is to identify and manage risk inherent in the operations of the corporation and its affiliates 
while the committee s risk review is broad in scope  its primary responsibility is to develop  implement and monitor compliance with formal risk management policies and procedures 
credit risk management the corporation emphasizes the management of credit risk 
to support this objective a sound lending policy framework has been established 
this framework includes seven basic policies that guide the lending process and minimize risk 
first  the corporation follows detailed written lending policies and procedures 
second  lending authority is granted commensurate with dollar amount  loan type  level of risk  and loan officer experience 
third  loan review committees function at both the senior lending officer level and the board level to review and approve loans that exceed preestablished dollar thresholds and or meet other criteria 
fourth  the corporation lends mainly within its primary geographical market area  york county  pennsylvania and northern maryland 
although this focus may pose a geographical concentration risk  the diverse local economy and employee knowledge of customers minimizes this risk 
fifth  the loan portfolio is diversified to prevent dependency upon a single customer or small group of related customers 
sixth  the corporation does not participate in the subprime lending market  nor does it invest in securities backed by subprime mortgages 
and seventh  the corporation does not lend to foreign countries or persons residing therein 
in addition to a comprehensive lending policy  numerous internal reviews of loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios occur throughout the year 
in addition to management s reviews in connection with its internal control  loan portfolios are reviewed by independent auditors in connection with their annual financial statement audit and are examined periodically by bank regulators 

table of contents one component of the internal credit risk review is the identification and management of industry concentrations  defined as greater than percent of the total loan portfolio 
at year end  the corporation had two industry concentrations that exceeded percent of the total loan portfolio real estate construction and land development was percent  and commercial real estate leasing was percent 
commercial leasing involves borrowers who lease real estate to commercial tenants 
loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized with real estate 
comparatively  at year end  two industry concentrations exceeded percent of the total loan portfolio real estate construction and land development was percent  and commercial real estate leasing was percent 
nonperforming assets the following table presents asset categories posing the greatest risk of loss 
management generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest income when loan payment performance is unsatisfactory and the loan is past due days or more 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  are contractually past due  but well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the final category  foreclosed real estate  is real estate acquired to satisfy debts owed to peoplesbank 
table also provides a summary of nonperforming assets and related ratios 
the paragraphs below explain significant changes in the aforementioned categories for december   compared to december  table nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest foreclosed real estate  net of allowance total nonperforming assets ratios nonaccrual loans as a of total year end loans nonperforming assets as a of total year end loans and net foreclosed real estate nonperforming assets as a of total year end stockholders equity allowance for loan losses as a multiple of nonaccrual loans x x x x x on december   nonaccrual loans consisted of collateralized business and mortgage loans  and consumer loans 
the corporation recognizes interest income on a cash basis for nonaccrual loans 
on december   the nonaccrual loan portfolio balance totaled  a  decrease compared to december  the decrease resulted from the net effect of removing one relatively large nonaccrual business loan from the portfolio and adding several smaller unrelated nonaccrual business loans 
during the current period  a  nonaccrual business loan was restored to accrual 
table of contents status 
the loan was brought current by the borrower  and an escrow was established with the borrower s funds to keep it current 
management believes that the real estate supporting this loan is situated in a prime location for residential development and expects to ultimately recover all amounts due 
during  several business loans were added to the nonaccrual loan portfolio  including a business loan totaling  on june   the company filed a form k disclosing that management anticipated a loss provision and corresponding charge off ranging from  to  on this account pending a final appraisal of the real estate collateral 
upon receipt of the appraisal later in june  management charged off  against the allowance and recorded a provision expense for the same amount 
the remaining unpaid principal loan balance of  which represented the fair value of the real estate less estimated selling costs  was reclassified to foreclosed real estate 
on december   the nonaccrual loan portfolio was comprised of unrelated accounts ranging in size from  to  the largest account  totaling  is adequately collaterized by real estate  which the borrower is trying to liquidate 
management has established a loss allowance for selected accounts where the net realizable value of the collateral is insufficient to repay the loan 
management and the board of directors evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly 
collection efforts  including modification of contractual terms for individual accounts based on prevailing market conditions and liquidation of collateral assets  are being employed to maximize recovery 
in the first quarter of  information came to management s attention that resulted in the reclassification of a million commercial real estate loan from performing to nonaccrual status 
management is in the process of pursuing its remedies against the borrowers and guarantors  and has ordered a new appraisal on the collateral securing the loan to assist management in evaluating its fair value 
once management completes its impairment analysis  the reserve established  if any  may negatively impact earnings for for  the gross interest income that would have been recorded if the nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and current throughout the period was approximately  the amount of interest income on those nonaccrual loans that was included in net income for was approximately  the interest income recognized on impaired loans  which includes nonaccrual loans  in note impaired  nonaccrual and past due loans is a lesser amount because it includes interest income only from the time the loan was impaired 
on december   foreclosed real estate  net of allowance  totaled  compared to  on december  the current portfolio  which is included in the other assets category  contains two unrelated properties 
the first property  previously discussed within the nonaccrual loans narrative  is an unoccupied nine unit condominium building with a carrying value of   initial amount plus  of capital improvements 
the property is being held in a subsidiary of the corporation pending eventual sale of the individual units 
the second property  which management is trying to liquidate  has a carrying value of  there was no valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate as there were no declines in the fair value of individual assets for  and on december   there were approximately million in potential problem loans closely monitored by management 
potential problem loans consist of loans for which management has doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms  and which are not disclosed in table a loss allowance is established for those potential problem loans that  in management s judgment  were inadequately collateralized 
comparatively  management was monitoring approximately million in potential problem loans on december  
table of contents allowance for loan losses although the corporation maintains sound credit policies  certain loans deteriorate and must be charged off as losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio at december  the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
the allowance is based upon management s continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio coupled with a formal review of adequacy on a quarterly basis  which is subject to review and approval by the board 
in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance  management considers the results of internal and external credit reviews  past loss experience  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  adequacy of collateral  general economic conditions and the local business outlook 
all of these factors are susceptible to significant change 
determining the level of the allowance for probable loan losses at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which are often subjective and fluid 
table presents an analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses over a five year period 
table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan category 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses represents our consideration of qualitative factors  with probable losses inherent in the portfolio that are not fully captured in the allocated allowance analyses  such as industry concentrations  imprecision in the loan risk evaluation process and current economic factors 
the allowance was  or 
percent of total loans  on december   compared to  and 
percent  respectively  on december  the current period allowance was based on management s estimate of the amount necessary to bring the allowance to a level reflective of the risk in the loan portfolio and loan growth 
management considered macro economic factors that could adversely affect the ability of peoplesbank s loan clients to repay their loans  including a general economic slowdown or recession  increases in food and energy costs  rising unemployment and continued downturn in the real estate market 
the corporation does not participate in the subprime lending market and accordingly  it has no loss exposure to subprime lending 
based on its evaluation of probable loan losses in the current portfolio  management believes that the allowance is adequate to support losses inherent in the loan portfolio on december  the  recovery in of prior period commercial loan losses was discussed in the provision for loan loss section of this report

furthermore  the portion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount available for future losses that might occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire loan portfolio 
liquidity maintaining adequate liquidity provides the corporation with the ability to meet financial obligations to depositors  loan customers  employees  and shareholders on a timely and cost effective basis in the normal course of business 
additionally  it provides funds for growth and business opportunities as they arise 
liquidity is generated from transactions relating to both the corporation s assets and liabilities 
the primary sources of asset liquidity are scheduled investment security maturities and cash inflows  funds received from customer loan payments  and asset sales 
the primary sources of liability liquidity are deposit growth  short term borrowings and long term debt 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present the changes in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
for  management believes that liquidity was adequate based on the potential liquidation of a million portfolio of available for sale securities  valued at december   and available credit from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
on december   available net funding from the fhlbp was approximately million 
the corporation s loan to deposit ratio was percent for year end  compared to percent for year end the increase in the ratio was the result of loan growth outpacing deposit growth 
off balance sheet arrangements the corporation s financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
these commitments consist primarily of commitments to grant new loans  unfunded commitments under existing loan facilities  and letters of credit made under the same standards as on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are disclosed in note commitments to extend credit of this report and totaled million at december   compared to million at december  normally these commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and are for specific purposes 

table of contents accordingly  many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn and therefore  generally do not present significant liquidity risk to the corporation or peoplesbank 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation may impact the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation may also significantly affect noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
the level of inflation can be measured by the change in the consumer price index cpi for all urban consumers december vs 
december 
the change in the cpi for was percent  compared to percent for and percent for management believes that the most significant impact on financial results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in market interest rates 
as discussed below in the market risk management section  management strives to structure the balance sheet to increase net interest income by managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice in response to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  management is focused on increasing fee income  an income component that is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable to smaller reporting companies
