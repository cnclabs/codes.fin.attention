item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we were founded in and have grown to be the largest manufacturer of recreation vehicles rvs and a major manufacturer of commercial buses in north america 
our market share in the travel trailer and fifth wheel segment of the industry towables is approximately 
in the motorized segment of the industry we have a market share of approximately 
our market share in small and mid size buses is approximately 
we also manufacture and sell foot buses at our facility in southern california 
our growth has been internal and by acquisition 
our strategy has been to increase our profitability in north america in the rv industry and in the bus business through product innovation  service to our customers  manufacturing quality products  improving our facilities and acquisitions 
we have not entered unrelated businesses and have no plans to do so in the future 
we rely on internally generated cash flows from operations to finance our growth although we may borrow to make an acquisition if we believe the incremental cash flows will provide for rapid payback 
capital expenditures of approximately  in fiscal were made primarily to upgrade it systems and replace machinery and equipment used in the ordinary course of business 
our business model includes decentralized operating units and we compensate operating management primarily with cash based upon profitability of the business unit which they manage 
our corporate staff provides financial management  purchasing services  insurance  legal and human resources  risk management and internal audit functions 
senior corporate management interacts regularly with operating management to assure that corporate objectives are understood clearly and are monitored appropriately 
our rv products are sold to dealers who  in turn  retail those products 
our buses are sold through dealers to municipalities and private purchasers such as rental car companies and hotels 
we generally do not directly finance dealers but do provide repurchase agreements in order to facilitate the dealers obtaining floor plan financing 
trends and business outlook industry conditions in the rv market have been adversely affected by low consumer confidence  tighter lending practices and the general economic downturn 
as a result of these continuing concerns  market conditions continue to be soft and we anticipate this weakness may continue in fiscal the motorized market has been significantly impacted by current market conditions 
the tightening of the retail credit markets  low consumer confidence and the volatility of fuel prices are continuing to place pressure on retail sales and our dealers continue to be cautious in the amount of inventory they are willing to carry 
based on the foregoing and with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment of  in the third quarter of fiscal for the goodwill associated with an operating subsidiary within our motorized segment 
the company also completed an impairment review in the second quarter which resulted in a non cash trademark impairment charge of for the trademark associated with an operating subsidiary in our motorized segment 
the impairments result from the difficult market environment and outlook for the motorhome business 
for fiscal  net sales in our motorized segment decreased compared to fiscal our towables market has been significantly impacted as well  albeit less than our motorized market  as the price of a towable recreation vehicle is generally about one fourth that of a motorhome and sales of more expensive recreation vehicles have suffered greater in the current economic downturn 
dealers continue to sell older model year units before replacing them with new products 
the decline in wholesale demand has directly impacted our gross margins as we have had to increase our discounts to meet competitive pricing 
the company has reacted to the difficult business environment by scaling back its activities and reducing its workforce 
if the current market environment persists  we may have to take additional cost cutting measures including idling additional plants  if necessary 
when consumer confidence stabilizes and retail and wholesale credit availability improves  we expect to see a rebound in sales from dealers ordering units for stock and expect to benefit from our ability to ramp up production in an industry with fewer manufacturing facilities than before  due to competitor failures or plant consolidations 
a short term positive indicator for us is reflected in our order backlog  which has increased from  at july  to  at july   an increase of  or 
a longer term positive outlook for the recreation vehicle industry is supported by favorable demographics as baby boomers reach the age brackets that historically have accounted for the bulk of retail rv sales  and an increase in interest has occurred in the rv lifestyle among both older and younger segments of the population than have traditionally participated 

table of contents we believe an important determinant of demand for recreation vehicles is demographics 
the baby boomer population is now reaching retirement age and retirees are a large market for our products 
the baby boomer retiree population in the united states is expected to grow five times as fast as the total united states population 
we believe a primary indicator of the strength of the recreation vehicle industry is retail rv sales  which we closely monitor to determine industry trends 
recently  although the entire rv industry has been weak  the towable segment of the rv industry has been stronger than the motorized segment 
for the towable segment  retail sales as reported by statistical surveys  inc were down approximately for the seven months ended july  compared with the same period last year 
the motorized segment was down approximately 
tighter retail credit and lower consumer confidence appear to affect the motorized segment more severely 
economic or industry wide factors affecting our recreation vehicle business include raw material costs of commodities used in the manufacture of our product 
material cost is the primary factor determining our cost of products sold 
material costs have generally been flat in future increases in raw material costs would impact our profit margins negatively if we were unable to raise prices for our products by corresponding amounts 
government entities are the primary users of our buses 
demand in this segment is subject to fluctuations in government spending on transit 
in addition  hotel and rental car companies are also major users of our small and mid size buses and therefore travel is an important indicator for this market 
the majority of our buses have a year useful life and are being continuously replaced by operators 
according to the mid size bus manufacturers association  unit sales of small and mid sized buses are down for the six months ended june  compared with the same period last year 
bus sales may benefit from the us government s emphasis on mass transportation in the american reinvestment and recovery act stimulus package 
we do not expect the current condition of the us auto industry  including the recent bankruptcy filings and reorganizations of general motors and chrysler  to have a significant impact on our supply of chassis 
supply of chassis is adequate for now and we believe that on hand inventory would compensate for changes in supply schedules if they occur 
to date  we have not noticed any unusual cost increases from our chassis suppliers 
if the condition of the us auto industry significantly worsens  this could result in supply interruptions and a decrease in our sales and earnings while we obtain replacement chassis from other sources

financial condition and liquidity as of july   we had  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to  on july  this increase was primarily due to a reclassification of auction rate securities ars held at ubs from long term investments to short term investments 
reference is made to note b to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for a description of developments related to our investments in ars 
working capital of  at july  compared to  at july  we have no long term debt 
the company had a  unsecured revolving line of credit which bore interest at prime less and expired on november  the company decided not to renew the unsecured revolving line of credit and allowed it to expire on november  the decision not to renew the line of credit was based on our strong cash position combined with the expectation that we will have the ability to borrow at favorable rates against our ars  if needed 
as a result  we did not anticipate utilizing the line of credit and did not want to incur the cost of maintaining it 
we believe that internally generated funds will be sufficient to meet our current needs and any additional capital requirements 
capital expenditures of approximately  for fiscal year ended july  were primarily to upgrade it systems and replace machinery and equipment used in the ordinary course of business 
of this amount   was for our recreation vehicle facilities and was for our bus operations 
the company anticipates capital expenditures in fiscal of approximately  which is expected to be financed from cash and cash equivalents 
these expenditures will be made primarily for expanding our recreation vehicle facilities and replacing and upgrading machinery  equipment and other assets to be used in the ordinary course of business

the remaining decrease was due to decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to lower spending levels partially offset by a decrease in inventories and receivables due to decreased revenues 
critical accounting principles our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that of our accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and long lived assets at least annually we review the carrying value of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives 
long lived assets  identifiable intangibles that are amortized  goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or 
table of contents changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
this review is performed primarily using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair values could affect the evaluations 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for workers compensation and group medical insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred  including those incurred but not reported 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined by the company with the assistance of a third party administrator and actuary using various state statutes and historical claims experience 
group medical reserves are estimated using historical claims experience 
we have a self insured retention sir for products liability and personal injury matters of  per occurrence 
we have established a reserve on our balance sheet for such occurrences based on historical data and actuarial information 
amounts above the sir  up to a certain dollar amount  are covered by our excess insurance policy 
we maintain excess liability insurance aggregating  with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of our self insured positions for products liability and personal injury matters 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the self insurance reserve was increased by  to provide for our full  sir related to an accident case arising out of our bus operations in the normal course of business 
based upon advice from outside legal counsel  we concluded that it was probable that settlement of the case would require us to pay an amount at least equal to the sir 
product warranty we generally provide customers of our products with a one year warranty covering defects in material or workmanship  with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold  existing dealer inventory  average cost incurred and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate  however actual claims incurred could differ from estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
warranty reserves are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted fin and related guidance 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

the company recognizes revenue on credit sales upon shipment and cod sales upon payment and delivery 
most sales are made by dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
products are not sold on consignment  dealers do not have the right to return products  and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floorplan lenders 
on average  the company receives payments from floor plan lenders on products sold to dealers within days of the invoice date 
repurchase commitments it is customary practice for companies in the recreation vehicle industry to enter into repurchase agreements with financing institutions to provide financing to their dealers 
generally  these agreements provide for the repurchase of products from the financing institution in the event of a dealer s default 
the risk of loss under these agreements is spread over numerous dealers and further reduced by the resale value of the units which the company would be required to repurchase 
management believes that any future losses under these agreements will not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company records repurchase and guarantee reserves based on prior experience and known current events 
investments we have an investment portfolio comprised of taxable and tax exempt auction rate securities 
the value of these securities is subject to market volatility for the period we hold these investments and until their sale or maturity 
we recognize realized losses when declines in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
in determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including market price when available  investment ratings  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  auction success and failure rates  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we make significant judgments in considering these factors 
if it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the investment is valued at the current fair value and a realized loss equal to the decline is reflected in net income which could materially adversely affect our operating results
