loans and risk descriptions real estate loans the bank originates loans secured by commercial real estate  one to four family residential properties  and multi family dwelling units or more units 
at december   these loans totaled billion  or approximately of the bank s loan portfolio 

table of contents the bank originates commercial real estate loans of up to of the appraised value 
currently  it is the corporation s policy to originate these loans only to carefully selected borrowers and on properties in the market area 
of primary concern in commercial real estate lending are the borrower s credit worthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project 
to monitor cash flows of borrowers  annual financial statements are obtained from the borrower and loan guarantors  if any 
the bank originates loans secured by first and junior liens on one to four family residences in its lending areas 
typically  such loans are single family homes that serve as the primary residence of the borrower 
generally  these loans are originated in amounts up to of the appraised value or selling price of the property 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these loans 
loans for multi family or more units residential properties are generally secured by apartment buildings 
loans secured by income generating properties are generally larger and involve greater risk than residential loans because payments are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
as a result  these types of loans may be more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
cash flow and financial statements are obtained from the borrowers and any guarantors 
also  rent rolls are often obtained 
consumer and other loans cadence offers consumer loans in the form of home improvement loans  mobile home loans  automobile loans and unsecured personal loans 
these loans totaled million  or of total loans  at december  consumer loans are originated in order to provide a wide range of financial services to customers 
in connection with consumer loan applications  the borrower s income statement and credit bureau report are reviewed 
in addition  the relationship of the loan to the value of the collateral is considered 
all automobile loan applications are reviewed  as well as the value of the collateral securing the loan 
cadence intends to continue to emphasize the origination of consumer loans 
management believes that its loan loss experience in connection with its consumer loan portfolio is favorable in comparison to industry averages 
the bank makes commercial business loans on both a secured and unsecured basis with terms generally not exceeding five years 
non real estate commercial loans primarily consist of short term loans for working capital purposes  inventories  seasonal loans  lines of credit and equipment loans 
a personal guaranty of payment by the principals of any borrowing entity is often required and the financial statements and income tax returns of the entity and its guarantors are reviewed

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations the following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of the corporation 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the supplemental financial data included elsewhere in this report 
introduction and management overview the corporation is a financial holding company that owns cadence 
cadence operates in the states of mississippi  alabama  tennessee  florida and georgia 
cadence s primary business is providing traditional commercial and retail banking services to customers 
cadence also provides other financial services  including trust services  mortgage services  insurance and investment products 
our stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol of cade 

table of contents cadence s profitability  like that of many financial institutions  is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and noninterest income sources 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income cadence receives on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense cadence pays on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
noninterest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts  trust  investment activities  mortgage origination  insurance and other customer services which cadence provides 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  occupancy and other operating expenses  including taxes 
economic conditions  competition  the regulatory environment  and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government in general  significantly affect financial institutions  including cadence 
lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by the level of business spending and investment  consumer income  spending and savings  capital market activities  competition among financial institutions  customer preferences  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in cadence s market areas 
during  three major factors significantly impacted our operating results  as follows a million increase in provision for loan losses due to a general deterioration in the real estate sectors of some of our markets  overall economic conditions  and credit downgrades on some customer relationships 
federal reserve rate reductions totaling four hundred basis points in these rate reductions impacted our yields on earning assets and cost of funds 
a million increase in legal fees  appraisal fees and other maintenance and holding expenses  as well as losses on sales of other real estate owned oreo  due to an increase in properties on which cadence has foreclosed 
for  our non tax equivalent net interest margin was  compared to for our loan yields declined by basis points between and  however  our overall cost of funds only declined by basis points 
pricing for deposits did not decline at the same pace as variable rate loans which comprise approximately of our loan portfolio because of the strong competition for these funds 
our margins were continually under pressure due to the rate reductions occurring throughout and the timing differences between the repricing of our interest bearing assets and liabilities 
our provision for loan losses was substantially higher in as compared to  due to a further deterioration in the real estate sectors of some of our markets  overall economic conditions  and credit downgrades on some customer relationships 
we do not engage in any sub prime or alt a lending  therefore  none of the increase in our provision for loan losses related to or was affected by these types of loans 
our underwriting standards have tightened based on recent changes in market conditions  and we believe that the current level of our allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  during  noninterest income  including gains and losses on securities  increased from million to million 
noninterest income for reflects an impairment loss on certain investment securities that related to our decision to rescind the application of fasb statement no 
to these securities 
the components of and other reasons for the increase in noninterest income are discussed more fully below 
noninterest income accounted for of income in  of income in  and of income in the growth of noninterest income continues to be an important part of our strategic goals 
one of our goals in was to continue to control the level of noninterest expenses 
during  total noninterest expenses increased by million  or  as compared to the year ended december  the majority of the increase  or million  is attributable to increased costs associated with oreo 
for  we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for in january  we closed on the sale of million in non voting preferred stock to the us treasury department under its capital purchase program 
this additional capital strengthens our capital base significantly above regulatory requirements 
we will deploy these funds into short term investments so that we can convert them quickly to fund future loan growth while minimizing our interest rate risks 
our goal is to offset the cost of the preferred stock dividend by conservatively leveraging this capital  however  this objective will be difficult in the current low interest rate and slow loan growth environment 
our most significant challenge for is credit quality 
we have taken an aggressive stance in addressing credit issues in our loan portfolio to minimize future risks 
we have increased our focus on underwriting standards and have revamped our 
table of contents loan policy 
we also have a special assets team in place to manage workout situations and to assist in the timely disposition of defaulted assets 
our management information systems relating to loan concentrations provide us with current and detailed information about the status of the loans in our portfolio 
we feel that these steps place us in the best position possible to manage credit quality  however  credit quality will remain an issue as long as current economic trends  including increasing unemployment rates and declining real estate prices  continue 
we expect our loan portfolio balance to remain flat or decline slightly during the first part of our recent loan growth was mostly attributable to real estate related credits  but with declining demand  higher credit standards for these loans  and the regulatory attitude toward real estate related loans  generating new loans in this current environment will be a challenge 
we intend to diversify our portfolio with more commercial loans as opportunities arise 
currently  we expect that interest rates will remain flat for we based our projections  budgets and goals on these expectations 
if these trends move differently than expected in either direction or speed  they could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the areas of our operations most directly impacted would be the net interest margin  loan and deposit growth and the provision for loan losses 
we remain focused on our strategy to build future earnings and understand that improved asset quality and margin growth are the real keys to achieving that strategy 
we also continue to refine our funding plan  including both the mix and the funding decisions we make  but remain within our policies regarding types of funding to be used 
to optimize costs  we must remain somewhat flexible 
the additional capital raised through the preferred stock sale to the us treasury will play an important part in supporting future loan growth 
we will also continue our efforts to control noninterest expenses by working to achieve maximum efficiencies within our new expanded footprint 
we continue to leverage the investments in infrastructure that we have made over the past few years and believe that they will continue to have a positive impact on our costs going forward  as well as provide us with a solid platform on which to expand future operations 
reducing our efficiency ratio remains a key objective 
however  our noninterest expenses will be negatively affected by the significant increase in fdic insurance premiums 
costs associated with oreo will also negatively affect our noninterest expenses in in summary  our largest challenges in are credit quality and improving our net interest margin 
we are managing our credit problems aggressively and refining our risk management processes in order to enhance our future earnings 
recently issued accounting standards and critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to united states generally accepted accounting principles and  where applicable  to general practices within the banking industry 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our accounting policies 
management is of the opinion that note a  read in conjunction with all other information in this report  including this management s discussion and analysis  is sufficient to provide the reader with the information needed to understand our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies it is management s opinion that the areas of the financial statements that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and therefore contain the most critical accounting estimates  are the provision for loan losses and the resulting allowance for loan losses  the liability and expense relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  issues relating to other than temporary impairment losses in the securities portfolio  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
provision allowance for loan losses our provision for loan losses is utilized to replenish the allowance for loan losses on the balance sheet 
the allowance is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management after their evaluation of the risk exposure contained in our loan portfolio 
the senior credit officers and the loan review staff perform the methodology used to make this determination of risk exposure on a quarterly basis 
as a part of this evaluation  certain loans are individually reviewed to determine if there is an impairment of our ability to collect the loans and the related interest 
this determination is generally made based on collateral value securing such loans 
if the senior credit officers and loan review staff determine that impairments exist  specific portions of the allowance are allocated to these individual loans 
we group all other loans into homogeneous pools and determine risk exposure by considering the following non exclusive list of factors historical loss experiences  trends in delinquencies and non accruals  and national  regional and local economic conditions 
these economic conditions would include  but not be limited to  general real estate conditions  the current interest rate environment and trends  unemployment levels and other information  as deemed appropriate 
additionally  management looks at specific external credit risk factors that bring additional risk into the portfolio 
for the year ended december   we identified the following external risk factors declining national and local economic conditions  increased risk associated with commercial real estate 
table of contents credits  and the deterioration of real estate sectors in specific markets 
these external risk factors are re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
management makes its estimates of the credit risk in the portfolio and the amount of provision needed to keep the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level using what management believes are the best and most current sources of information available at the time of the estimates  however  many of these factors can change quickly and with no advance warning 
due to the speed in which some real estate credits are deteriorating in the current environment  it has been very difficult to project future potential losses in the loan portfolio 
if management significantly misses its estimates in any period  it can have a material impact on the results of operations for that period and for subsequent periods 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans another area that requires subjective and complex judgments is the liability and expense relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
we maintain several benefit plans for our employees 
they include a defined benefit pension plan  a defined contribution pension plan  a k plan and a deferred compensation plan 
we make all contributions to these plans when due 
the defined benefit pension plan is the only plan that requires multiple assumptions to determine the liability under the plan 
this plan has been frozen to new participants for several years 
management evaluates  reviews with the plan actuaries  and updates as appropriate the assumptions used in the determination of pension liability  including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and increases in future compensation 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the discount rate and the expected rate of return on the plan assets have a significant impact on the actuarially computed present value of future benefits that is recorded on the financial statements as a liability and the corresponding pension expense 
in selecting the expected rate of return  management  in consultation with the plan trustees  selected a rate based on assumptions compared to recent returns and economic forecasts 
we consider the current allocation of the portfolio and the probable rates of return of each investment type 
management  with the assistance of actuarial consultants  selects the appropriate discount rate by performing an analysis of the plan s projected benefit cash flows against discount rates from a national pension discount curve a yield curve used to measure pension liabilities 
based on the analysis  management used a discount rate of in and and a discount rate of in we used an expected rate of return of for  and from a historical perspective  the rates of return on the plan were for  for  and for additionally  our philosophy has been to fund the plan annually to the maximum amount deductible under the internal revenue service rules 
as of december   the plan had a current accumulated benefit obligation of approximately million  and plan assets with a fair value of approximately million 
fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  requires us to recognize the funded status of the plan defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation on the balance sheet and to recognize in other comprehensive income any gains or losses and prior service costs or benefits not included as components of periodic benefit cost 
detailed information on our pension plan and the related impacts of these changes on the amounts recorded in our financial statements can be found in note m employee benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities a third area that requires subjective and complex judgments on the part of management is the review of the investments in the securities portfolio for other than temporary impairments 
eitf issue and fasb fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  require us to review our investment portfolio and determine if it has impairment losses that are other than temporary 
in making its determination  management considers the following items the length of time and extent to which the current market value is less than cost  evidence of a forecasted recovery  financial condition and the industry environment of the issuer  downgrades of the securities by rating agencies  whether there has been a reduction or elimination of dividends or interest payments  whether we have the intent or ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery of fair value  and interest rate trends that may impact recovery and realization 
during the first quarter of  we recognized a million impairment loss relating to certain collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities 
during the third quarter of  we recognized a million other than temporary impairment charge relating to certain fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
as of december   our securities portfolio included certain securities that were  by definition  impaired 
we reviewed each of these securities to determine if any of the impairments were other than temporary 
using the criteria listed above  we determined that none of the impairments were other than temporary as of december  
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets although fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill  it does require periodic testing for impairment 
due to the deterioration in the national financial markets in and the related impact on the fair value of the corporation  we engaged a third party to conduct our goodwill impairment testing in accordance with fasb statement no 
this testing was performed in the fourth quarter of and resulted in the conclusion that no impairment writedown was warranted 
at december   we had approximately million of goodwill on our balance sheet 
other accounting regulatory issues in the normal course of business  cadence makes loans to related parties  including our directors and executive officers and their relatives and affiliates 
we make these loans on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other parties 
also  the loans are consistent with sound banking practices and within applicable regulatory and lending limitations 
please see note o in the notes to consolidated financial statements and our proxy statement for additional details concerning related party transactions 
section of the sarbanes oxley act generally prohibits loans to executive officers 
however  the rule does not apply to any loan made or maintained by an insured depository institution if the loan is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the federal reserve act 
all loans that the bank makes to executive officers are subject to the above referenced section of the federal reserve act 
during and  we owned nbc capital corporation ms statutory trust i and enterprise tn statutory trust i  both organized under the laws of the state of connecticut for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
revised december  the trusts  which are considered variable interest entities  are not consolidated into our financial statements because the only activity of the variable interest entities is the issuance of the trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities related to enterprise tn statutory trust i were fully redeemed in december  and the trust was dissolved in january results of operations net loss for was million  or per diluted share  a decrease from net income of million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in return on average equity was in  in  and in return on average assets was in  in  and in net interest income  the primary source of our earnings  represents income generated from earning assets  less the interest expense of funding those assets 
changes in net interest income may be divided into two components the change in average earning assets volume component and the change in the net interest spread rate component 
net interest spread represents the difference between yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income decreased by million  or  from million in to million in average earning assets increased from billion in to billion in  an increase of million  or 
during this period  the net interest margin declined to  compared to for net interest margin is net interest income divided by average earning assets 
in analyzing the rate component of net interest income  from to  we lost basis points of yield on our earning assets 
however  during this period  the cost of funds decreased by basis points 
our loan portfolio  which is comprised of approximately variable rate loans  reflected a yield decrease from to from to  due to the basis point reduction in interest rates in the yield on our investment securities portfolio also declined from to  from to 
however  our cost of deposits declined from to  and our cost of other borrowings declined from to 
our loan yields and margin were also impacted by the reversal of interest income on loans that were placed on non accrual status 
during  these reversals of interest income totaled  compared to  for this difference amounted to five basis points of yield on our loan portfolio and four basis points on our margin 
also  we have recently generated fewer real estate development loans  which typically have higher yields 
this reduction in higher yield loans is a result of the softening economy  a reduction in demand for real estate development loans  and our focus on credit quality 
the increase of million in our average earning asset balances between and is attributable primarily to a million increase in average loan balance 
from to  the average balance of interest bearing deposits decreased by million  and the average balance of other borrowings increased by million 

table of contents net interest income increased by million  or  from million in to million in average earning assets increased from billion in to billion in  an increase of million  or 
during this period  the net interest margin declined to  compared to for in analyzing the rate component of net interest income  from to  we gained basis points of yield on our earning assets 
however  during this period  the cost of funds increased by basis points 
our loan portfolio  which is comprised of approximately variable rate loans  reflected a yield increase from to from to the yield on our investment securities portfolio also increased from to  from to 
however  our cost of deposits increased from to 
the primary reason for our increased net interest income between and is the increase in average earning asset balances

based on an evaluation of the risk exposure contained in the loan portfolio  management believes that the level of the allowance is adequate 
cadence s board of directors reviews and approves management s evaluation 
this is an ongoing process  and we review and determine the amount of the provision quarterly  using a methodology that has historically proven to be sound 
the provision for loan losses increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase for was due to the deterioration of some large credits  including two commercial loans  a bankruptcy of a customer  and an agricultural loan  as well as a softening in certain real estate sectors and a general softening in the economy 
the substantial increase for was due primarily to continued deterioration in the real estate sectors of some of our markets  overall national economic conditions  and credit downgrades on certain customer relationships 
please see the financial condition section of this management s discussion and analysis for additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
at this time  management believes that the level of the provision for loan losses for is appropriate based on the risk in the loan portfolio 
however  if during  any or all of these factors change in direction or speed  we will make the necessary adjustments in the provision for loan losses to reflect these changes 
noninterest income includes various service charges  fees and commissions we collect  including insurance commissions earned by galloway chandler mckinney insurance agency  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of cadence 
it has been  and continues to be  one of our strategic objectives to diversify our other income sources so that we can be less dependent on net interest income 
other income increased from million in to million in the changes in the major categories between and are as follows in thousands change service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions  fees  and premiums other service charges and fees trust department income mortgage loan fees securities gains losses  net bank owned life insurance income impairment loss on securities other total other income 
table of contents trust department income declined by  because of lower asset balances under management  reflecting the downturn of the equity markets during the year 
mortgage loan fees declined by  as a result of reduced home sales and demand for refinancing 
the increase in other noninterest income between and resulted primarily from a  gain on the sale of an asset held by the corporation  a  gain on the sale of a previously closed branch property in mississippi  and  in proceeds from the redemption of stock in visa 
changes in other accounts were not individually material 
we recognized  in net securities gains during  compared with  in net securities losses during during the first quarter of  we recognized a million impairment loss on certain collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and mortgage backed securities 
those securities were sold in early april and the proceeds reinvested in agency securities 
other income decreased from million in to million in the changes in the major categories between and are as follows in thousands change service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions  fees  and premiums other service charges and fees trust department income mortgage loan fees securities gains losses  net bank owned life insurance income impairment loss on securities other total other income service charges on deposit accounts increased by in  mostly due to improved management and oversight of our noninterest bearing accounts 
insurance commissions  fees  and premiums increased by in  because of an increase in profit sharing received from the insurance carriers based on loss experience 
other service charges and fees increased by  primarily due to increases in checkcard income and retail investment income 
trust department income increased by  because of higher asset balances under management 
mortgage loan fees increased by  as a result of our recent restructuring of the division and the expanding of our mortgage operations into our newer markets 
other noninterest income decreased significantly in this decline is mostly due to the following items included in noninterest income a  gain on the sale of our credit card portfolio  a  increase in earnings from our investment in a low income housing partnership  and  in gains on early extinguishment of debt related to prepayments on certain federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
changes in other accounts were not individually material 
we recognized  in net securities losses during  compared with  in net securities gains during during the first quarter of  we recognized a million impairment loss on certain cmos and mortgage backed securities 
those securities were sold in early april and the proceeds reinvested in agency securities 
during the third quarter of  we recognized a million other than temporary impairment charge relating to certain fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
those securities were sold in the fourth quarter of for amounts approximating their fair values 

table of contents noninterest expense represents ordinary overhead expenses 
these expenses increased from million in to million in the following table shows the detailed changes in the major categories of noninterest expense between and in thousands change salaries employee benefits net occupancy furniture and equipment communications data processing advertising professional fees intangible amortization loss on sale of assets other real estate owned other total other expense the decrease in net occupancy expense is mostly due to a decrease in premises rental expense and depreciation 
advertising expenses increased by in because of a general brand advertising campaign implemented during the year 
professional fees increased by in  due to increased legal fees associated with oreo  attorney consultations regarding our participation in the us treasury department s capital purchase program please see note x of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information  and the outsourcing of a portion of our credit review function 
other noninterest expenses increased by  due primarily to increases in fdic insurance premiums and expenses related to oreo 
prior to  cadence paid the majority of its fdic insurance premiums using credits with the fdic  however  these credits were depleted in early for  cadence s fdic insurance premiums expense totaled  compared with approximately  for due to the increased number of properties foreclosed on by cadence  we incurred increased legal fees  appraisal fees and other maintenance and holding expenses  as well as losses on sales of oreo 
these expenses totaled approximately million in  compared with  in the most significant component of this increase is a million writedown representing a decline in market value of oreo property that we hold and have not yet sold 
this writedown is reflected in the loss on sale of assets other real estate owned category of noninterest expense 
none of the changes in the other expense categories were considered to be individually material 
the following table shows the detailed changes in the major categories of noninterest expense between and in thousands change salaries employee benefits net occupancy furniture and equipment communications data processing advertising professional fees intangible amortization other total other expense the increase in salaries can be attributed to three primary factors a full year of salaries related to the former suncoast and seasons branches acquired in  a full year of salaries related to branches opened in memphis and brentwood  tennessee in  and salaries related to new branches in hoover  alabama and franklin  tennessee opened in for  salaries related to the former suncoast and seasons branches increased by million  salaries related to the new branches in memphis and brentwood increased by  and salaries expense for the new branches in hoover and franklin totaled  exclusive of these items  our overall salaries expense remained virtually flat  as normal raises were offset by increased staffing efficiencies 
however  employee benefits expense decreased by in  due primarily to pension costs associated with certain retirements in 
table of contents the increase in net occupancy expense and the increase in furniture and equipment expense are mostly due to increased depreciation  facility rental  and equipment rental expenses associated with new branches opened in hoover  alabama  and franklin  tennessee  and a full year of expenses related to the newer branches in memphis and brentwood and the former suncoast and seasons branches 
these branches accounted for million of the million increase in expense in these two categories from to none of the changes in the other expense categories were considered to be individually material 
changes in our income tax expense in and have generally paralleled changes in pre tax income 
our effective tax rates were in and in these changes resulted primarily from the mix of income from tax exempt investments and the percentage relationship of tax exempt income to total pre tax income 
the alternative minimum tax provision  the market supply of acceptable municipal securities  the level of tax exempt yields and our normal liquidity and balance sheet structure requirements limit our ability to reduce income tax expense by acquiring additional tax free investments 
the tax benefit for reflects the addition of tax free income of approximately million to our pre tax operating loss of million  to reflect a tax loss of approximately million 
the tax benefit of million reflects a rate of for  which is approximately the statutory rate 
in summary  net income declined from million  or per diluted share  in  to million  or per diluted share  in  and to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the million increase in our provision for loan losses for million after tax equates to approximately per share 
the million increase in oreo related expenses for million after tax equates to approximately per share 
the reduction in earnings per share in can be attributed to several factors  including the first quarter impairment loss of million million after tax  or per share  the million increase in our provision for loan losses million after tax  or per share  and the increase in average weighted shares outstanding  resulting from the million stock offering and shares issued in the suncoast acquisition during financial condition our balance sheet showed a slight decrease in total assets of million  or  from december   to december  cash and cash equivalents increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
the investment securities portfolio decreased slightly from million in to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the loan portfolio declined by million  or  during this slight decline was due primarily to the effects of the softening economy in our markets  declining loan demand  and our focus on credit quality 
in addition  we have seen increased competition to lend on quality credits in our markets 
during  the allowance for loan losses increased by million  or  from million to million 
we have tightened our underwriting standards for certain segments based on recent changes in market conditions 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the transactions in the allowance for loan losses for the three year period ended december  
table of contents the following table reflects some of the statistics we use to evaluate the quality and potential exposure within our loan portfolio 
classified assets included graded loans loans exhibiting some form of weakness  other real estate owned  and repossessed assets 
year ended year ended non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets as a percentage of total loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans classified assets as a percentage of average capital classified loans as a percentage of total loans net charge offs as a percentage of average net loans outstanding based on the evaluations described earlier and the information above  the allowances for loan losses at the end of and were deemed adequate to cover exposure in our loan portfolio 
the liability side of the balance sheet increased by million  or  from december   to december  during  deposits increased by million  or  to billion 
interest bearing deposits increased by million  or  and noninterest bearing deposits increased by million  or 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase declined by million  or  from million to million 
also during  other borrowed funds primarily fhlb advances declined by million  or 
our objective is to fund loan growth with the proper mix of retail and wholesale funding that will maximize net interest income and yet maintain our core deposits at an acceptable level 
capital resources and shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased from million as of december   to million as of december  during  we incurred a net loss of million and declared approximately million in dividends 
accumulated other comprehensive income improved from an unrealized loss of million in to an unrealized gain of  in the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income during included a million increase in the market value of the available for sale portion of our investment securities portfolio  a million adjustment to our pension liability  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 and a  unrealized gain on interest rate swaps 
the capital to asset ratio decreased from at december   to at december  peer organizations are traditionally in the to range 
current regulatory requirements call for a basic leverage ratio of for an institution to be considered well capitalized 
as of december   we maintained a leverage ratio of  significantly exceeding the ratio required for a well capitalized institution 
regulatory authorities also evaluate a financial institution s capital under certain risk weighted formulas high risk assets would require a higher capital allotment  lower risk assets a lower capital allotment 
in this context  a well capitalized financial institution is required to have a tier risk based capital ratio excludes allowance for loan losses of and a total risk based capital ratio includes allowance for loan losses of 
at the end of  we had a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as of december   these ratios were below our peer bank averages 
on january   we received million from the us treasury which is considered tier capital from the sale of preferred stock  allowing us to significantly increase our ratios 
if we had completed this transaction on december   for purposes of comparison  our ratios would have increased to the following leverage ratio  tier risk based capital ratio  and total risk based capital ratio 
dividends paid by the corporation are provided from dividends received from cadence 
under regulations controlling national banks  the payment of dividends by a bank without prior approval from the comptroller of the currency is limited in amount to the current year s net profit and the retained net earnings of the two preceding years 
at december   without approval from the comptroller of the currency  cadence does not have the ability to pay dividends to the corporation 
however  the corporation has sufficient liquidity at the holding company level to pay dividends to shareholders 

table of contents liquidity  inflation and asset liability management liquidity may be defined as our ability to meet cash flow requirements created by decreases in deposits and or other sources of funds or increases in loan demand 
we have not experienced any problems with liquidity during and anticipate that all liquidity requirements will be met in the future 
our traditional sources of funds from deposit growth  maturing loans and investments  wholesale borrowing lines and earnings have generally allowed us to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet our daily operational liquidity needs 
as the result of a million decrease in loans and a million increase in deposits in from  our loan deposit ratio declined from in to in our total funding sources include not only deposits  but also federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb borrowings 
when we include these sources of funding with deposits  our loans to total funding ratio declined from in to 
management s target loans to deposits ratio is in the range of  and our goal is to limit wholesale funding to no more than of total assets 
we offer retail repurchase agreements to accommodate excess funds of some of our larger depositors 
management believes that these repurchase agreements stabilize traditional deposit sources as opposed to risking the potential loss of these funds to alternative investment arrangements 
retail repurchase agreements  which we view as a source of funds  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the level of retail repurchase agreement activity is limited by the availability of investment portfolio securities to be pledged against the accounts and our asset liability funding policy 
because of the limited amount of retail repurchase agreements and the fact that the underlying securities remain under our control  we do not consider the exposure for this service material 
in september  we entered into a million structured repurchase transaction 
this transaction was a standard repurchase transaction with a fixed rate of and a forty two month term 
the transaction has a quarterly call option after one year 
in march  we restructured a million repurchase transaction initially entered into in december this transaction is a standard repurchase transaction with a fixed rate of and a thirty three month term 
the transaction has a quarterly call option after nine months 
we believe that normal earnings and other traditional sources of cash flow  along with additional fhlb borrowings  if necessary  will provide the cash to allow us to meet our obligations with no adverse effect on liquidity 
at december   we had the ability to borrow approximately million from the fhlb under the blanket line  a million available line of credit from the federal reserve  and other unused short term borrowing lines federal funds purchased lines of approximately million from upstream correspondent banks 
as of december   we had million in outstanding fhlb borrowings 
in december  we extended a secured line of credit with an upstream correspondent that provided us access to borrow up to million 
these borrowings would have been used to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes  provided that the borrowings used for purposes other than acquisitions did not exceed million 
no funds were ever borrowed under this line 
the term of the line of credit was two years 
interest on each borrowing would have been paid at the lender s base rate or at libor  plus annually 
we also paid a commitment fee  accruing at the annual rate of  on the daily amount of the unused commitment 
borrowings were contingent on our ability to maintain various operational and financial covenants  unless a waiver was granted 
we had pledged  shares of bank stock as collateral for these borrowings and additionally had agreed that such pledged shares will have a minimum book value of million 
we terminated this agreement in february  due to this upstream correspondent s decision to exit this line of business and the fact that we had adequate liquidity at the corporation s level to meet our cash needs 
we have no plans for the refinancing or redemption of any liabilities other than normal maturities and payments relating to the fhlb borrowings 
we do not have plans at this time for any discretionary spending that would have a material impact on liquidity 
under regulations controlling financial holding companies and national banks  cadence is limited in the amount it can lend to the corporation  and such loans are required to be on a fully secured basis 
at december   there were no loans between cadence and the corporation 
the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
fluctuations in interest rate and actions of the federal reserve board to regulate the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures have a greater effect on a financial institution s profitability than do the higher costs for goods and services 
the primary objective of rate sensitivity management is to maintain net interest income growth while reducing exposure to adverse fluctuations in rates 
the asset liability management committee of cadence s board of directors evaluates and 
table of contents analyzes our pricing  asset liability maturities and growth  and balance sheet mix strategies in an effort to make informed decisions that will increase income and limit interest rate risk 
the committee uses simulation modeling as a guide for decision making and to forecast changes in net income and the economic value of equity under assumed fluctuations in interest rate levels 
due to the potential volatility of interest rates  our goal is to stabilize the net interest margin by maintaining a relatively neutral rate sensitive position 
as of december   our balance sheet reflected approximately million more in rate sensitive assets than liabilities that were scheduled to reprice within one year 
this represents of our total assets and indicates that we are in an asset sensitive position 
this computation results from a static gap analysis that weights assets and liabilities equally 
management believes that interest rates will remain flat for and that our current position places us in the correct interest rate risk posture for this rate environment 
management does not believe that it is in our best interest to speculate on changes in interest rate levels 
although earnings could be enhanced if predictions were correct  if interest rates move against predictions  then cadence s earnings will be less than predicted 
we maintained a consistent and disciplined asset liability management policy during focusing on interest rate risk and sensitivity 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations during  we hedged a portion of our floating rate prime based lending portfolio using floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
as of december   we had two outstanding swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the original maturities on the swaps range from twelve months to fifteen months  and rates range from to 
these transactions were initiated to protect us from future downward fluctuations in the prime rate and to help ensure a more consistent cash flow from interest earned by our prime based lending portfolio 
these transactions are cash flow hedges as defined by fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and were accounted for in accordance with the provisions of that statement 
as required by fasb statement no 
 we measured the effectiveness of the transactions as of december  and determined that they remained highly effective  as defined by the statement 
the following table shows our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total due in less than year due in years due in years due after years fhlb advances subordinated debentures operating leases federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase other borrowings total contractual obligations the following table shows our other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands total expires in less than year expires in years expires in years expires after years lines of credit unfunded commitments standby letters of credit total commercial commitments 
table of contents market information our stock is listed on the nasdaq and is traded under the symbol cade

the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the range of sales prices of our common stock as reported on nasdaq for and and the dividends declared for each period 
year quarter high low cash dividend declared per quarter first second third fourth first second third fourth we have paid cash dividends on our common stock since our inception 
we currently estimate that dividends in will approximate per share 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  we manage exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
we do not have any trading instruments nor do we classify any portion of our investment portfolio as held for trading 
in   and  we entered into floating to fixed interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our floating rate prime based lending portfolio 
two of these hedges remain outstanding at december  the transactions are cash flow hedges as defined by fasb statement no 
and are accounted for under the provisions of such statement 
these transactions are in line with our asset liability strategy and were entered into to help protect the corporation against an unexpected downturn in short term interest rates 
as we continue to enhance our asset liability management  we will continue to look for opportunities to protect the corporation from unexpected changes in interest rates 
we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
the following table reflects the year end position of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which can either reprice or mature within the designated time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps can vary from day to day and are not necessarily a reflection of the future 
in addition  certain assets and liabilities within the same designated time period may nonetheless reprice at different times and at different levels 
in thousands december  interest sensitive within cumulative three months twelve months five years total interest earning assets loans investment and mortgage backed securities federal funds sold and other interest bearing liabilities deposits borrowed funds sensitivity gap dollar amount percent of total interest earning assets 
table of contents the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing within that same time frame 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income would result 
at december   total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year were more than interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period by approximately million cumulative  representing a positive cumulative one year gap of of earning assets 
management believes this position to be acceptable in the current interest rate environment 
banking regulators have issued advisories concerning the management of interest rate risk irr 
the regulators consider effective interest rate management an essential component of safe and sound banking practices 
to monitor our irr  our interest rate management practices include a risk management  b risk monitoring and c risk control as described below 
risk management consists of a system in which a measurement is taken of the amount of earnings at risk when interest rates change 
we first prepare a base strategy  which is the position of the bank and its forecasted earnings based upon the current interest rate environment or most likely interest rate environment 
the irr is then measured based upon hypothetical changes in interest rates by measuring the impact such a change will have on the base strategy 
risk monitoring consists of evaluating the base strategy and the assumptions used in its development based upon the current interest rate environment 
this evaluation is performed quarterly by management or more often in a rapidly changing interest rate situation and monitored by the asset liability management committee of cadence s board of directors 
risk control consists of setting policies and parameters regarding interest rates and performing simulations based on trends and projections 
interest rate risk is managed based upon our tolerance for interest rate exposure and the resulting effect on net interest income and the economic value of equity 
a balance sheet and income statement simulation model is prepared monthly  using current month end data 
a base case simulation is prepared monthly using current month growth trends  projected forward and a flat rate forecast 
two additional interest rate shock simulations are prepared  one showing rates rising basis points and one showing a basis point decline in rates 
our policy is that a basis point shock in rates should not cause the projection of net interest income to change by more than and cause the economic value of equity to change by more that than and 
the december model reflects net interest income under this scenario decreasing by with a basis point upward shock of rates and decreasing if rates are shocked down basis points 
at december   a basis point immediate increase in interest rates would have resulted in a increase in market value of equity  and a basis point instant decrease would have resulted in a decrease in market value of equity 
at december   we are within policy on both of these tests  and management believed that changes in net interest income and market value of equity  as reflected in our models  were acceptable
