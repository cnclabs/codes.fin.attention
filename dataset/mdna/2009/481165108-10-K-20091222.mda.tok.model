item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
references made to years are for fiscal year periods 
dollar amounts are in thousands  except share and per share data and as indicated 
the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations  financial position  cash flows  indebtedness  and other key financial information of joy global inc and its subsidiaries for fiscal   and for a more complete understanding of this discussion  please read the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
overview we are the direct successor to businesses that have been manufacturing mining equipment for as much as years 
we operate in three business segments underground mining machinery  comprised of our joy mining machinery business  surface mining equipment  comprised of our p h mining equipment business and continental crushing conveying 
joy is a leading producer of high productivity underground mining equipment used primarily for the extraction of coal 
p h is the world s largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a major producer of walking draglines and large rotary blasthole drills  used primarily for surface mining copper  coal  iron ore  oil sands  and other minerals 
ccc is a worldwide leader in crushing and sizing equipment and conveyor systems for bulk material handling in mining and industrial applications 
in addition to selling new equipment  we provide parts  components  repairs  rebuilds  diagnostic analysis  fabrication  training  and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines 
in the case of surface mining equipment  we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies  including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as alliance partners 
we emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business 
operating results net sales for fiscal totaled billion  compared with billion in fiscal this million increase in net sales was after a negative impact of million associated with changes in foreign currency translation rates during fiscal the increase in net sales was the result of a improvement in original equipment shipments and a million benefit from including continental sales for the full year in fiscal compared to eight months in fiscal aftermarket net sales in fiscal were substantially the same level as they were in fiscal net sales for the underground equipment business were up in fiscal compared to a year ago  while the surface mining equipment business reported a decline in net sales 
operating income totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in operating income was the result of increased volume  favorable pricing converting to sales  improved supply chain management  the benefits from cost control initiatives and million of cancellation income 
these favorable items were partially offset by a million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation rates  million of severance and related expenses and the effect of greater mix of original equipment sales 
the fiscal year was adversely impacted by a million charge related to the cancellation of a maintenance and repair contract in australia  a million higher level of purchase accounting amortization expense associated with the continental acquisition in february and a million charge related to a labor contract settlement 
net income was million or per diluted share in fiscal compared with million or per diluted share in fiscal bookings for fiscal were billion  excluding a million reduction in the backlog made during the third quarter to reflect the company s change in new order booking policy compared to bookings of billion in fiscal bookings decreases were seen across most commodity and geographic markets 
the decrease in bookings was made up of a billion decline in original equipment orders  a million reduction in aftermarket orders and included million of cancelled orders 
the decrease in original equipment orders reflect the increased ordering level of new machines which took place in the latter part of the fiscal year as customers wanted surety of equipment supply as commodity prices had risen to exceptionally high levels and then declined significantly at the beginning of the our fiscal year 
a large portion of these fiscal orders were for equipment to be delivered in fiscal and beyond and substantially all of the fiscal order cancellations and backlog adjustment came from bookings 
page market outlook demand for mined commodities continues to be dominated by strong imports from the emerging markets  and from china and india in particular  with improving but still weak fundamentals from the industrialized countries 
for the past year  china has been the major source of increased demand for commodities as it deployed a more effective stimulus program and more constructive credit policies 
however  the china economy is primarily driven by exports to the united states  europe and japan  and continued growth in commodity demand from china requires the return of industrial production in the industrialized countries 
industrial production outside of china has improved more recently as inventory de stocking reaches completion 
however  demand growth beyond the de stocking effect remains sluggish 
trends in us steel production can be indicative of broader industrial trends excluding china 
with steel production in the united states bottoming in april  by july  extensive de stocking had reduced steel inventories by over half 
since the completion of de stocking  steel production has improved as sales out of production replace previous sales out of inventory 
beyond the effect of completed de stocking  end use demand in the us remains soft 
seaborne metallurgical coal and iron ore demand remains strong as china steel production continues at high levels and imports are starting to move into other steel producing regions 
total china met coal imports were about six times higher than last year 
as a result  the seaborne met coal spot market is thin  with some producers already sold out for china imports  plus an increase in global steel production have pushed met coal spot prices well above this year s benchmark 
iron ore is under similar demand pressure  with its spot prices above per metric ton  off of a low in february 
the thermal coal outlook varies dramatically between the seaborne markets and the us market 
china and india are major factors in the seaborne market  with china imports already double imports increased significantly in due to rapidly improving electricity demand and the process of restructuring small mines in the shanxi and heibei provinces 
much of the increase is considered structural  with the electricity generators along the southeastern coast expected to rely increasingly on imported coal to avoid rail capacity constraints and because strong domestic prices are making imports competitive 
india s coal imports also continue to increase  with some projections showing coal imports potentially quadrupling by based on this continued strong emerging market demand  seaborne thermal coal spot prices have risen recently 
supply shortages are expected to continue  with seaborne thermal coal being contracted for and at even higher prices 
the thermal coal markets in the us continue to be weak  with demand from coal fired electricity generation down year to date 
there has been some seasonal improvement  and the most recent data shows coal fired generation up from its low in april 
as a result  generator stockpiles were reduced in both tons and days in the most recent report 
however  stockpiles remain at historically high levels  and will delay recovery in the us thermal coal market for to months 
on the positive side  higher natural gas forward month prices are reducing the economic incentive to dispatch natural gas fired plants  and gigawatts of new coal fired plants should add to thermal coal demand by copper demand has been increasing as china has strategically restocked  but with inventories high copper imports are expected to moderate 
however  china imports are expected to remain above their import levels of and based on a continued healthy demand from china and the expectation that demand from the rest of the world will turn positive later this year  the price forecast for copper has been revised up several times and is now well over  with the expectation of further supply shortages and price increases in seaborne traded commodity prices are strong and improving based on the strength of current demand from the emerging markets  the start of demand improvement from the industrialized countries  and the realization that mining will run out of excess capacity well before the industrial sector reaches its full capacity 
mining companies see the need to restart expansion projects and have been announcing significant increases in their capital expenditure budgets for page company outlook we see fiscal as the cyclical floor for incoming orders based on consistency of the order rate over the past four quarters  the continuation of strong commodity demand from the emerging markets complemented by improving commodity demand from the major industrialized countries  and the limited upside in current mining capacity 
our customers are increasing their capital expenditure budgets for fiscal  and are also validating equipment specifications and confirming production slots to enable them to reactivate some of the projects they previously put on hold 
as such  we expect fiscal to be a year of improving order rates 
we expect original equipment orders to return to their typical lumpy pattern due to the timing and size of each project 
based on commodity fundamentals and discussions with customers  we expect that copper  international coal  iron ore and oil sands to have the greatest potential for original equipment orders during fiscal original equipment orders for the us coal market will be limited to met coal demand and otherwise to machine replacements based on the higher productivity of new technology 
aftermarket orders in our second half of fiscal were up percent from the first half  and we expect this trend of steady improvement to continue as our international customers bring production back on line during fiscal the following represents countries included in our regional discussion within the underground mining machinery segment name countries eurasia europe  russia and india australasia australia americas north and south america china china south africa south africa page results of operations compared with sales the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal net sales as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal in thousands change change net sales underground mining machinery surface mining equipment crushing conveying eliminations total net sales for the underground mining equipment business increased million  or  despite a million adverse impact on fiscal net sales due to the impact of foreign currency translation changes during the current year 
the increase in net sales was the result of a million increase in original equipment sales combined with a million increase in the sales of aftermarket products and service 
original equipment sales in the americas increased by million primarily as a result of increased sales of room and pillar application equipment and roof supports used in long wall system applications 
original equipment sales also increased in south africa by million due to increased demand for equipment used in both room and pillar and longwall applications 
original equipment sales decreased by million in eurasia primarily due to decreased roof support sales while original equipment sales in china decreased by million primarily due to lower continuous miner and armored face conveyor sales 
aftermarket sales were flat or slightly down in all markets with the exception of the united states 
the surface mining equipment business was also unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation changes during the fiscal year  with million out of the net sales decline being attributable to the effects of foreign currency translation 
the decrease in net sales for surface mining equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million decrease in original equipment sales combined with a million decrease in aftermarket parts and service 
original equipment sales  primarily consisting of electric mining shovel sales  decreased in china and canada  partially offset by increased sales in the united states and australia 
reduced production activity by our customers translated into lower aftermarket products and service revenues with decreased sales of million in the united states  partially offset by increased sales of million and million in chile and canada  respectively 
the increase in net sales for crushing conveying in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million increase in original equipment sales  offset by a million decrease in aftermarket products and services primarily due to the continental conveyor acquisition made on february   and therefore the fiscal year only included eight and one half months of the continental conveyor net sales 
crushing conveying sales were also unfavorably impacted by million of foreign currency translation 
the eliminations represent the stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the underground mining machinery and surface mining equipment segments but managed as part of the crushing conveying segment 
page operating income the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal operating income as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal operating operating in thousands income loss of net sales income loss of net sales operating income loss underground mining machinery surface mining equipment crushing conveying corporate expense eliminations total operating income for underground mining machinery increased to million in fiscal  or of sales  as compared to million in fiscal  or of sales 
as was the case with net sales  operating income in fiscal was unfavorably affected by the impact of foreign currency translation rate changes 
this impact reduced operating income in compared to fiscal by million 
operating income increased in fiscal due to increased sales and improved price realization which contributed million  lower material costs  spending control measures and the benefits associated with the company s operating excellence initiatives  partially offset by the cost incurred in connection with various cost reduction actions and the effect of a higher mix of original equipment 
operating income for surface mining equipment increased to million in fiscal  or of sales  as compared to million in fiscal  or of sales 
the increase in operating income was primarily due to favorable price realization  reduced material costs  spending control measures and million of cancellation income 
in addition  fiscal operating income was unfavorably impacted by a million charge for the cancellation of a maintenance and repair contract in australia and a million charge for retiree benefit costs associated with the execution of the steelworkers agreement in milwaukee 
operating income for crushing conveying increased to million in fiscal  or of sales  as compared to million in fiscal  or of sales 
the increase in operating income was primarily due to a decreased amortization of million and inclusion of the conveyor business for all of fiscal as compared to eight and a half months in fiscal corporate expense increased by million primarily due to increased professional service fees  recruiting and relocation fees associated with the filling of senior management positions and an increase in equity incentive based performance compensation 
the eliminations represent the stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the underground mining machinery and surface mining equipment segments but managed as part of the crushing conveying segment 
product development  selling and administrative expense product development  selling and administrative expense for fiscal was million  as compared to million for fiscal the increase in product development  selling and administrative expense was primarily due to million of severance and other related expense associated with various cost reduction initiatives implemented during the fiscal year 
the increase in corporate expense outlined previously and general inflationary increases were offset by the favorable impact of million on spending amounts due to foreign currency translation and the spending controls put in place 
page provision for income taxes income tax expense for fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal the effective income tax rates from continuing operations were and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the main drivers of the variance in tax rates when compared to the statutory rate of were the geographic mix of earnings with the corresponding net favorable differences in foreign statutory tax rates and the utilization of tax credits and tax holidays offset by increased state income taxes and tax account corrections 
a discrete tax expense of million was recorded in fiscal as compared to a discrete tax benefit of million in fiscal a review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout fiscal and fiscal as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of million and million  respectively  was recorded on a global basis 
compared with sales the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal net sales as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal in thousands change change net sales underground mining machinery surface mining equipment crushing conveying eliminations total the increase in net sales for underground mining machinery in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million increase in original equipment combined with a million increase in aftermarket products and service 
original equipment sales in the americas increased by million  primarily due to growth in the central appalachia region across substantially all original equipment product lines 
original equipment sales also increased in china primarily due to increased armored face conveyor and shearer sales and in eurasia primarily due to the sale of a powered roof support system in fiscal united states aftermarket sales increased reflecting continued investment in both existing and greenfield metallurgical and thermal projects 
the increase in net sales for surface mining equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million increase in original equipment combined with a million increase in aftermarket parts and service 
increases in original equipment sales due to timing of production schedules primarily consisted of increased shovel revenue in the canadian oil sands  the united states  chile and china 
as a result of the increasing installed base of electric mining shovels  aftermarket sales increased by million in the united states  million in chile  and million in canada 
the net sales in crushing conveying represented the strength of the crushing equipment and conveying systems and aftermarket parts and services in the united states  australia and the united kingdom 
revenue from this segment was included from the february  acquisition date of nes investment co 
the eliminations represent the stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the underground mining machinery and surface mining equipment segments but managed as part of the crushing conveying segment 
page operating income the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal operating income as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal operating operating in thousands income loss of net sales income loss of net sales operating income loss underground mining machinery surface mining equipment crushing conveying corporate expense eliminations total operating income for underground mining machinery increased to million in fiscal  or of sales  as compared to million in fiscal  or of sales 
the increase in operating income was principally due to the impact of higher volume of million and lower pension expense of million  partially offset by the impact of a greater mix of lower margin original equipment of million  and increased performance based incentive compensation of million 
operating income for surface mining equipment increased to million in fiscal  or of sales  as compared to million in fiscal  or of sales 
the increase in operating income was principally due to increased sales volume of million offset by the settlement of a maintenance and repair contract in australia of million  increased performance based incentive compensation of million  the retiree benefit cost associated upon the execution of the steelworkers agreement in milwaukee of million and increased selling  general and administrative expenses to support the global mining infrastructure 
operating income for crushing conveying included million of purchase accounting charges in fiscal corporate expense increased by million due to increased performance based compensation  legal fees and severance costs 
the eliminations mainly represent the stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the underground mining machinery and surface mining equipment segment but managed as part of the crushing conveying segment 
product development  selling and administrative expense product development  selling and administrative expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in product development  selling and administrative expense was primarily due to of additional expenses related to the continental acquisition  million of higher selling expenses related to increased business activity and million increase in administrative costs due to increased incentive based compensation of million and global infrastructure development 
page provision for income taxes income tax expense for fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal the effective income tax rates from continuing operations were and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the main drivers of the variance in tax rates and income tax expense were higher utilization of us foreign tax credits and the associated subpart f earnings  tax holidays and incentives in fiscal  us state income taxes  mix of earnings year over year and differences in local statutory tax rates 
a discrete tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal to reflect us foreign tax credit recognition offset partially by us subpart f income not previously recognized  completion of an r d study to validate the available credits and by the tax required on a dividend between foreign subsidiaries 
fiscal also included a discrete tax expense of million which included taxes on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries during the fourth quarter not previously forecasted  the resolution of an r d study which resulted in the reversing of pre bankruptcy r d credits  and a reserve added following the quarterly evaluation of a previously disclosed contingent tax liability in south africa 
a review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout fiscal and as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of million and million  respectively  was recorded on a global basis 
reorganization items reorganization items include income  expenses  and losses that were realized or incurred by the predecessor company as a result of its decision to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
net reorganization items for fiscal  and consisted of the following fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands beloit uk claim settlement beloit uk receivership settlement resolution of contingent payable professional fees directly related to the reorganization net reorganization income expense critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  excess inventory  warranty  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the accounting policies described below are the policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
page revenue recognition we recognize revenue on aftermarket products and services when the following criteria are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and title transfer has occurred or the services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on long term contracts  such as for the manufacture of mining shovels  drills  draglines  roof support systems and conveyor systems  using either the percentage of completion or inventory sales method 
we generally recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method for original equipment that requires a minimum of six months to produce 
when using the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values 
estimated losses are recognized in full when identified 
approximately of our sales in fiscal were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service 
the remaining of sales was recorded using percentage of completion accounting  a practice we follow in recognizing revenue on the sale of long lead time equipment such as electric mining shovels  walking draglines  powered roof support systems and conveyor systems 
we have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of to years 
these contracts are established based on the conditions the equipment will be operating in  the time horizon that the program will cover  and the expected operating cycle that will be required for the equipment 
based on this information  a model is created representing the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms 
accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates  including estimates of the relevant machine s long term maintenance requirements 
under these contracts  customers are generally billed monthly based on hours of operation or units of production achieved by the equipment  with the respective deferred revenues recorded when billed 
revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided 
these contracts are reviewed quarterly by comparison of actual results to original estimates or most recent analysis  with revenue recognition adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs 
if a loss is expected at any time  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
in limited circumstances  we have customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the asc no 
multiple element arrangements 
the agreements are assessed for multiple elements based on the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values 
revenue recognition involves judgments  including assessments of expected returns  the likelihood of nonpayment  and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers  and current market and economic conditions  in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in  first out fifo method for all inventories 
we evaluate the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis 
our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material  work in process  finished goods  and spare parts 
inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  possible alternative uses  and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory 
page goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include drawings  patents  trademarks  technology  customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
as part of the impairment analysis  we use the discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were we to license the use of the trademark or tradename 
no impairment was identified as part of our fourth quarter impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  which is principally the straight line method 
intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value 
no impairment was identified related to our finite lived intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units  which we have identified as our operating segments  and tested for impairment at least annually  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach  in accordance with accounting standards codification asc no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
the determination of an impairment requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit  which we estimate using the discounted cash flow model and market approach 
the discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions  including operating results forecasts and discount rates 
inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  projected cost saving initiatives and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values 
we performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal and no impairment was identified 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units would not cause the carrying value of the respective reporting unit to exceed its fair value 
accrued warranties we record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
pension and postretirement benefits and costs pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and rate of compensation increases  discussed below discount rates we generally estimate the discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using a process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
we believe this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities 
expected return on plan assets our expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes 
our analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  however  the assumptions are primarily based on long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality rates mortality rates are based on the rp mortality table 
page rate of compensation increase the rate of compensation increases reflects our long term actual experience and its outlook  including consideration of expected rates of inflation 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense 
future changes affecting the above assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense 
as such  a change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense  respectively  as of and for the fiscal year ended october  increase decrease expected expected discount long term discount long term in thousands rate rate of return rate rate of return u 
s pension plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation non us pension plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation other postretirement benefit plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates 
deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period  adjusted for certain reclassifications under fresh start accounting 
additionally  we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria 
as required under the application of fresh start accounting  the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted  then intangibles until exhausted  and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital 
consequently  a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized 
we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained 
as of october   there were million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards 
all future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be recorded to additional paid in capital 
we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year on an interim basis 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual results are different from these estimates  adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
additionally  discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized 
page liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital as of october  and october   respectively october  october  in millions accounts receivable inventories other current assets short term notes payable  including current portion of long term obligations accounts payable employee compensation and benefits advance payments and progress billings accrued warranties other accrued liabilities working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents working capital we currently use working capital and cash flow production as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations 
we require working capital investment to maintain our position as a leading manufacturer and servicer of high productivity mining equipment with the primary drivers of these requirements being production and replacement parts inventories 
as part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes  we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules 
cash provided by operations for fiscal was million as compared to million provided by operations for fiscal cash used from decreases in customer advance payments and accounts payable were partially offset by cash generated by reductions in accounts receivable and inventories 
the decrease in advance payments was due to original equipment shipments in excess of bookings  and the decrease in accounts payable resulted from lower material receipts 
accounts receivable and inventories were down as working capital management processes continue to be improved 
cash used by investment activities for fiscal was million as compared to million used by investment activities for fiscal cash used by investment activities for fiscal was driven by million of capital expenditures  mainly consisting of upgrading our facilities and machine tools 
during fiscal  our wholly owned subsidiary  china mining machinery group srl  acquired of the outstanding shares of wuxi shengda machinery co  ltd  a chinese manufacturer of longwall shearing machines 
cash used by investment activities in fiscal was primarily due to the million acquisition of continental 
capital expenditures were million and primarily related to the upgrade of existing facilities  machines tools related to the tianjin facility  further sap implementations  and other projects 
page continental acquisition on february  we completed the acquisition of nes investment co 
parent and thereby its subsidiary  continental global group  inc a worldwide leader in conveyor systems for bulk material handling in mining and industrial applications 
the continental acquisition further strengthened our ability to provide a more complete mining solution to our customers 
we purchased all of the outstanding shares of the parent for an aggregate amount of million  which was net of approximately million of indebtedness we assumed at closing and million of cash acquired 
we also incurred million of direct acquisition costs related to the acquisition 
the purchase price was funded in part through available cash and credit resources and a new million term loan supplement to our existing credit agreement second amendment  as discussed below 
cash used by financing activities for fiscal was million as compared to million used by financing activities for fiscal cash used by financing activities for fiscal mainly consisted of the payment of dividends 
the cash used by financing activities for fiscal primarily consisted of the repurchase of outstanding stock of million and the payment of dividends  offset by the increase of million outstanding on our term loan supplement under the revolving credit facility 
we expect fiscal capital spending to be between to million 
capital projects will be monitored to ensure alignment with customer needs and prevailing economic conditions 
in addition to capital expenditures for the repair  replacement  and upgrading of existing facilities  we have debt service requirements  including quarterly principal payments on our term loan  commitment and letter of credit fees under our revolving credit facility and biannual interest payments due to holders of our senior notes issued in november we also have a net unfunded pension and other post retirement liability which we expect to contribute to million in fiscal in order to address these liquidity needs we have million of cash and cash equivalents at october   of which million is held outside of the united states million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility billion of backlog at october   of which is expected to be recognized as revenue in fiscal investment grade credit ratings by both moody s and standard and poor s we believe that cash generated from operations  together with borrowings available under our credit facility  provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements  including pension contributions  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures 
the long term fundamentals of the commodity cycle remain positive  however  near term softness will require continuous reevaluation of new projects to ensure that we are effectively allocating resources in line with current market conditions 
credit facilities we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility credit agreement which expires november  outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the london interbank offered rate libor rate defined as applicable libor rate for the equivalent interest period plus to or the base rate defined as the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus at our option 
we pay a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage 
the credit agreement also restricts payments of dividends or other return of capital based on the consolidated leverage ratio 
at october   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit agreement and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends or return of capital 
at october   there were no direct borrowings under the credit agreement 
outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement  which count toward the million credit limit  totaled million 
at october   there was million available for borrowings under the credit agreement 
the continental acquisition was funded in part through a new million term loan supplement to our existing credit agreement the second amendment 
the second amendment calls for quarterly principal payments of of the initial term loan through october   at which time the remaining outstanding principal equal to of the initial term loan is due 
as of october   million is outstanding on the term loan 
outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the libor rate which has a weighted average interest rate of 
as part of the second amendment  we have the option to request an increase to the term loan outstanding not to exceed million 
no changes were made to existing financial covenants 
page in november  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due notes with interest on the notes being paid semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  starting on may  the notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future significant domestic subsidiaries 
the notes were issued in a private placement under an exemption from registration provided by the securities act of securities act  as amended 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the notes were exchanged for similar notes registered under the securities act 
at our option  we may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price of the greater of of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate of a comparable treasury issue plus for the notes and for the notes 
credit rating our credit rating by both standard and poor s and moody s has remained consistent in fiscal standard and poor s credit rating is bbb with an outlook of stable 
moody s credit rating is baa with a continued outlook of stable 
these investment grade credit ratings provide us with greater flexibility to access financing on the open market as our business circumstances justify

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk volatility in interest rates  commodity price risk  and foreign exchange rates can impact our earnings  equity  and cash flow 
from time to time we undertake transactions to hedge this impact 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a hedge instrument is considered effective if it offsets partially or completely the impact on earnings  equity  and cash flow due to fluctuations in interest  commodity  and foreign exchange rates 
in accordance with our policy  we do not execute derivatives that are speculative or that increase our risk from interest rate  commodity price  or foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations 
the interest rate environment causes volatility in our variable rate borrowings and affects the value of our fixed rate debt 
we manage this risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt see note borrowings and credit facilities 
at october  we were not party to any interest rate derivative contracts 
commodity price risk we purchase certain raw materials  including steel and copper  which are subject to price volatility caused by systematic risks 
although future movements in raw material prices are unpredictable  we manage this risk through periodic purchases of raw materials and passing on some or all of the price increases to our customers
