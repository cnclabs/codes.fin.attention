item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition 
this section should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k 
statements in our discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution that a number of factors could cause future production  revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations 
see disclosures regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report and risk factors in item a for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks 
overview of our business we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  primarily in the southwestern  appalachian and gulf coast regions of the united states 
we operate in one segment 
we have a single company wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments 
we track only basic operational data by area 
we do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area 
we measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area by area basis 
our strategy is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects coupled with complementary acquisitions 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
our corporate headquarters are in fort worth  texas 
industry environment we operate entirely within the united states  a mature region for the exploration and production of oil and gas 
although new discoveries of oil and gas occur in the united states  because it is a mature region  the size and frequency of these discoveries is generally declining  while finding and development costs are increasing 
we believe that there remain areas of the united states  such as the appalachian basin and certain areas in our southwest and gulf coast areas that are underexplored or have not been fully explored and developed with the benefit of newly available exploration and production reservoir enhancement technology 
examples of such technology include advanced d seismic processing  hydraulic reservoir fracture stimulation  advances in well logging and analysis  horizontal drilling and completion techniques  secondary and tertiary recovery practices  and automated remote well monitoring and control devices 
oil and gas are commodities 
the price that we receive for the natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand 
demand for natural gas in the united states increased dramatically during this decade  however  the current economic slowdown has reduced this demand over the second half of and is continuing into demand is impacted by general economic conditions  weather and other seasonal conditions  including hurricanes and tropical storms 
over or under supply of natural gas can result in substantial price volatility 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile and we expect the volatility to continue in the future 
factors impacting the future supply balance are the growth in domestic gas production and the increase in the united states lng import capacity 
significant lng capacity increases have been announced which may allow for more lng imports resulting in increased price volatility 
a substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets 
realized oil and gas average prices increased from to as a result of narrowing excess worldwide capacity  weakness in the dollar  and continuing tension in the middle east  oil reached a record price of per bbl in july however  rising crude oil supplies  the tightened credit markets and lower demand in the slowing u 
s and global economies have caused recent oil prices to decline 
oil prices are expected to remain volatile 
although our average realized price including all derivative settlements received for oil and gas was per mcfe in the year ended december   prices were bolstered by record oil prices in the first half of the year 
in fourth quarter  our average realized price including all derivative settlements declined to per mcfe 
in a trend that began in the fourth quarter of and has continued into  the industry has experienced deteriorating basis differentials in the midcontinent and west texas areas primarily caused by an over supply of gas in these regions 

table of contents capital budget for our capital budget for is currently set at million  excluding acquisitions 
the capital budget is less than the capital spending levels due to lower expected operating cash flows resulting from declining oil and gas prices 
for  we expect our cash flow to fund our capital budget 
as has been our historical practice  we will periodically review our capital expenditures throughout the year and adjust the budget based on commodity prices and drilling success 
source of our revenues we derive our revenues from the sale of oil and gas that is produced from our properties 
revenues are a function of the volume produced  the prevailing market price at the time of sale  quality  btu content and transportation costs to market 
production volumes and the price of oil and gas are the primary factors affecting our revenues 
to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations  we use derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a significant portion of our gas and oil production 
during and  the use of derivative instruments prevented us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements and may do so in future periods 
our average realized price calculations including all derivative settlements include both the effects of the settlement of derivative contracts that are accounted for as hedges and the settlement of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges 
principal components of our cost structure direct operating expenses 
these are day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 
such costs also include maintenance  repairs and workovers expenses related to our oil and gas properties 
these costs are expected to moderate in as we expect industry demand for these services to decline 
direct operating expenses also include stock based compensation expense non cash associated with equity grants of stock appreciation rights sars and the amortization of restricted stock grants as part of employee compensation 
production and ad valorem taxes 
production taxes are paid on produced oil and gas based on a percentage of market prices not hedged prices or at fixed rates established by federal  state or local taxing authorities 
ad valorem taxes are taxes generally based on reserve values at the end of each year 
exploration expense 
these are geological and geophysical costs  including payroll and benefits for the geological and geophysical staff  seismic costs  delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory dry holes 
exploration expense includes stock based compensation expense non cash associated with equity grants of sars and the amortization of restricted stock grants as part of employee compensation 
general and administrative expense 
these costs include overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of maintaining our headquarters  costs of managing our production and development operations  franchise taxes  audit and other professional fees and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense includes stock based compensation expense non cash associated with equity grants of sars and the amortization of restricted stock grants as part of employee compensation 
abandonment and impairment of unproved properties 
this category includes unproved property impairment and costs associated with lease expirations 
interest 
we typically finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our bank credit facility and with our longer term debt securities 
as a result  we incur substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions 
we will likely continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow 
we expect our capital budget to be funded primarily with internal cash flow 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
this includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire  explore and develop gas and oil 
as a successful efforts company  we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts  and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
this expense also includes the systematic  monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
income taxes 
we are subject to state and federal income taxes but are currently not in a tax paying position for regular federal income taxes  primarily due to the current deductibility of intangible drilling costs idc 
we do pay some state income taxes where our idc deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income taxes are determined on another basis 
currently  substantially all of our federal taxes are deferred  however  at some point  we anticipate using all of our net operating loss carryforwards and we will recognize current income tax expense and continue to recognize current tax expense as long as we are generating taxable income 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of income and operations overview of results during  we achieved the following results achieved production growth and reserve growth  drilled net wells with a success rate  continued expansion of emerging plays  posted record financial results and maintained a strong balance sheet  completed acquisitions of properties containing bcfe of proved reserves  and completed million of asset sales 
our performance reflects another year of successfully executing our strategy of growth through drilling supplemented by complementary acquisitions 
the business of exploring for  developing  and acquiring oil and gas is highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing our operations are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders 
generating meaningful growth while containing costs presents an ongoing challenge 
during the recent period of historically high oil and gas prices  drilling service and operating costs generally increased due to increased competition for goods and services 
prices for oil and gas dramatically declined in the last half of and we are presently experiencing reductions in service costs which vary by region 
we faced other challenges in including attracting and retaining qualified personnel  consummating and integrating acquisitions  accessing the capital markets to fund our growth on sufficiently favorable terms and introducing new oil and gas extraction technologies into new regions and projects such as the pennsylvania marcellus shale 
we have continued to expand and improve the technical staff through the hiring of additional experienced professionals 
our inventory of exploration and development prospects continues to be strong  providing new growth opportunities  greater diversification of technical risk and better efficiency 
total revenues increased in over the same period of this increase is due to higher production and higher realized oil and gas prices 
our production growth is due to the continued success of our drilling program and to acquisitions completed in and average realized prices including all derivative settlements were higher in  although realized prices declined sharply in the last half of as discussed in item a of this report  significant changes in oil and gas prices can have a material impact on our balance sheet and our results of operations  including the fair value of our derivatives 
all of our expenses have increased on both an absolute and per mcfe basis when compared to  due to higher overall industry costs  higher compensation expense resulting from additional employees  increased salaries and higher levels of activity 
while overall costs were higher  the rate of inflation experienced in our industry has moderated for some goods and services as commodity prices weakened 
the availability of goods and services continues to be mixed  based on region and service company expertise 
we continue to experience competition for technical and experienced personnel and overall compensation inflation in our industry has moderated 
it is difficult for us to forecast price trends  supply  service or personnel availability  any of which  if changed in an adverse manner  would significantly impact both operating costs and capital expenditures 
as we continue to have marcellus wells shut in waiting on pipeline and processing facilities and we continue to expand our marcellus operating team to meet the needs of this developing asset  we expect to see continued upward pressure on our cost structure 
the initial phase of the pipeline and processing infrastructure was completed in fourth quarter with additional expansions set for and later 

table of contents oil and gas sales  production and realized price calculations our oil and gas sales vary from year to year as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes 
hedges included in oil and gas sales reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting 
cash settlement of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in the income statement caption called derivative fair value income loss 
oil and gas sales increased from due to a increase in production and a increase in realized prices

table of contents derivative fair value income loss increased to a gain of million in compared to a loss of million in and a gain of million in some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but are  to a degree  an economic offset to our commodity price exposure 
these contracts are accounted for using the mark to market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value income loss in the revenue section of our statement of operations 
mark to market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as commodity prices increase or decrease  such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark to market value of our derivatives 
because oil and gas prices declined dramatically in the last half of  our derivatives became comparatively more valuable 
however  we expect these gains will be offset by lower wellhead revenues in the future 
we have also entered into basis swap agreements to limit volatility caused by changing differentials between index and regional prices received 
basis swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting purposes and are marked to market 
hedge ineffectiveness  also included in derivative fair value income loss  is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no

as we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment  more leasehold impairments and abandonments will be recorded 
deferred compensation plan expense was a gain of million in compared to a loss of million in and a loss of million in this non cash expense relates to the increase or decrease in value of the vested range common stock held in our deferred compensation plan 
the deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense

the debt and equity capital markets have recently exhibited adverse conditions 
continued volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and affect our ability to access those markets 
at this point  we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent events in the global financial markets and we do not expect our liquidity to be materially impacted in the near future 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity and the credit markets 
additionally  we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of the twenty six lenders in our bank credit facility 
to date we have experienced no disruptions in our ability to access the bank credit facility 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment 
for additional information  see risk factors difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in item a of this report 
in december  we elected to utilize the expansion option under our bank credit facility and increased our credit facility commitment by million  which makes the current bank commitment billion 
at december   our borrowing base was billion 
the borrowing base represents the amount approved by the bank group than can be borrowed based on our assets while the bank commitment or facility amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the credit agreement 
we currently believe our maximum credit facility borrowing capacity exceeds our current borrowing base and  based on current circumstances  is sufficient to absorb a decline in commodity prices or any changes in bank lending practices 
during  our net cash provided from continuing operations of million  proceeds from our april common stock offering of million  proceeds from our may note offering of million  proceeds from the sale of assets of million and bank borrowings were used to fund billion of capital expenditures including acquisitions and equity investments 
at december   we had  in cash and total assets of billion 
our debt to capitalization ratio was at december  compared to at december  as of december  and  our total capitalization was as follows in thousands bank debt senior subordinated notes and other total debt stockholders equity total capitalization debt to capitalization ratio long term debt at december  totaled billion  including million of bank credit facility debt and billion of senior subordinated notes 
our available committed borrowing capacity at december  was million 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and gas industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves 
we currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility combined with our oil and gas price hedges currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near term financial obligations and liquidity needs 
however  long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business 
a material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures  reduce debt  meet financial obligations and remain profitable 
we operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks  including  but not limited to  the inherent risks of the search for  development and production of oil and gas  the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry 
our ability to expand our reserve base is  in part  dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow  bank borrowings  asset sales or the issuance of debt or 
table of contents equity securities 
there can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves 
our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward looking statements are based on currently available information 
if this information proves to be inaccurate  future availability of financing may be adversely affected 
factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance  the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets  investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance  the global financial climate and  in particular  with respect to borrowings  the level of our working capital or outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies 
for additional information  see risk factors difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in item a of this report 
credit arrangements we maintain a billion revolving credit facility  which we refer to as our bank debt or our bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and matures on october  availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders semi annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances 
the borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors  primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows 
redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of rds of the lenders  increases require unanimous approval 
at february   the bank credit facility had a billion borrowing base and a billion facility amount 
remaining credit availability is million on february  our bank group is comprised of twenty six commercial banks  with no one bank holding more than of the bank credit facility 
we believe our large number of banks and relatively low commitment hold levels allows for sufficient lending capacity should we elect to increase our billion commitment up to the billion borrowing base and also allows for flexibility should there be additional consolidation within the banking sector 
in december  we elected to utilize the expansion option under the bank credit facility and increased our credit facility commitment by million  which made the current commitment billion 
our bank debt and our subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined under the debt agreements for our bank debt and our subordinated notes 
the debt agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence  working capital  dividends and financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  cash flow cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices  net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives 
our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital 
we sell substantially all of our oil and gas production at the wellhead under floating market contracts 
however  we generally hedge a substantial  but varying portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next to months 
any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production 
production receipts  however  often lag payments to the counterparties 
any interim cash needs are funded by borrowing under the credit facility 
as of december   we have entered into hedging agreements covering bcfe for net cash provided from continuing operations in was million  compared to million in and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities from to and from to was primarily due to increased production from acquisitions and development activity and higher price realizations 
cash provided from operations is largely dependent upon prices received for oil and gas production 
as of february   we have hedged approximately of our projected production 
net cash provided from continuing operations is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements 
changes in working capital as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for was a positive million compared to a negative million in and a positive million in net cash used in investing activities in was billion compared to billion in and million in in  we spent million on additions to oil and gas properties  million on acquisitions and million on equity method investments and other assets 
acquisitions in include the purchase of producing and non producing barnett shale properties and marcellus shale leasehold 
in  we spent million in additions to oil and gas properties  million on acquisitions and million on equity method investments 
acquisitions in included acquiring additional interests in the nora field of virginia where we entered into a joint development plan with equitable resources  inc also in  we recognized proceeds of million from the sale of assets 
the period included million in additions to oil and gas properties and million of acquisitions 
acquisitions in include the purchase of stroud energy  inc  which had operations in the barnett shale 

table of contents net cash provided from financing activities in was million  compared to million in and million in historically  sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings 
during  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior subordinated notes and proceeds of million from a common stock offering 
during  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior subordinated notes due and proceeds of million from a common stock offering 
during  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior subordinated notes due in  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
during  we expended million to acquire  shares 
capital requirements our primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends 
during  million of capital was expended on drilling projects 
also in  million was expended on acquisitions of additional interests in producing properties and unproved acreage 
the capital program  excluding acquisitions  was funded by net cash flow from operations  proceeds from asset sales  debt and equity offerings and borrowings under our bank credit facility 
our capital expenditure budget for is currently set at million  excluding acquisitions 
development and exploration activities are highly discretionary  and  for the foreseeable future  we expect such activities to be maintained at levels equal to internal cash flow 
to the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow and proceeds from asset sales  debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements 
we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months  however  a continued drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations 
we monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis  adjusting the amount up or down and also between our operating regions  depending on commodity prices  cash flow and projected returns 
also  our obligations may change due to acquisitions  divestitures and continued growth 
we may issue additional shares of stock  subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  extend maturities or to repay debt 
cash dividend payments the amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the board of directors and primarily depends on earnings and capital expenditures 
in  we paid million in dividends to our common shareholders per share in each quarter 
in  we paid million in dividends to our common shareholders per share in the fourth quarter and per share in the third  second and first quarters 
in  we paid million in dividends to our common stockholders per share in the fourth quarter and per share in the third  second and first quarters 
cash contractual obligations our contractual obligations include long term debt  operating leases  drilling commitments  derivative obligations  other liabilities and transportation commitments 
as of december   we do not have any capital leases nor have we entered into any material long term contracts for equipment 
as of december   we do not have any significant off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any unrelated party 
the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at december  in addition to the contractual obligations listed on the table below  our balance sheet at december  reflects accrued interest payable on our bank debt of  which is payable in first quarter we expect to make interest payments of million per year on our senior subordinated notes  million per year on our senior subordinated notes  million per year on our senior subordinated notes due  million per year on our senior subordinated notes due and million per year on our senior subordinated notes 

table of contents the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at december  and their future maturities

interest paid on our bank credit facility would be approximately million each year assuming no change in the interest rate or outstanding balance 
b derivative obligations represent net open derivative contracts valued as of december  while such payments will be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production  production receipts may be received after our payments to counterparties  which can result in borrowings under our bank credit facility 
c the ultimate settlement and timing cannot be precisely determined in advance 
d this table excludes the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets 
in addition to the amounts included in the above table  we have contracted with a pipeline company through to deliver natural gas production volumes in appalachia from certain marcellus shale wells 
the agreement calls for incremental increases over the initial  mmbtu per day 
these increases  which are contingent on certain pipeline modifications  are for  mmbtu per day in march   mmbtu per day in october   mmbtu per day march and an additional  mmbtu per day for july for a total increase of  mmbtu per day 
delivery commitments under a sales agreement with enterprise products operating  llc  we have an obligation to deliver  mmbtu per day of volume at various delivery points within the barnett shale basin 
the contract  which began in  extends for five years ending march as of december   remaining volumes to be delivered under this commitment are approximately bcf 
hedging oil and gas prices we use commodity based derivative contracts to manage exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
we do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes 
these contracts consist of collars and fixed price swaps 
we do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions  knockouts or extendable swaps 
while there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising oil and gas prices may not be captured  we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important 
among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions  the flexibility to enter into long term projects requiring substantial committed capital  smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs  more consistent returns on invested capital  and better access to bank and other credit markets 
at december   swaps were in place covering bcf of gas at prices averaging per mcf 
we also had collars covering bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of to and million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of to 
their fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be 
table of contents realized or payable on termination  based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  approximated a pretax gain of million at december  the contracts expire monthly through december at december   the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding period contract type volume hedged average hedge price natural gas swaps  mmbtu day collars  mmbtu day crude oil collars  bbl day in addition to the swaps and collars above  we have entered into basis swap agreements 
the price we receive for our production can be less than nymex price because of adjustments for delivery location basis  relative quality and other factors  therefore  we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments 
the fair value of the basis swaps was a net unrealized pre tax gain of million at december  interest rates at december   we had billion of debt outstanding 
of this amount  billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
bank debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  which averaged at year end the day libor rate on december  was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost us approximately million in additional annual interest expense 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position  or for any other purpose 
however  as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we have various contractual work commitments as described above under cash contractual obligations 
inflation and changes in prices our revenues  the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices and the costs to produce our reserves 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict 
in a trend that began in the fourth quarter of and has continued into  the industry has experienced deteriorating basis differentials in the mid continent and west texas areas primarily caused by an over supply of gas in these regions 
although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation  inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business 
in a trend that began in and accelerated through the middle of  commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly 
the higher prices have led to increased activity in the industry and  consequently  rising costs 
these cost trends have put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on our capital costs 
due to the decline in commodity prices in the last half of  we expect these costs to moderate in

debt ratings we receive debt credit ratings from standard poor s ratings group  inc s p and moody s investor services  inc 
moody s  which are subject to regular reviews 
s p s rating for us is bb with a stable outlook 
moody s rating for us is ba with a stable outlook 
we believe that s p and moody s consider many factors in determining our ratings including production growth opportunities  liquidity  debt levels  asset  and proved reserve mix 
we also believe that the rating agencies take into consideration our size  corporate structure  the complexity of our capital structure and organization  and history of how we have chosen to finance our growth 
we believe that our simple balance sheet  singular line of business  and practice of funding our growth with a balanced mix of long term debt and common equity positively impact our ratings 
in addition to qualitative and quantitative factors unique to range  we believe that the rating agencies consider various macro economic factors such as the projected future price of oil and gas  trends in industry service costs  and global supply and demand for energy 
based upon the factors influencing our credit ratings which are within our control  we are not currently aware of any reason why our credit rating would change materially from the present ratings 
a reduction in our debt ratings could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate  fees and other terms associated with such additional financing 

table of contents management s discussion of critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if a the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes  and b the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
oil and gas properties we use the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration drilling costs are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and gas reserves as estimated by our engineers and reviewed by independent engineers 
costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our balance sheet if a the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and b we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
proven property leasehold costs are amortized to expense using the units of production method based on total proved reserves 
properties are assessed for impairment as circumstances warrant at least annually and impairments to value are charged to expense 
the successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves  which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes 
proved reserves are defined by the sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price and cost changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates used by us 
we cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods 
reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our senior vice president of reservoir engineering who reports directly to our president 
to further ensure the reliability of our reserve estimates  we engage independent petroleum consultants to review our estimates of proved reserves 
independent petroleum consultants reviewed of our reserves in compared to in and historical variances between our reserve estimates and the aggregate estimates of our consultants have been less than 
the reserves included in this report are those reserves estimated by our employees 
depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties 
as the estimated reserves are adjusted  the depletion expense for a property will change  assuming no change in production volumes or the capitalized costs 
while total depletion expense for the life of a property is limited to the property s total cost  proved reserve revisions result in a change in timing when depletion expense is recognized 
downward revisions of proved reserves result in an acceleration of depletion expense  while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of depletion expense 
table of contents recognition 
based on proved reserves at december   we estimate that a change in proved reserves would increase or decrease depletion expense by approximately million assuming a production increase 
estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property  which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired 
reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities in note to our consolidated financial statements 
changes in the estimated reserves are considered in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis 
we monitor our long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented 
we must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of future production  future production costs  future abandonment costs  and future inflation 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves  physical damage to production equipment and facilities  a change in costs  or other changes to contracts or environmental regulations 
all of these factors must be considered when testing a property s carrying value for impairment 
the review is done by determining if the historical cost of proved properties less the applicable accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization is less than the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows 
the expected future net cash flows are estimated based on our plans to produce and develop proved reserves 
expected future net cash inflow from the sale of production of reserves is calculated based on estimated future prices and estimated operating and development costs 
we estimate prices based upon market related information including published futures prices 
the estimated future level of production is based on assumptions surrounding future levels of prices and costs  field decline rates  market demand and supply  the economic and regulatory climates 
when the carrying value exceeds the sum of future net cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair market value as determined by discounted future net cash flows and the carrying value of the asset 
we cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future 
our historical impairment of producing properties has been million in  million in  million in  million in and million in we believe that a sensitivity analysis regarding the effect of changes in assumptions on estimated impairment is impractical to provide because of the number of assumptions and variables involved which have interdependent effects on the potential outcome 
we are required to develop estimates of fair value to allocate purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information on these acquisitions 
we adhere to the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties 
the greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leaseholds 
the costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated at least quarterly as to recoverability  based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management 
we consider a combination of time  geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs 
unproved properties had a net book value of million in compared to million in and million in we have recorded abandonment and impairment expense related to unproved properties of million in compared to million in and  in oil and gas derivatives we enter into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and gas production 
these contracts have historically consisted of options  in the form of collars  and fixed price swaps 
every derivative instrument is required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
we record these values on our balance sheet as either unrealized derivative gains or unrealized derivative losses 
if a derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting  changes in the fair value of effective portion are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet  which is later transferred to earnings when the hedged transaction occurs 
realized gains or losses of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are included in oil and gas sales in our statement of operations 
oil and gas sales include million of losses in compared to gains of million in and losses of million in 
table of contents some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges but are  to a degree  an economic offset of our commodity price exposure 
these contracts are accounted for using the mark to market accounting method 
under this method  all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations under the caption derivative fair value income loss 
as of december   derivatives for bcfe no longer qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting 
we have also entered into basis swap agreements which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are also marked to market 
the price we receive for our gas production can be less than the nymex price because of adjustments for delivery location  or basis  relative quality and other factors  therefore  we have entered into basis swap agreement that effectively fix our basis adjustments for a portion of our production 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
for those financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
it does not require us to make any new fair value measurements  but rather establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
derivative assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value 
hierarchical levels defined by sfas no 
and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  time value  volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economics measures 
our derivatives  which consist primarily of commodity swaps and collars  are valued using commodity market data  which is derived by combining raw inputs and quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves 
where observable inputs are available  directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  the instrument is categorized in level level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value 
at december   we have no level measurements 
for range  the primary impact from the adoption of sfas no 
at january  related to the fair value measurement of our marketable securities held in our deferred compensation plan and the fair value measurement of our derivative instruments 
fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for certain non financial asset and non financial liabilities  which for us includes the initial measurement of asset retirement obligations 
we will adopt sfas for non financial assets and liabilities effective january  and it is not expected to have a significant impact on our reported financial position or earnings 
we use a market approach for our value measurements 
the assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our trading securities in level are exchange traded and measured at fair value with a market approach using december  market values 
our commodity derivatives in level are measured using third party pricing services which have been corroborated with data from active markets or broker quotes 
our exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with the majority of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts 
our derivative counterparties include twelve financial institutions  ten of which are secured lenders in our bank credit facility 
we have two counterparties that are not part of our bank group and three counterparties in our bank group with no master netting agreements 
mitsui co 
and j 
aron company are the two counterparties not in our bank group 
at december   our net derivative receivable includes a receivable from j 
aron company of  and a receivable from mitsui co 
of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts 
while our counterparties are major investment grade financial institutions  the fair value of our derivative contracts have been adjusted to account for the risk of non performance by the counterparty  which was immaterial 

table of contents asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of retirement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation  aro  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
for example  as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment information  we may revise our estimate of current costs  the assumed annual inflation of the costs and or the assumed productive lives of our wells 
during  we increased our existing estimated asset retirement obligation by million or approximately of the asset retirement obligation at december  in addition  increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense  a component of depletion  depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statement of operations 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
we do not provide for a market risk premium because a reliable estimate cannot be determined 
deferred taxes we are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year  tax returns are subject to audit  which can take years to complete  and future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized 
we have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized 
in determining deferred tax liabilities  accounting rules require accumulated other comprehensive income to be considered  even though such income or loss has not yet been earned 
at year end  deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by million  with million of deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized hedging gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
at year end  deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by million  with million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized hedging losses included in oci 
we may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in our various income tax returns 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes  gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters 
contingent liabilities a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  we often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts 
we monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information 
although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely  particularly our outstanding litigation  we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities 
revenue recognition oil  gas and natural gas liquids are recognized when the products are sold and delivery to the purchaser has occurred 
we use the sales method to account for gas imbalances  recognizing revenue based on gas delivered rather than our working interest share of gas produced 
we recognize the cost of revenues  such as transportation and compression expense  as a reduction of revenue 

table of contents stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r on january  we previously accounted for stock awards under the recognition and measurement principles of abb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
prior to january  stock based employee compensation for restricted stock was reflected in our statement of operations  but no compensation expense was recognized for stock options granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective application method  we have applied the standards to awards made after adoption 
additionally  compensation cost for the unvested portion of stock awards outstanding as of january  has been recognized as compensation expense as the requisite service is rendered after january  we recognize stock based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
the expense we recognize is net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on prior experience and adjust it as circumstances warrant 
the compensation committee grants restricted stock to certain employees and to non employee directors of the board of directors as part of their compensation 
compensation expense is recognized over the balance of the vesting period  which is typically three years for employee grants and immediate vesting for non employee directors 
all restricted shares that are granted are placed in the deferred compensation plan 
all vested restricted stock held in our deferred compensation plan is marked to market each reporting period based on the market value of our stock 
this mark to market is presented in the caption deferred compensation plan in our statement of operations 
see additional information in note the fair value of stock options and stock settled sars is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the model employs various assumptions  based on management s best estimates at the time of the grant  which impact the fair value calculated and ultimately  the expense that is recognized over the life of the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued staff position no 
eitf determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  fsp eitf which provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method 
fsp eitf is effective for us january  and all prior period eps data including any amounts related to interim periods  summaries of earnings and selected financial data will be adjusted retroactively to conform to its provisions 
early application of fsp eitf is not permitted 
although restricted stock awards meet this definition  we do not expect the application of fsp to have a significant impact on our reported earnings per share

the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting 
it changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
the statement will apply prospectively to business combinations occurring in our fiscal year beginning january  the effect of adopting sfas no 
r is not expected to have an effect on our reported financial position or earnings 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  
table of contents but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposure 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
all accounts are us dollar denominated 
financial market risk the debt and equity markets have recently exhibited adverse conditions 
the unprecedented volatility and upheaval in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and may affect our ability to access those markets 
at this point  we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent events in the global markets and we do not expect our liquidity to be materially impacted in the near future 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity and the capital markets 
additionally  we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of our twenty six lenders in the bank credit facility 
see also item a 
risk factors 
market risk our major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices 
realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american gas production 
oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
commodity price risk we periodically enter into derivative arrangements with respect to our oil and gas production 
these arrangements are intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations 
certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty 
our derivatives program also includes collars  which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price 
as of december   we had oil and gas swaps in place covering bcf of gas 
we also had collars covering bcf of gas and million barrels of oil 
these contracts expire monthly through december the fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of december   approximated a net unrealized pre tax gain of million 
at december   the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding average fair period contract type volume hedged hedge price market value in thousands natural gas swaps  mmbtu day  collars  mmbtu day  crude oil collars  bbl day  other commodity risk we are impacted by basis risk  caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity 
natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets 
if commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions  derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge  resulting in increased basis risk 
in addition to the collars and swaps above  we have entered into basis swap agreements 
the price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the nymex price because of adjustments for delivery location basis  relative quality and other factors  therefore  we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments 
the fair value of the basis swaps was a net realized pre tax gain of million at december  
table of contents the following table shows the fair value of our swaps and collars and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a change in commodities prices at december  the hypothetical change in fair value would be a gain or loss depending on whether prices increase or decrease in thousands hypothetical change in fair value fair value swaps collars our commodity based contracts expose us to the credit risk of non performance by the counterparty to the contracts 
our exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with the majority of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts 
our derivative counterparties include twelve financial institutions  ten of which are secured lenders in our bank credit facility 
we have two counterparties that are not part of our bank group and three counterparties in our bank group with no master netting agreement 
mitsui co

in accordance with sfas no 
 counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts 
while counterparties are major investment grade financial institutions  the fair value of our derivative contracts have been adjusted to account for the risk of non performance by counterparty  which was immaterial 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt 
we attempt to balance variable rate debt  fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs  interest rate volatility and financing risk 
this is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt 
at december   we had billion of debt outstanding 
of this amount  billion bears interest at a fixed rate averaging 
bank debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  which was on that date 
on december   the day libor rate was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost us approximately million in additional annual interest expense
