item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of fiscal and  we are no longer offering video encoder and decoder products and are no longer marketing fiberglass antennas to commercial broadcast customers 
we continue to be involved in negotiations and discussions relating to large international over the horizon microwave system opportunities  and we believe that at least one of these contract opportunities will generate revenues by the second half of fiscal these contracts have had and continue to experience lengthy sales cycles and although we expect to ultimately receive and generate revenue from one or more of these contract awards during the second half of fiscal  it remains difficult to predict the timing of any potential contract award or related revenue 
bookings  sales and profitability in our telecommunications transmission segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors  including the strength of our satellite earth station product line bookings and the timing and related receipt of  and performance on  large contracts from the us government and international customers for our over the horizon microwave systems 
mobile data communications segment although our ability to forecast specific customer fielding schedules  amounts and timing of future orders and product mix requirements remains almost unpredictable  we expect that our mobile data communications segment will report record sales in fiscal we currently have approximately million of backlog in this segment  of which a substantial portion is for the shipment or the inclusion of new mts ruggedized computers and related accessories 
these mts ruggedized computers are manufactured and are currently expected to be delivered timely directly by a third party supplier 
a nominal amount of mts computer shipments were made in fiscal and we expect our third party supplier to reach full scale production during the first half of fiscal however  if these computers are not delivered timely by the third party supplier or if actual field deployment schedules are delayed  our business outlook could be impacted 
bookings  sales and profitability in our mobile data communications segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors  including unpredictable funding  deployment and technology decisions by the us government as well as risks associated with the uncertainty of the prevailing political and economic environments 
rf microwave amplifiers segment we currently expect annual sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment to be significantly lower in fiscal as compared to the record sales we achieved in fiscal in addition to the incremental sales we generated as a result of the radyne acquisition  sales in fiscal significantly benefited from our participation in the crew defense program which uses our broadband  solid state high power radio signal jamming amplifiers and switches in systems to help protect us troops from the ever evolving threat of radio controlled roadside bombs 
although we continue to see strong long term demand from the us government for our rf microwave amplifiers  we are currently anticipating lower crew related sales in fiscal sales and orders of our rf microwave amplifier products in fiscal are also expected to be suppressed by the same difficult economic and business conditions that we experienced in the second half of fiscal bookings  sales and profitability in our rf microwave amplifiers segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors  including the receipt of and performance on large contracts from the us government and international customers 
below is a summary of our aggregated business outlook on certain income statement line items our gross profit  as a percentage of our expected fiscal net sales  is expected to significantly decline from the percentage we achieved in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to changes in product mix 
in fiscal  a significant portion of our sales are expected to be for new mts ruggedized computers and mts systems that include new mts ruggedized computers 
these new mts computers are manufactured by a third party supplier and have significantly lower gross margins than prior mts computers 
as a result  gross margins in fiscal are expected to significantly decline as compared to prior periods and gross margins in any particular future period will be highly influenced by the ultimate quantity of mts ruggedized computers shipped in those periods 
in addition  our telecommunications transmission segment  which operates our high volume technology manufacturing center located in tempe  arizona  is expected to experience lower gross margins due to anticipated overall lower overhead absorption 
our selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of fiscal net sales  are expected to be significantly lower than fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in consolidated net sales that we expect to achieve in fiscal in addition  our selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to benefit from lower expenses associated with the fact that we are no longer offering video encoder and decoder products and we are no longer marketing fiberglass antennas to commercial broadcast customers 
we expect to continue to incur selling  general and administrative expenses associated with our selling and marketing efforts to the us army 
we believe that these efforts are necessary to help us secure follow on contracts to our current mts and bft contracts which expire in july and december  respectively 
research and development expenses  as a percentage of fiscal net sales  are expected to be lower than fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in consolidated net sales that we expect to achieve in fiscal during fiscal  we expect to continue to make investments in our backward compatible next generation mts and bft products  as well as other research and development efforts 
total amortization of stock based compensation which is allocated to cost of sales  selling  general and administrative and research and development expense line items in our consolidated statement of operations  for fiscal  is expected to be lower than in fiscal amortization of intangibles for fiscal is currently expected to be slightly lower than fiscal and  excluding the impact of any possible future acquisitions  is anticipated to approximate million 
interest income is expected to be lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the expectation of a continued low interest rate environment 
all of our available cash and cash equivalents are currently invested in commercial and government money market mutual funds  short term us treasury obligations and bank deposits  and currently yield a blended annual interest rate below interest expense is expected to significantly increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of million of our convertible senior notes 
although our convertible senior notes are no longer outstanding  as discussed further in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent accounting pronouncements  we will be required to retroactively adjust and present interest expense for fiscal and earlier periods 
our fiscal estimated effective income tax rate is expected to approximate as compared to in fiscal this increase is primarily related to our expected increase in pre tax income as well as the expiration of the federal research and experimentation credit on december  our ultimate effective income tax rate in fiscal depends on various factors including  but not limited to  future tax legislation enacted  the actual geographic composition of our revenue and pre tax income  the finalization of our irs audits  future acquisitions  and any future non deductible expenses 
as discussed above  we continue to operate our business in difficult market conditions 
although we remain confident in the long term demand drivers for our businesses  it remains difficult for us to forecast when business conditions will meaningfully improve 
in addition  if our current or prospective customers materially postpone  reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate  our business outlook will be adversely affected 
comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the year over year increase in net sales is primarily attributable to our acquisition of radyne which significantly benefited both our telecommunications transmission and rf microwave amplifiers segments 
as further discussed below  these increases were partially offset by a significant decline in shipments by our mobile data communications segment to the us army  pursuant to their request 
telecommunications transmission net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  an increase of million  or 
net sales in this segment reflect increased sales of our satellite earth station products  which were partially offset by lower sales of our over the horizon microwave systems 
sales of our over the horizon microwave systems were lower due to significantly lower direct sales to the us department of defense dod and lower indirect sales to algeria  our north african end customer 
sales of our satellite earth station products increased primarily due to incremental sales attributable to the radyne acquisition and incremental sales of our legacy branded satellite earth station modems which incorporate doubletalk carrier in carrier technology 
throughout fiscal  we were able to provide our customers and prospective customers the opportunity to purchase both comtech and or radyne branded products 
we believe that our strategy was well received by our customers 
because we have and continue to integrate and share technology including our doubletalk carrier in carrier technology across our product lines  we do not believe that sales performance comparisons between our individual brands are meaningful indicators of current or future performance 
we believe that difficult economic conditions  particularly in the second half of our fiscal  suppressed the overall reported net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment 
although historically nominal in the aggregate  sales of our smaller legacy product offerings embedded within our satellite earth station product line eg  voice gateways and data compression chips and our over the horizon microwave system product lines eg  fiberglass antennas declined as compared to fiscal sales of our video encoder and decoder products were significantly lower than expected as our commercial broadcasting customers experienced very difficult business conditions in their end markets 
in order to better focus our sales efforts in fiscal  in august  we announced that we sold our video encoder and decoder product line and ceased the marketing of fiberglass antennas to commercial broadcast customers 
aggregate sales of these products were approximately million in fiscal our telecommunications transmission segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal bookings  sales and profitability in our telecommunications transmission segment can fluctuate from period to period due to many factors including the book and ship nature associated with our satellite earth station products  the current adverse conditions in the global economy and credit markets  and the timing of  and our related performance on  contracts from the us government and international customers for our over the horizon microwave systems 
mobile data communications net sales in our mobile data communications segment were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
sales for fiscal include incremental sales relating to the design and manufacture of microsatellites and from mobile tracking products that incorporate sens technology which we acquired as part of our acquisition of radyne 
the year over year decline in mobile data communications segment sales is primarily attributable to lower sales of mobile satellite transceivers and related systems to the us army pursuant to both our mts and bft contracts  which  as further discussed below  is primarily attributable to timing imposed by the customer 
in january  we received a million purchase order from the us army for new mts third party produced ruggedized computers and related accessories 
this order is the single largest order received in our history 
in addition  in april  we received an order for million for the supply of mts systems which include both mobile satellite transceivers and mts third party ruggedized computers 
except for some nominal deliveries we made late in fiscal  the us army has requested these orders be delivered during fiscal sales to the mts program in fiscal were also impacted by the absence of mts sales for the army national guard that were specifically funded  in our fiscal  by a supplemental defense appropriations bill commonly referred to as the leahy bond amendment 
we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience future significant fluctuations in sales and orders related to the mts and bft programs 
as such  period to period comparisons of our results may not be indicative of a trend or future performance 
through july   we received million in total orders under our million mts contract  which expires in july  and million in total orders under our million bft contract  which expires in december given the current contract ceiling levels related to both our mts and bft contracts  we cannot obtain large future mts or bft orders unless the respective programs obtain contract ceiling increases or issue us new contract awards 
our mobile data communications segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal bookings  sales and profitability in our mobile data communications segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors  including unpredictable funding  deployment and technology decisions by the us government 
our mts and bft contracts are both idiq contracts and  as such  the us army is not obligated to purchase any equipment or services under these contracts 
we are aware that on occasion  the us government has experienced delays in the receipt of certain components that are eventually provided to us for incorporation into our mobile satellite transceivers or mobile data communications systems 
in addition  a substantial portion of our mobile data communications backlog as of july  includes orders relating to mts ruggedized computers which are manufactured by a third party supplier 
if we do not receive these us government furnished components or mts ruggedized computers in a timely manner  we could experience delays in fulfilling funded and anticipated orders from our customers 
rf microwave amplifiers net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment were million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a result of the radyne acquisition  we more than doubled our sales for fiscal in addition  net sales were higher due to increased sales of our legacy solid state  high power broadband amplifiers and high power switches that are incorporated into defense related systems  primarily sales associated with our participation in the counter remote control improvised explosive device electronic warfare crew program 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal bookings  sales and profitability in our rf microwave amplifiers segment can fluctuate from period to period due to many factors including the current adverse conditions in the global economy and credit markets  and the timing of  and our related performance on  contracts from the us government and international customers 
geography and customer type sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors of the us government represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
international sales which include sales to us companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
domestic commercial sales represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in consolidated net sales  discussed above  at significantly lower gross margins 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage in fiscal is primarily attributable to lower sales and lower production of mobile satellite transceivers which resulted in declines in gross profit percentages in both our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments 
as discussed further below  this was partially offset by an increase in gross profit percentage in our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
our telecommunications transmission segment experienced a significant decline in gross profit percentage during fiscal as compared to fiscal this decline is primarily attributable to a less favorable product mix including an overall decline in production of mobile satellite transceivers at our high volume technology manufacturing center located in tempe  arizona 
the impact of the lower production of mobile satellite transceivers  for our mobile data communications segment  resulted in lower net operating efficiencies primarily due to lower overhead absorption which more than offset the efficiencies we achieved as a result of our successful execution of our radyne related restructuring plan 
our mobile data communications segment experienced a significant decline in gross profit percentage during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower sales of mobile satellite transceivers 
significant period to period fluctuations in our gross margins can occur in our mobile data communications segment as a result of the nature  timing and mix of actual deliveries which are driven by the us army s requirements 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment experienced a higher gross profit percentage during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a more favorable product mix as a result of the radyne acquisition 
our rf microwave amplifier product line now includes satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifiers  which were sold at higher gross margins than those of our legacy product lines 
gross margins for our solid state  high power broadband amplifiers and switches  in fiscal  were negatively impacted by long production times relating of certain complex solid state  high power amplifiers and high power switches that employed newer technology 
these amplifiers were shipped in full during fiscal included in cost of sales for fiscal and are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
as discussed in our item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage assumptions 
included in the provision for fiscal is a million write down of inventory to net realizable value associated with our decision  in july  to no longer offer video encoder and decoder products or market fiberglass antennas to commercial broadcast customers 
in addition  included in cost of sales for fiscal is amortization of million related to the estimated fair value step up of radyne inventory acquired 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal include incremental spending associated with sales of radyne s products and services  an increase in professional fees primarily incurred in connection with legal and other matters that are disclosed in the caption set forth under notes to consolidated financial statements note c legal proceedings and other matters included in part ii
