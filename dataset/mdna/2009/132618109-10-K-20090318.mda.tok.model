item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general since its incorporation in  camco financial corporation camco or the corporation has evolved into a full service provider of financial products through its subsidiaries  advantage bank advantage or bank and camco title agency 
utilizing a common marketing theme based on camco s commitment to personalized customer service  camco has grown from million of consolidated assets in to billion of consolidated assets at december  camco s rate of growth is largely attributable to its acquisitions and its continued expansion of product lines from the limited deposit and loan offerings which the bank could offer in the heavily regulated environment of the s to the wider array of financial service products that commercial banks traditionally offer 
additionally  camco has enhanced its operational growth  to a lesser extent  by chartering a title insurance agency 
management believes that continued success in the financial services industry will be achieved by those institutions with a rigorous dedication to building value added customer oriented organizations 
toward this end  each of the bank s regions has the ability to make local decisions for customer contacts and services  however back office operations are consolidated and centralized 
based on consumer and business preferences  the bank s management designs financial service products with a view towards differentiating each of the constituent regions from its competition 
management believes that the bank regions ability to rapidly adapt to consumer and business needs and preferences is essential to them as community based financial institutions competing against the larger regional and money center bank holding companies 
camco s profitability depends primarily on its level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  principally loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and interest expense on deposit accounts and borrowings 
in recent years  camco s operations have also been heavily influenced by its level of other income  including mortgage banking income and other fee income 
camco s operations are also affected by general  administrative and other expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expense  data processing  franchise taxes  advertising  other operating expenses and federal income tax expense 

table of contents overview 
during  the economic environment for financial services companies continued to be disruptive and challenging 
we continued to execute our long term strategic plan to diversify the balance sheet by increasing our commercial  commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios and improve our funding mix by reducing borrowings and increasing transaction based deposits 
the following table summarizes our progress balance mix balance mix dollars in thousands loans residential real estate and multifamily nonresidential real estate and commercial home equity lines of credit and consumer construction deposits checking accounts money market and savings certificates federal home loan bank advances we have found that deposit growth continues to be challenging 
competition for deposits continues to put pressure on marginal funding costs  despite falling market rates in during fiscal  we were able to increase deposits 
however  the majority of the growth was certificates of deposit of which million related to brokered deposits 
the brokered deposits were attained to counter the reduction in borrowing capacity and to ensure we had access to funding in case we encountered significant losses or liquidity demands  and reduced borrowings further 
this strategy was defensive and had a negative impact on earnings as funds in excess of our borrowing reductions were not all deployed into loans or securities 
the real estate market in the midwest continues to create a very challenging environment for most financial institutions 
bankruptcies  foreclosures and unemployment have continued to rise in ohio 
we are working diligently to manage delinquencies and work with our loan customers in order to reduce losses for them  as well as our company 
the total loan portfolio decreased million for the full year of as we tightened credit standards and became more selective in underwriting new loans  which reduced new loan production coupled with the volatile market conditions and the current economic environment 
nonperforming loans increased to million at the end of compared to million at the end of we continued to see increases in nonperforming loans secured by residential real estate  but saw significant increases in nonperforming commercial real estate and land development loans 
we continue to deal with the economic challenges in our markets  through our loan charge offs and provision for loan losses as we recognize the results of these current economic conditions 
net charge offs totaled million during  we continue to aggressively work with borrowers to mitigate additional losses 
we believe we are taking significant steps forward in managing our operational efficiency 
we are continuing our focus on improving noninterest income and controlling noninterest expense by exiting unprofitable lines of business and refining our operations 
we continue to analyze new products to deepen relationships with our customers and improve the structure of our balance sheet

this md a is intended to give stockholders a more comprehensive review of the issues facing management than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes and the selected financial data elsewhere in this annual report

non gaap financial measures this report includes one or more non gaap financial measures within the meaning of regulation g 
with respect to each  camco has disclosed the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and reconciled the differences between the non gaap financial measure and the most comparable financial measure presented in accordance with gaap 
camco believes that the presentation of the non gaap financial measures in this report assist management and investors to compare results period to period in a more meaningful and consistent manner and provide a better measure of results for camco s ongoing operations 
critical accounting policies this md a  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this annual report  are based upon camco s consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires camco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or 
table of contents available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under us gaap 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and goodwill impairment 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses 
the procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses reflect our evaluation of credit risk after careful consideration and interpretation of relevant information available to us 
in developing this assessment  we must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries and issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results  which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is regularly reviewed by management to determine whether the amount is considered adequate to absorb probable  incurred losses 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans  statistical loss estimates for loan pools that are based on historical loss experience  and general loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions 
also considered as part of that judgment is a review of the bank s trends in delinquencies and loan losses  as well as trends in delinquencies and losses for the region and nationally  and economic factors 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes to be adequate to absorb probable  incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet dates presented 
our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is an estimate based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
while we strive to reflect all known risk factors in our evaluations  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
mortgage servicing rights 
to determine the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights msrs each reporting quarter  we transmit information to a third party provider who assists us with determining the possible impairment of msrs  as described below 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
a pooling methodology to the servicing valuation  in which loans with similar characteristics are pooled together  is applied for valuation purposes 
once pooled  each grouping of loans is evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings that a purchaser could expect to realize from the portfolio 
earnings are projected from a variety of sources including loan service fees  interest earned on float  net interest earned on escrow balances  miscellaneous income and costs to service the loans 
the present value of future earnings is the estimated market value for the pool  calculated using consensus assumptions that a third party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the servicing 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the interest rate for float  which we estimate  takes into consideration the investment portfolio average yield as well as current short duration investment yields 
we believe this methodology provides a reasonable estimate 
mortgage loan prepayment speeds are calculated by the third party provider utilizing industry standards in estimating prepayment speeds and provides a specific scenario with each evaluation 
based on the assumptions discussed  pre tax projections are prepared for each pool of loans serviced 
these earning figures approximate the cash flow that could be received from the servicing portfolio 
valuation results are presented quarterly to management 
at that time  we review the information and msrs are marked to the lower of amortized cost or fair value for the current quarter 
goodwill 
we have developed procedures to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis using june financial information 
this testing procedure is performed with the assistance of a third party that evaluates possible impairment based on the following the test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities  identified intangible assets and goodwill to a reporting unit and comparing the fair value of this reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
the value 
table of contents is determined assuming a freely negotiated transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller  neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts 
accordingly  to derive the fair value of the reporting unit  the following common approaches to valuing business combination transactions involving financial institutions are utilized by a third party selected by camco the comparable transactions approach specifically based on earnings  book  assets and deposit premium multiples received in recent sales of comparable thrift franchises  and the discounted cash flow approach 
the application of these valuation techniques takes into account the reporting unit s operating history  the current market environment and future prospects 
as of the most recent quarter  the only reporting unit carrying goodwill is the bank 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and no second step is required 
if not  a second test is required to measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
the second test of the overall goodwill impairment compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the impairment loss shall equal the excess of carrying value over fair value 
after each testing period  the third party compiles a summary of the test that is then provided to the audit and risk management committee of the board of directors for review 
as of the most recent testing date  september   and utilizing subsequent events through december   the fair value of the reporting unit was considered fully impaired and goodwill was written off as of december  summary 
we believe the accounting estimates related to the allowance for loan losses  the capitalization  amortization  and valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the goodwill impairment test are critical accounting estimates because the estimates are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require us to make assumptions concerning the changes in the types and volumes of the portfolios  rates of future prepayments  and anticipated economic conditions  and the impact of recognizing an impairment or loan loss could have a material effect on camco s assets reported on the balance sheet as well as its net earnings 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit and risk management committee of the board of directors and they have reviewed camco s disclosures relating to such matters in this md a 
discussion of financial condition changes from december  to december  at december   camco s consolidated assets totaled billion  a decrease of million  or  from the december  total 
the decrease in total assets was comprised primarily of decreases in loans receivable offset partially by the increase in securities and cash and cash equivalents 
we expect total asset growth to be limited in the near term as the unemployment rates continue to rise and the economy continues to struggle 
further deterioration of the residential loan market in the midwest may result in a shift in the loan portfolio toward commercial and consumer loans 
the current decrease in loan rates may contribute to additional profits relating to the sale of fixed rate loans 
future growth in deposits would most likely be used to reduce outstanding borrowings and brokered deposits 
we continue to believe that the distressed economic environment is expected to continue the reduction in the demand for new loan growth in cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions totaled million at december  an increase of million  or  from december  levels 
this increase is reflective of our decision to improve our liquidity position in securities totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from the total at december  investment security purchases totaled million  principal repayments totaling million  sales of million and an increase in the fair market value of securities available for sale of million 
the yield on securities purchased during the period was approximately of the portfolio is expected to mature or prepay during we have kept the duration and average life of the securities portfolio very short in order to provide liquidity and to reduce borrowings  when available 
at december   other than  of municipal bonds  all of our debt securities were issued and guaranteed by us government sponsored enterprises such as freddie mac  fannie mae  ginnie mae and the federal home loan banks 
we held no private label mortgage backed securities or collateralized debt obligations 

table of contents loans receivable and loans held for sale totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the total at december  the decrease resulted primarily from repayments of million and loan sales of million  partially offset by loan disbursements and purchases totaling million coupled with the increased provision relating to our allowance for loan and leases 
loan origination volume  including purchases of loans  was less than that of the comparable period by million  or  while the volume of loan sales decreased by million year to year 
the number of loans originated for sale in the secondary market continued to decline as unprecedented disruptions in the residential real estate market significantly slowed home sales and new home construction 
instead of selling adjustable rate loans  we have typically held adjustable rate mortgage loans for investment as an integral part of our strategy to manage interest rate risk 
loan originations during the month period were comprised primarily of million in commercial loans  million of loans secured by one to four family residential real estate and million in consumer and other loans 
our intent is to continue to expand consumer and commercial real estate lending in future periods as a means of increasing the yield on our loan portfolio and continue with our strategic plan of moving to a more bank like institution 
in the near term  however  lending volumes of acceptable risk have diminished somewhat due to a slowing economy and loan repayments have been used to reduce borrowings and build liquidity 
during the fourth quarter of  the yield on loans was  and the portfolio mix continued to shift to higher yielding consumer and commercial loans 
this shift is partially offsetting lower effective rates in the loan portfolio during due to rapidly falling interest rates  primarily the prime rate 
at december   approximately of our loan portfolio had interest rates tied to the prime rate and of our loan portfolio was fixed rate 
loan portfolio balances fell million  or during the year with conventional mortgage loans comprising of this decrease 
the overall loan portfolio decreased for the full year of as we continued to tighten credit standards and became more selective in underwriting new loans  which significantly reduced new loan production coupled with economic challenges in our markets  particularly in the market for residential real estate 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  representing and of nonperforming loans at those dates 
nonperforming loans three months or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  constituting and of total net loans  including loans held for sale  at those dates 
net charge offs totaled million for and were comprised mainly of family loans and construction and commercial and industrial loans 
the following table details delinquent and nonaccrual loans at december  and december  december  days days days delinquent  days delinquent  delinquent accruing nonaccrual delinquent accruing nonaccrual in thousands construction development heloc and second mortgage family multifamily commercial consumer and other total although we believe that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover probable  incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date based upon the available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary in future periods  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
unemployment rates in our markets  and ohio in general  are higher than the national average 
ohio was registered the nation s seventh highest state foreclosure rate in additionally  
table of contents ohio is experiencing declining values of residential real estate 
however  ohio in general has not experienced significant increases in home values over the past five years like many regions in the us  which should comparatively mitigate losses on loans 
nonetheless  these factors  compounded by a very uncertain national economic outlook  may continue to increase the level of future losses beyond our current expectations 
deposits totaled million at december  an increase of million  or from december  the following table details our deposit portfolio balances and the average rate paid on our deposit portfolio at december   and december  december  december  change balance rate balance rate balance rate in thousands noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand money market savings certificates of deposit retail certificates of deposit brokered total deposits the increase in certificates of deposits was due to increases in brokered deposits which were used to reduce borrowings and improve the bank s liquidity position 
however  we acknowledge that brokered deposits are not core  franchise enhancing deposits  and we do not intend to stray from our strategy of improving the long term funding mix of the bank s deposit portfolio by aggregating small business  commercial and retail checking accounts 
we have implemented a number of organizational and product development initiatives including a new suite of commercial and small business checking accounts  enhancements to our online business cash management system  and the launch of remote deposit capture solution 
the increase in retail certificates of deposits is due to customers showing preference toward higher yielding interest rates 
we have reduced the rates offered on our money markets in due to the prime rate decreasing 
we also believe that if we are able to maintain the certificates of deposit maturing in the decreased rates will help to further reduce our cost of funds 
to reduce interest rate risk over the long term  we will increase our efforts to lengthen the duration of our deposit structure and our fhlb borrowings 
we anticipate using brokered deposits in early in order to improve the bank s liquidity position 
however  we acknowledge that brokered deposits are not core  franchise enhancing deposits  and we do not intend to stray from our strategy of improving the long term funding mix of the bank s deposit portfolio by aggregating small business  commercial and retail checking accounts 
to that end  we will continue our initiatives of increasing our commercial and small business checking accounts  enhancements to our online business cash management system  and the launch of a remote deposit capture solution 
we believe these products will help us be more competitive for business checking accounts 
see liquidity and capital resources in this md a for further discussion on our deposit strategy and additional liquidity risks 
advances from the fhlb and other borrowings decreased by million  or  to a total of million at december  we were able to reduce borrowings as a result of the increased deposits of million and a net decrease in the loan portfolio of million these decreases also gave us the ability to increase cash balances at december  by million to improve the bank s liquidity position 
we plan to continue to reduce fhlb advances further when possible in stockholders equity totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or from december  the decrease resulted primarily from a net loss of million  dividends of million and an adjustment to retained earnings for the adoption of a new accounting standard regarding split dollar life insurance benefits totaling  in addition  decreasing interest rates increased the fair value of our investments

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  general 
camco s net loss for the year ended december   totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from the million of net income reported in the decrease in earnings was primarily due to the additional million in the provision for loan losses  coupled with a million in goodwill impairment charges  impairment of million in mortgage servicing rights  million relating to write down of real estate owned and  expenses relating to the termination of the first place financial corporation merger which was offset partially by a million decrease in the provision for federal taxes 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  compared to  generally reflecting the effects of a million decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets 
net interest margin fell to for the twelve months ending december  compared to for the comparable period in the compression in net interest margin during the period  compared to the same period of  was due  nearly equally  to a lower volume of interest earning assets and a lower yield on those assets offset partially by lower cost of interest bearing liabilities in the period 
margin pressure is due to the yield on assets declining at a faster rate than the cost of funds 
at the same time  the loan portfolio has not grown sufficiently to offset the tighter spreads to result in higher net interest income 
while loan production has slowed  we continue to diversify the loan portfolio by encouraging continued growth in commercial and consumer loan balances as these types of loans are normally higher yielding assets than adjustable rate mortgage loans 
interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the comparable total 
the decrease resulted primarily from a basis point decrease in the average yield  from in  to in  coupled with a million  or  decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding year to year

continued decreases in the prime rate has compressed our net interest margin due to the lag in re pricing between our loan and deposit portfolios 
at the same time  the loan portfolio has not grown to offset these tighter spreads 
as noted earlier  we plan to continue to diversify the loan portfolio by encouraging growth in 
table of contents commercial and consumer loan balances 
this strategy should slow net interest margin compression as these types of loans are normally higher yielding assets than conventional mortgage loans and investment securities 
provision for losses on loans 
a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the bank  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to the bank s market areas  and other factors related to the collectability of the bank s loan portfolio 
based upon an analysis of these factors  management recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling million for the year ended december   an increase of million  from the provision recorded in the increase in provision was due to economic conditions relating to higher unemployment statistics  increasing foreclosures in ohio and increased charge offs which was coupled with increased classified assets 
other income 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to a million decrease in the value of our mortgage servicing rights coupled with a  decrease in title fee and rent and other income 
the decrease in mortgage servicing rights was due to increased volatility in the market  which in turn increased the prepayment speeds utilized to value the portfolio 
at december   we serviced million of one to four family residential mortgage loans for others  primarily freddie mac and fannie mae  which declined from million at december  the decrease in rent and other income for was due to a decrease in loan prepayment penalties of  coupled with decreased income from our title insurance agency which fell  in due to the significant slowdown in home sales and related mortgage loan volume

general  administrative and other expense totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase was due primarily to a million impairment charge taken on goodwill coupled with the write down of real estate owned properties of million and  in merger and acquisition related charges 
core noninterest expense excluding merger and goodwill impairment charges totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of  or increase 
the increase in core non interest expense was primarily due to increased fdic premiums and the write down of real estate owned which were partially offset by decreases in advertising  supplies  travel and training and loan and deposit expenses 
the goodwill impairment charge is reflective of the most recent testing valuation as of september   and utilizing subsequent events through december   which indicated the fair value of the reporting unit was fully impaired as of december  the increase in fdic premiums resulted from increases in premium rates and deposit balances along with the decreased credits issuances in relating to the reorganization of the deposit insurance fund assessment of premiums by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
the increase in real estate owned and other expense is reflective of falling real estate values that negatively impacted our portfolio value and caused a write down to fair market value coupled with additional properties taken in to real estate owned due to foreclosures in approximately one of every households in ohio were in foreclosure at december  additionally  as noted earlier  home values in ohio have continued to decline from previous levels 
these factors  compounded by an uncertain economic outlook and increasing unemployment  may result in continued expenses in this was coupled with additional costs relating to bank paid pmi insurance linked to a new product offering in while advertising  supplies and travel and training expenses have decreased  it is not foreseeable that they will continue to be at these lower levels due to much of the decrease was related to the announced merger with first place that was terminated november federal income taxes

based upon an analysis of these factors  management recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  from the provision recorded in other income 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to the increase in other income was primarily attributable to a  decrease in the net amortization of mortgage servicing rights  a  increase in service charges and other fees on deposits 
in fourth quarter of  we updated some of the assumptions used in estimating the value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
we reduced the estimated cost to service a loan and we reduced the estimated ancillary income to be earned per loan 
as a result  we recorded impairment on capitalized mortgage servicing rights in excluding the impairment  amortization increased  and income from new servicing rights decreased  during the increase in service charges and other fees on deposits was primarily due to increased service  overdraft and non sufficient fund fees and more checking accounts in initiatives to increase fee collection and improve the company s current fee structure are being implemented to place more emphasis on this vital revenue stream 
changes in rent and other income in was due to an increase in loan prepayment penalties of  and an increase in surcharge and interchange income from automated teller machine atm activity of  other income from our title insurance agency fell  in due to the significant slowdown in home sales and related mortgage loan volume

the increase in employee compensation and benefits is due to several key hires within mid management of the corporation  including commercial lenders 
loan collection staff was hired in to improve our monitoring and collection of delinquent loans 
the company has launched two banking offices since the third quarter of  which increased personnel expenses in we combined two of our retail banking regions and closed two loan production offices in the third quarter of while these closings are expected to decrease compensation expense in the future  one time severance costs related to closings totaled  in these increases were offset partially by the adjustment of a post retirement accrual due to the departure of a member of senior management in june the occupancy and equipment expense increase is primarily due to the opening of two banking offices located in mason and london  ohio 
advertising is also higher in as a result of the banking office launches coupled with new deposit products and direct mail campaigns 
management has undertaken a branch merchandising program to standardize and improve the look and feel  and ultimately the sales process in the bank s offices 
the increase in deposit expenses was primarily due to correspondent bank service charges and transaction account expenses 

table of contents while expenses have increased due to the addition of a number of revenue producing positions and the opening of two banking offices  we believe these investments in personnel and property are imperative to camco s growth strategy 
however  when new banking offices are opened  some time is needed to absorb the cost and create more revenue in these new markets 
data processing expense is lower in as the bank underwent a core processing conversion in we have also implemented cost saving initiatives in our telecommunications and information technology services 
the increase in loan expenses was primarily due to a charge of  taken during related to the repurchase of million of residential real estate loans and a  increase in insurance premiums for private mortgage and collateral loss insurance on our mortgage and home equity loans 
the increase in real estate owned and other expenses was due to higher levels of foreclosures in  which increased maintenance expenses on those properties and due to write downs of real estate owned coupled with the net loss on real estate acquired through foreclosure can be attributed primarily to a  loss on a single commercial property that secured a loan to which we were a participant 
we were unable to directly control the actions of the bank that originated the loan and subsequently executed a sale of that property 
excluding this single event  we realized a net gain on the sale of foreclosed real estate of  in this reflects the diligence of our credit administration team to mitigate losses on foreclosures 
however  approximately of the households in ohio were in foreclosure at december   an increase of from december  additionally  as noted earlier  home values in ohio are declining from levels 
these factors  compounded by an uncertain economic outlook and increasing unemployment  may result in higher losses on real estate acquired through foreclosure in and beyond 
we also commenced the amortization of our investment in affordable housing partnerships 
we receive tax credits and other tax benefits through our investment in these partnerships 
federal income taxes 
federal income tax totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  compared to the provision recorded in the effective tax rates amounted to and for the years ended december  and  respectively

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity is essential to our business 
our primary funding source is customer deposits which may be directly affected by the economy 
with the significant downturn in economic conditions our customers in general have experienced reduced funds available to deposit in their bank 
our customer relationship deposit balances fell approximately million over the course of as a result  the company has increased its use of wholesale funding including brokered deposits 
in response to the adverse economic conditions  the company has been  and will continue to work toward  reducing the amount of nonperforming assets  adjusting the balance sheet by reducing loan totals and other assets as possible  reducing controllable operating costs  and augmenting deposits while striving to maximize secured borrowing facilities to improve liquidity and preserve capital over the course of however  the company s inability to successfully implement its plans or further deterioration in economic conditions and real estate prices could still have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
camco is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is from dividends received from the bank 
such dividends arise from the cash flow and earnings of the bank 
banking regulations and authorities may limit the amount or require certain approvals of the dividend that the bank may pay to camco 
camco currently has million outstanding trust preferred securities with a maturity date of if needed camco s contract provides for a deferment of up to consecutive quarters without default 
if the company desires to raise funds in the future the company may consider engaging in further offerings of preferred securities  debentures or other borrowings as well as issuance of capital stock  but any such strategic decisions would require regulatory approval 
the objective of the bank s liquidity management is to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals  fund the borrowing needs of loan customers  and to fund ongoing operations 
core relationship deposits are the primary source of the bank s liquidity 
as such  the bank focuses on deposit relationships with local business and consumer clients with a strategy to increase the number of services products per client 
the company views such deposits as the foundation of its long term liquidity because it believes such core deposits are more stable and less sensitive to changing interest rates and other economic factors compared to large time deposits or wholesale purchased funds 
over the past several quarters customer relationship deposits have declined in tandem with the slowing economy 
accordingly the bank has increased its overall use of wholesale funding sources and anticipates that such will be the case until the economy rebounds 
we monitor and assess liquidity needs daily in order to meet deposit withdrawals  loan commitments and expenses 
camco s liquidity contingency funding plan identifies liquidity thresholds and red flags that may evidence liquidity concerns or future crises 
the contingency plan details specific actions to be taken by management and the board of directors 
it also identifies sources of emergency liquidity  both asset and liability based  should we encounter a liquidity crisis 
in conjunction with the corporation s asset liability and interest rate risk management activities  we actively monitor liquidity risk and analyze various scenarios that could impact or impair camco s ability to access emergency funding during a liquidity crisis 
liquid assets consist of cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  investments and mortgage backed securities 
approximately million  or  of our investment portfolio is expected to mature or prepay during while these maturities could provide a significant source of liquidity in the short term  public unit deposits and repurchase agreements limit our ability to use these funds freely due to the collateral requirements of such 
state and local political subdivision deposits equaled million at december   and million at december  we may implement additional product strategies to lessen this restriction on our investment portfolio to increase our liquidity options 
additional sources of liquidity include deposits  borrowings and principal and interest repayments on loans 
while scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable  deposit flows and early loan and security prepayments are more influenced by interest rates  general economic conditions  and competition and are difficult to predict 
diversified and reliable sources of wholesale funds are utilized to augment core deposit funding 
borrowings may be used on a long or short term basis to compensate for reduction in other sources of funds or on a long term 
table of contents basis to support lending activities 
the bank utilizes its investment securities  certain loans and fhlb stock to provide collateral to support its borrowing needs 
management believes that its focus on core relationship deposits coupled with access to borrowing through reliable counterparties provides reasonable and prudent assurance that ample liquidity is available 
however  depositor or counterparty behavior could change in response to competition  economic or market situations or other unforeseen circumstances  which could have liquidity implications that may require different strategic or operational actions 
one source of wholesale funding is brokered deposits 
consistent with its risk management policy and in response to the general tightening of credit and liquidity conditions in the financial markets at large  the bank recently increased its use of brokered deposits 
at december   such deposits totaled approximately million  exclusive of cdars deposits 
approximately million of the corporation s certificate of deposit portfolio is scheduled to mature during depositors continue a preference toward short term certificates or other issuances less than months 
this places additional liquidity pressure on the corporation as competition for deposits is very strong in ohio  kentucky and west virginia 
a material loss of these short term deposits could force us to seek funding through contingency sources  which may negatively impact earnings 
federal home loan bank fhlb advances are another funding source 
in the past  camco has depended heavily on borrowings to fund balance sheet growth 
while significant strategic and tactical focus is currently being placed on deposit growth  borrowings and additional borrowing capacity at the fhlb are still vital sources of liquidity and growth funding 
we have approximately million of additional borrowing capacity available as of december  however  our total borrowing capacity at the fhlb is dependent on the level of eligible collateral assets held by the bank and the bank s credit rating with the fhlb 
our total borrowing capacity with the fhlb decreased to million at december   from million at december  this capacity has decreased as our one to four family loan portfolio  the primary collateral for fhlb borrowings  has shrunk and the increase in nonperforming loans has reduced our credit rating and thereby increased its collateral requirements in compared to the inability of the bank to access contingency funding from the fhlb may significantly limit our growth and negatively affect earnings 
we have improved on balance sheet liquidity and in response to higher collateral maintenance requirements and decreases in our overall borrowing capacity 
we plan to continue to monitor our funding sources through brokered deposits and fhlb borrowings  but recognized that our current credit risk profile may restrict these sources 
our funds management group will monitor the deposit rates in our markets to allow for competitive pricing in order to raise funds through deposits 
funds in excess of loan demand and available borrowing repayments will be held in short term investments or federal funds sold 
we are taking these actions to proactively prepare for the possibility of continued deterioration in the credit markets and increases in our nonperforming loans  which may reduce our borrowing capacity at the fhlb further 

table of contents the following table sets forth information regarding the bank s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contract as of december  payments due by period less than more than year years years years total in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations advances from the federal home loan bank repurchase agreements certificates of deposit subordinated debentures ohio equity funds for affordable housing amount of commitments per period commitments to originate loans revolving  open end lines family residential construction commercial real estate  other construction loan and land development loans other unused commitments stand by letters of credit total contractual obligations the subordinated debentures are redeemable at par  at camco s option  commencing september  the debentures mature on september  we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan commitments 
based upon historical deposit flow data  the bank s competitive pricing in its market and management s experience  we believe that a significant portion of our maturing certificates of deposit in will remain with the bank  but recognize the significance of the risks discussed above 
we engage in off balance sheet credit related activities that could require us to make cash payments in the event that specified future events occur 
the contractual amounts of these activities represent the maximum exposure to the bank as further described in financial statement footnote note i commitments 
however  certain off balance sheet commitments are expected to expire or be only partially used  therefore  the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
these off balance sheet activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of the bank s customers 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term management process 
in the event that we should require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  additional funds are available through the use of fhlb advances  brokered deposits  and through the sales of loans and or securities 
ohio statutes impose certain limitations on the payment of dividends and other capital distributions by banks 
generally  absent approval of the superintendent of banks  such statutes limit dividend and capital distributions to earnings of the current and two preceding years 
as a result of entering into a memorandum of understanding with the frb on march   we are prohibited from paying dividends to our stockholders without first obtaining the approval of the frb 
additionally  our ability to pay dividends to stockholders is dependent on our net earnings 
a continued decline in earnings increases in loan losses  or higher regulatory capital reserve requirements may jeopardize our ability to pay dividends at current or historical levels 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions  levels of market interest rates  and by competition  and in addition  our community banking focus makes our results from operations particularly dependent on the ohio economy 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting our earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from changes in interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
our asset liability management objective is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within the board s policy limits 
this objective is accomplished through management of balance sheet composition  liquidity  and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions  interest rates and customer preferences 
we maintain an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by setting tolerance levels for the net interest margin scenario changes developed simulation models under different interest rate scenarios to measure the risk to earnings over the next month period 
the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan demand or unexpected deposit withdrawals 
this is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of investment securities  maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity and achieving consistent growth in core deposits 
during in an effort to maintain higher levels of liquidity  we held larger cash balances on the balance sheet and limited our short term investments understanding the affect on earnings 
these efforts resulted from the ever growing competition for deposits and our credit ratings affect on our fhlb borrowing capacity and the need provide funding and deposit maturities 
we plan to return to our strategy of short term investments while monitoring all of our various funding sources 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional discussion on liquidity 
we consider interest rate risk to be camco s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of camco s net interest income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
we employ an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes management projections for activity levels in each of the product lines offered 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
assumptions are inherently uncertain and the measurement of net interest income or the impact of rate fluctuations on net interest income cannot be precisely predicted 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the bank s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the bank s board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
the interest rate risk position of camco presented below is determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a month horizon assuming an instantaneous and parallel shift linear increase or decrease in all interest rates 
for example  the tables below assume that a decrease in market rates of basis points will result in an immediate reduction of our money market deposit accounts rates of basis points 
competitive pressures such as the environment we are in currently  may limit our ability to actually reduce money market rates by basis points 
the table below also includes assumptions on loan production and deposit growth over the next months 
actual results may significantly differ from those presented below due to the assumption based nature of the model 

table of contents the following table shows the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in percentage change in interest rates net interest income basis points months the current simulation identifies a decreasing net interest income in a declining rate environment 
a contributing factor to this decline is the existing higher prepayment speeds incorporated into our model at year end along with decreased interest revenue due to higher non performing loans when compared to its funding sources 
in a rising rate environment our net interest income increases due to the decrease refinance opportunities and the significant amount of adjustable rate loans tied to prime rate within our loan portfolio 
these assets will adjust faster than liabilities due to the lagging nature of adjustments in out deposit base 
these estimated changes in net interest income are within the policy guidelines established by the board of directors with the exception of the basis point rate decrease 
we expect that an improvement in our overall non performing loans will increase interest revenue and allow this metric to comply with the required thresholds 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity  we have developed sale procedures for several types of interest sensitive assets 
generally  all long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to freddie mac and fannie guidelines are sold upon origination 
a total of million and million of such loans were sold to freddie mac  fannie mae and other parties during and  respectively
