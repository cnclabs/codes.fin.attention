item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview baldor is a leading manufacturer of industrial electric motors  drives  generators  and other mechanical power transmission products  currently supplying over  customers in more than industries 
our products are sold to a diverse customer base consisting of original equipment manufacturers and distributors serving markets in the united states and throughout the world 
we focus on providing customers with value through a combination of quality products and customer service  as well as short lead times and attractive total cost of ownership  which takes into account initial product cost  product life  maintenance costs and energy consumption 

table of contents on january   baldor completed the acquisition of reliance from rockwell 
reliance was a leading manufacturer of industrial electric motors  and other mechanical power transmission products 
the acquisition extended baldor s product offerings  provided a manufacturing base in china for the asian markets  increased the company s manufacturing capabilities and flexibility  strengthened the management team  and provided strong opportunities for synergies and cost savings 
reliance s results of operations were included in the consolidated financial statements beginning february  on august   baldor acquired poulies maska  inc maska of ste claire  quebec  canada 
the purchase price was million which was funded with cash and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
maska is a designer  manufacturer and marketer of sheaves  bushings  couplings and related mechanical power transmission components 
the acquisition gives baldor a second plant in both canada and china and expands the company s market share of sheaves and bushings in north america 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of maska beginning august  generally  our financial performance is driven by industrial spending and the strength of the economies in which we sell our products  and is also influenced by investments in manufacturing capacity  including upgrades  modifications  and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities  and the creation of new manufacturing facilities  our customers needs for greater variety  timely delivery  and higher quality at a competitive cost  and our large installed base  which creates a significant replacement demand 
we are not dependent on any one industry or customer for our financial performance  and no single customer represented more than of our net sales for the years ended january   december   and december  for the years ended january   december   and december   domestic net sales generated through distributors  representing primarily sales of replacement products  amounted to   and  respectively 
domestic sales to oems were approximately   and  respectively  for the same periods 
oems primarily use our products in new installations 
this expands our installed base and leads to replacement product sales through distributors in the future 
we manufacture substantially all of our products 
consequently  our costs include the cost of raw materials  including steel  copper and aluminum  and energy costs 
each of these costs has increased in the past few years due to growing global demand for these commodities  impacting our cost of sales 
we seek to offset these increases through a continued focus on product design improvements  including redesigning our products to reduce material content and investing in capital equipment that assists in eliminating waste  hedging of certain raw material prices  and by modest price increases in our products 
our manufacturing facilities are also significant sources of fixed costs 
our margin is impacted to the extent we cannot promptly decrease these costs to match declines in net sales 

table of contents industry trends the demand for products in the industrial electric motor  generator  and mechanical power transmission industries is closely tied to growth trends in the economy and levels of industrial activity and capital investment 
we believe that specific drivers of demand for our products include process automation  efforts in energy conservation and productivity improvement  regulatory and safety requirements  new technologies and replacement of worn parts 
our products are typically critical parts of customers end applications  and the end user s cost associated with their failure is high 
consequently  we believe that end users of our products base their purchasing decisions on quality  reliability and availability as well as customer service  rather than the price alone 
we believe key success factors in our industry include strong reputation and brand preference  good customer service and technical support  product availability  and a strong distribution network 
the current economic recession impacted our business levels in the second half of while order rates remained steady in the third quarter we began to see some slowing 
that trend continued in the fourth quarter and order rates decreased sharply in december as distributors aggressively reduced inventories and oem customers extended holiday shutdowns 
we expect to be challenging and we have taken steps to prepare for reduced business levels in the coming year 
we remain focused on managing production and inventory levels and are adjusting them proactively as incoming order rates change 
our manufacturing systems and proximity to our customers allow us to adjust inventories up or down quickly as incoming order rates change 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we implemented cost reduction initiatives across the company  and we are accelerating integration projects related to our recent acquisitions 
we expect to achieve approximately million in cost savings in as a result of these initiatives 
we have also implemented sales strategies targeted to obtain specifically identified new customers in our broad product offering and manufacturing flexibility allows us to serve new customers quickly when business from our existing customers slows 
we successfully executed a similar strategy during the last recessionary period and many of the customers we obtained then are still customers today 
results of operations compared to net sales for the year increased to billion  compared to billion in sales of industrial electric motor products grew for the year as compared to industrial electric motors comprised of total sales for the year compared to for sales of mounted bearings  gearing  and other mechanical power transmission products  including four months sales of million from our maska acquisition  grew over and accounted for of total sales compared to in sales of other products  including generators  drives  and metal stampings  decreased from prior year and comprised of total sales for the year compared to in sales of super e premium efficient motors continue to grow at a faster pace than standard efficiency motors  increasing more than in and comprising approximately of current motor product sales 
even in a challenging economic period  customers realize premium efficient motors reduce their electricity costs 
additionally  our wide variety of super e motors already comply with the energy bill requirements which will become effective in december our oem customers will continue to convert to premium efficient motors in in order to have equipment tested and compliant with the energy bill requirements by the effective date 
gross profit margin decreased slightly to in compared to in and operating profit margin decreased to in from in raw materials costs 
table of contents were substantially higher in than in while the increased costs were partially offset by product design improvements and price increases implemented during the year  margins were negatively impacted in selling and administrative expenses increased slightly as a percentage of sales in primarily due to increased commission expense as we integrated the reliance motor products into our sales network  and the inclusion of maska expenses beginning august  interest expense decreased million from even though there was a full year of interest expense in related to the debt incurred on january  to fund our acquisition of reliance  compared to eleven months of interest in interest rates on our variable rate debt decreased in and we reduced our outstanding debt balance by a net amount of million during the year 
pre tax income of million for increased compared to pre tax income of million 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in the change was primarily related to increased earnings generated outside the united states and the domestic production activities deduction 
we expect our effective tax rate to range from to in net income of million for the year increased from net income of million 
diluted earnings per common share grew to compared to in average diluted shares outstanding was million for compared to million for compared to net sales for increased to billion  compared to million in sales for included million related to the inclusion of reliance results of operations beginning february  sales of industrial electric motor products grew during as compared to and comprised of total product sales in compared to in mounted bearings  gearings  and other mechanical power transmission products accounted for approximately of total sales for  compared to for sales of other products  including drives and generators  decreased as compared to and comprised of total product sales in compared to in motors and other products declined as a percentage of total sales in due to increased sales of mechancial power transmission products  primarily resulting from the acquisition of reliance 
gross profit improved to in compared to in and operating profit impoved to in from in our continued focus on product design improvements  along with a modest price increase on our products  helped to offset higher raw material prices 
these initiatives  along with increased sales volume and efficiencies in overhead  contributed to improved margins for the year

net income of million for the year increased from net income of million 
diluted earnings per common share grew by to compared to in the effective tax rate for was compared to in average diluted shares outstanding was million for compared to million for the increase in outstanding shares was primarily attributable to shares issued in connection with the acquisition of reliance 

table of contents environmental remediation we believe  based on our internal reviews and other factors  that any future costs relating to environmental remediation and compliance will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  cash flows  or competitive position 
financial position during  we continued to invest in research and development for new and existing products  make capital investments in our manufacturing facilities and information systems  expand into new markets  and invest in both our employees and customers education and training 
we believe the investment in our employees through training and education is a key to continued success and improved shareholder value 
investments in property  plant and equipment  and information systems amounted to million in  million in  and million in these investments were made primarily to improve quality and productivity 
our commitment to research and development continues to help us maintain a leadership position in the marketplace and satisfy customers needs 
investments in research and development amounted to million in  million in  and million in we continue to make investments in new product development as well as in existing products for improved performance  increased energy efficiency  and manufacturability 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and funds available under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
we expect that ongoing requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  dividends  and debt service will be adequately funded from these sources 
at january   we had approximately million of borrowing capacity under the senior secured revolving credit facility which matures in the current financial market conditions have not affected our lenders ability to fund borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
cash flows from operations amounted to million in  million in and million in during  we made two semi annual interest payments on the senior unsecured notes compared to a single semi annual payment in  decreasing operating cash flows by million 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we funded margin deposits on our commodity hedges as a result of sharply declining copper prices  decreasing operating cash flows by approximately million 
we will recover these deposits related to hedge positions held at january  as the positions settle during when comparing to  operating cash flows increased due to the inclusion of reliance results of operations beginning february   and normal fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities related to overall results of operations 
during  we utilized cash flows from operations and accumulated cash to fund property  plant and equipment additions of million  pay dividends of million to our shareholders  and fund million of debt repayments

investing activities in 
table of contents included  million net of cash acquired used to acquire reliance on january  the acquisition was funded with proceeds from the issuance of baldor common stock and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and senior unsecured notes 
in addition  included proceeds from the divestiture of certain us service centers amounting to million 
financing activities in included dividends paid to shareholders of million and net debt reductions of million 
during  we made principal payments totalling approximately million on our term loan and notes payable and we had borrowings on our revolving credit facility of approximately million and million to fund the acquisition of maska and margin deposits on our commodity hedges  respectively 
financing activities in included billion of proceeds from new debt incurred net of repayments and equity issued in the acquisition of reliance  and dividends paid to shareholders of million 
net cash used in financing activities of million in included common stock repurchases of million and dividends paid to shareholders of million 
total outstanding debt was billion at january   compared to billion at december  we have senior secured debt ratings of ba with a negative outlook by moody s investors services  inc moody s and bb with a negative outlook by standard poor s rating service s p 
we have senior unsecured debt ratings of b by moody s and b by s p 
both ratings agencies recently affirmed our ratings and downgraded their outlook from stable to negative  primarily due to current market conditions 
we have no downward rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of amounts drawn or increase the interest rates paid under our senior secured credit facility and our senior unsecured notes 
our senior secured credit facility and senior unsecured notes contain various customary covenants  which limit  among other things  indebtedness and dispositions of assets  and which require us to maintain compliance with certain quarterly financial ratios 
the primary financial ratios in our credit agreement are total leverage total debt ebitda  as defined and senior secured leverage senior secured debt ebitda  as defined 
we have maintained compliance with all covenants throughout the entire term of our credit agreement and were in compliance at january  our total leverage ratio and senior secured leverage ratios were x and x  respectively  at january  these were within our maximum covenant requirements of x and x  respectively 
the total leverage ratio and senior secured leverage ratio requirements step down to x and x  respectively  at the end of based on the current market outlook and our internal forecasts  we anticipate we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants throughout fiscal year if business conditions deteriorate further  it could negatively impact our covenant compliance 
accordingly  we are evaluating alternatives  including but not limited to amendments to the financial ratio covenants in our credit agreement  to help ensure we remain in compliance during the current economic downturn 
the table below summarizes baldor s contractual obligations as of january  in thousands payments due by years total less than more than contractual obligations long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations other commercial commitments letters of credit a includes interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations 
interest associated with variable rate obligations is based upon interest rates in effect at january  the 
table of contents contractual amounts to be paid on variable rate obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates 
future changes in market interest rates could materially affect the contractual amounts to be paid 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we expect to make contributions of approximately million to the defined benefit pension plan and million to our postretirement health plan in off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements during any of the periods presented 
dividend policy dividends paid to shareholders amounted to per common share in  per common share in  and per common share in our objective is for shareholders to receive dividends while also participating in baldor s growth 
the terms of our credit agreement and indenture limit our ability to increase dividends in the future 
market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices  interest rates  concentrations of credit  and foreign exchange rates 
to help maintain stable pricing for customers  we enter into various commodity hedging transactions 
to manage interest rate risk on variable rate outstanding debt  we enter into various interest rate hedging transactions 
we are a purchaser of certain commodities  including copper and aluminum  and periodically utilize commodity futures and options for hedging purposes to reduce the effects of changing commodity prices 
generally  contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
we had derivative contracts designated as commodity cash flow hedges with a fair value liability of million recorded in other accrued expenses at january  a hypothetical change in the fair value of open positions would not have a material effect on our results of operations 
our interest rate risk is primarily related to our senior secured credit facility which bears interest at variable rates 
additionally  our long term obligations include senior unsecured notes totalling million which bear interest at a fixed rate of 
we utilize various interest rate hedge instruments to manage future exposure to interest rate risk on a portion of the variable rate obligations 
critical terms notional amount  interest reset dates  and underlying index of the hedge instruments coincide with those of the credit facility 
consequently  the hedges are expected to offset changes in the expected cash flows due to fluctuations in the interest rate over the term of the hedge instrument 
details regarding the instruments as of january   are as follows instrument notional amount maturity rate paid rate received fair value swap million april  libor million collar million april  libor libor  floor  cap million libor is determined each reset date based on london and new york business days 
floating rates used in instruments are matched exactly to floating rate in credit agreement 
fair value is an estimated amount that the company would have received paid at january   to terminate the agreement 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables 
cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables is limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas and industries 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of customers financial 
table of contents conditions and generally do not require collateral 
no single customer represents more than of net accounts receivable or sales for any period presented in this report 
while we have not experienced an increase in customer bad debts  current market conditions increase the possibility that we could experience losses in the future 
we are monitoring current balances closely and evaluating credit carefully 
foreign affiliates comprise approximately of our consolidated net sales and generally conduct business in their respective local currencies 
as a result  our exposure to foreign currency risk is not significant 
we continue to monitor the effects of foreign currency exchange rates and will utilize foreign currency hedges where appropriate 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following are the critical accounting policies  which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis  current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions  and historical experience 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than anticipated  or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
historical write offs have been similar to our historical allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined principally by the last in  first out lifo method  except for non us inventories  which are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the valuation of lifo inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time 
the net realizable value of inventory is reviewed on an on going basis  with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence  and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory values may be required 
self insurance liabilities baldor s self insurance programs primarily include general and product liability  workers compensation  and health 
we self insure from the first dollar of loss up to specified retention levels 
eligible losses in excess of self insurance retention levels and up to stated limits of liability are covered by policies purchased from third party insurers 
the aggregate self insurance liability is estimated using claims experience and risk exposure levels for the periods being valued and current conditions 
adjustments to the self insurance liabilities may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors 
historical claims experience has been similar to historical estimated liabilities 
business combinations we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development and backlog are expensed at the date of acquisition 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
accordingly  for significant items  we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists 
the valuations are based on information available near the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management 

table of contents there are multiple methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for intangible assets  we typically use relief from royalty  income and market approach methodologies 
these methodoligies start with a forecast of the expected future net cash flows 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows  the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows  and the assessment of the asset s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset  including consideration of any technical  legal  regulatory  or economic barriers to entry 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles at january   goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles amounted to billion and million  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter 
however  we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business  unexpected significant declines in operating results  divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount  then goodwill is not considered impaired 
however  if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination ie  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a combination of the income approach  which utilizes a discounted cash flow model  and the market approach  which utilizes a guideline public company methodology 
judgments and assumptions related to revenue  gross profit  operating expenses  interest  capital expenditures  cash flows  and market conditions are inherent in developing the discounted cash flow model 
in applying the guideline public company method  we utilize valuation multiples derived from stock prices and enterprise values of publicly traded companies comparable to baldor 
in and  the first step of the annual impairment tests resulted in no indication of impairment 
subsequent to our annual testing at october   our market capitalization decreased significantly as a result of market driven declines in our stock trading price 
while our stock has not traded at a price below book value for a sustained period of time through our year end  we performed an interim test of goodwill values at january  due to the decline in market capitalization and overall market conditions 
in updating the annual testing analysis from october   we reviewed expectations of cash flows and other critical assumptions utilized in the analysis 
based on results of the step one interim test  management concluded that goodwill was not impaired at january  
table of contents in conjunction with our interim testing  we performed a sensitivity analysis  at the reporting unit level  on the discounted cash flows utilized in the analysis 
this sensitivity analysis indicated that a higher discount rate or more conservative revenue growth assumptions still resulted in estimated fair value exceeding carrying value 
furthermore  a hypothetical decrease of in the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units would still result in the fair value of each reporting unit exceeding the carrying value 
future changes in judgments and or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from these estimates which could ultimately result in the recognition of impairment charges in the financial statements 
in conjunction with our annual and interim testing of goodwill  we evaluated the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of our reporting units by reconciling to our market capitalization at each date 
this reconciliation allowed us to consider market expectations in corroborating the reasonableness of the fair value of our reporting units 
our market capitalization has declined further since january  as a result of additional market driven declines in our stock trading price 
this decline is consistent with overall market conditions and is not a result of changes in our expectations of future cash flows 
we will continue to monitor our market capitalization and expectations of future cash flows and will perform additional interim impairment testing if deemed necessary 
for our other intangible assets  if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized by an amount equal to that excess 
a relief from royalty methodology is utilized to estimate the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets 
if the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the estimate fair value of that asset  an impairment loss is recognized by the amount of the excess 
our fiscal other intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge 
however  a decline in the estimated fair value of one of our indefinite lived intangible assets would result in the estimated fair value falling below the carrying value by approximately million 
share based compensation share based compensation expense is recognized using the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
r  share based payments 
the fair value of the options is estimated using a black scholes option pricing formula 
the variables used in the option pricing formula for each grant are determined at the time of grant as follows volatility is based on the daily composite closing price of baldor s stock over a look back period of time that approximates the expected option life  risk free interest rates are based on the yield of us treasury strips as published in the wall street journal or provided by a third party on the date of the grant for the expected option life  dividend yields are based on baldor s dividend yield published in the wall street journal or provided by a third party on the date of the grant  and expected option life represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on historical experience

fair value measurements on december  we adopted fas no 
 fair value measurements fas no 
 for our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  primarily our commodity and interest rate derivatives 
see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding fas no 
in measuring the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we obtain quoted market prices from a third party broker at each measurement date for a majority of the instruments 
these quoted market prices are for identical assets liabilities traded in an active market 
for the remaining portion of the instruments  we obtain valuations from a third party broker that are based on inputs readily observable 
in measuring the fair value of our interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  we obtain valuations from a third party broker at each measurement date 
these valuations are derived from inputs readily observable eg  interest rates  yield curves and volatilities and can be matched to the terms of our derivatives 
the use of different assumptions in deriving these fair values could have a material impact on the estimated fair values recorded in our financial statements
