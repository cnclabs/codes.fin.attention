liquidity and capital resources history and background from february when our ipo occurred through fiscal  inclusive  we have raised a net total of approximately million from the issuance of common and preferred stock  the sale of convertible debt and the exercise of options and warrants for our capital stock 
our optical product markets experienced a severe downturn beginning in fiscal and resulted in a significant decline in the demand for our optical products 
despite the downturn in the optical product markets  we believe that some improvement occurred in recent fiscal years  including fiscal  with respect to the demand for our products in several of our other markets  particularly the precision molded optics for laser tools and infrared optics for fire safety 
nevertheless  we did not reach a status of positive cash flow or profitability during fiscal or we have developed our operating plan for fiscal and forecasted revenues and cash flows 
we believe we currently have adequate financial resources for implementation and achievement of our fiscal operating plan and to sustain operations as currently conducted in the coming year 
the cost savings generated in fiscal and due to the reduced rent obligations on the facility in orlando and the salary reductions in orlando is expected to continue through fiscal we have taken certain actions to conserve our cash including extending payment terms with certain of our suppliers 
we have negotiated payment plans with some key vendors and are working with other vendors to develop payment plans 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we delayed payments to one of our secured note holders  however as of september all payments which were past due have been paid and we are in compliance with the terms of the note 
we have instituted a cost reduction program and have reduced headcount in our orlando and shanghai facilities and reduced costs for medical insurance for our orlando employees 
in march the orlando staff was reduced to a four day work week 
this cost reduction program is expected to save  per year in wages and benefits 
in addition  we have redesigned certain product lines collimators and precision molded optics  increased sales prices on gradium products  obtained more favorable material costs by sourcing some purchased components in china  and have instituted more efficient management techniques which have improved our product yields 
we believe these factors will contribute towards achieving profitability assuming we meet our sales targets 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern 
during the third quarter of fiscal we faced financial challenges along with many in the industries we do business with  as the worldwide economic instability continued to create turbulence in the market 
we engaged in continuing efforts to keep costs under control as we sought renewed sales growth 
our efforts were directed toward reaching positive cash flow and profitability 
if these efforts are not successful  we will need to raise additional capital 
should capital not be available to us at reasonable terms  other actions may become necessary in addition to cost control measures and continued efforts to increase sales 
these actions may include exploring strategic options for the sale of the company  the sale of certain product lines  the creation of joint ventures or strategic alliances under which we will pursue business opportunities  the creation of licensing arrangements with respect to our technology  or other alternatives 
on september   the company had a book cash balance of approximately  cash flows recent financings in fiscal we had a convertible debenture offering with twenty four institutional and private investors 
on august   we executed a securities purchase agreement with respect to the private placement of senior convertible debentures the debentures 
the debentures are secured by substantially all of our previously unencumbered assets pursuant to a security agreement and are guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries  geltech inc and lightpath optical instrumentation shanghai co  ltd pursuant to a subsidiary guarantee 
the sale of the debentures generated gross proceeds of approximately  and net proceeds of  we used the funds to provide working capital for our operations 
among the investors were steven brueck  j 
james gaynor  louis leeburg  robert ripp  gary silverman and james magos  all of whom were directors or officers of lightpath as of august  mr 
magos resigned effective september  the maturity date of the debentures is august   on which date the outstanding principal amount of the debentures will be due 
interest of  was due on october  and was prepaid by the company on august  by issuing  shares of common stock in payment of such interest based upon the closing price of per share 
the remaining interest on the debentures was prepaid by issuing common stock in december upon issuance the debentures were immediately convertible into  shares of common stock  based on a conversion price of per share  which was of the closing bid price of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market on july  investors also received warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock the warrants 
the warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on august  with of the warrants  exercisable for  shares  priced at per share and the remaining of the warrants  exercisable for  shares  of the warrants priced at per share 
if all of the warrants were exercised at that time  we would have received additional proceeds in the amount of  investors who participated in our july common stock private placement were offered an incentive to invest in the convertible debenture offering 
four investors from the july offering participated in the convertible debenture offering and as a result we reduced the exercise price of the warrants they received in the july offering from per share to per share 
the reduced exercise price lowered potential proceeds on the exercise of the warrants from the july offering by  to  additionally  such investors were issued an aggregate of  incentive common shares the incentive shares  valued at we paid a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the offering  first montauk securities corp 
first montauk  in an amount equal to  plus costs and expenses 
we also issued to first montauk and its designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  which was of the closing bid price of the our common stock on the nasdaq capital market on july  the warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on august  in addition  the exercise price of of the warrants previously issued to the first montauk and its designees at the closing of the july financing was reduced from to per share 
this reduced warrant exercise price lowered potential proceeds on the exercise of the warrants issued to first montauk from the july offering by  to  the private placement is exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended the act  pursuant to section of the act in that we sold the debentures and warrants in a transaction not involving any public offering and pursuant to rule of regulation d promulgated thereunder 
the shares into which the debentures are convertible  the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and the incentive shares have been registered for resale under the securities act of  as amended 
the registration was declared effective on october  the warrants and the incentive shares issued to the debenture holders were valued at  and recorded as a discount on the debt 
the incentive shares were valued using the fair market value of our stock on the date of issuance 
the warrants were valued using the black scholes valuation model using assumptions similar to those used to value our stock options and rsu s 
in addition a beneficial conversion feature associated with the debentures was valued at  and was recorded as a discount on the debt 
the total debt discount of  will be amortized using the effective interest method over the month term of the debentures 
on december  the debentures were amended to allow debenture holders to convert of their debentures into common stock 
as a result   of the debentures were converted into  common shares 
as an inducement to convert the debentures  we issued additional warrants valued at  using the black scholes method and prepaid the interest of  on the unconverted portion of the debentures through the maturity date of august   which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
interest payment of  for the quarter ended december  resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
as a result of the debenture conversion   of debt discount was written off to interest expense 
during the year ended june    of the debt discount was amortized through interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and the remaining unamortized debt discount was  at june  for the quarter ended june    of the amortized debt discount was amortized through interest expense 
on may  we filed a registration statement to register those additional interest shares and warrants which were issued in december the registration statement was declared effective on june  we also incurred debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the debentures of  which will be amortized over the month term using the effective interest method 
the costs were for broker commissions  legal and accounting fees  filing fees and  representing the fair value of the  warrants shares issued to first montauk 
we used the black scholes model to determine fair value of the warrants 
the warrants carry a five year term  expiring on august   and are immediately exercisable at a per share price of for one third of the warrants and for two thirds of the warrants 
as of june    of the debt issuance costs were amortized through interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and the remaining unamortized balance was total principal outstanding on the debenture and the amount outstanding for directors and officers purchases under the debentures was  and  respectively at june   less unamortized debt discount of  and  respectively 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  we had a private placement offering 
on august   we executed a securities purchase agreement with thirty three institutional and private investors with respect to a private placement of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at per share and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share the august warrants 
the august warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on february  we received aggregate gross cash proceeds from the issuance of the common stock exclusive of proceeds from any future exercise of the august warrants in the amount  we will use the funds to provide working capital for our operations 
we paid a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the offering  garden state securities  inc garden state  in an amount equal to  plus costs and expenses 
we also issued to garden state and its designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at exercise price equal to per share  for a five year term beginning february  the private placement is exempt from the registration requirements of the act  pursuant to section of the act in that the shares of common stock were sold by the company in a transaction not involving any public offering and pursuant to rule of regulation d promulgated thereunder 
the shares of common stock and the shares of common stock underlying the august warrants are restricted securities that have not been registered under the act and may not be offered or sold absent registration or applicable exemption from registration requirements 
the company and the investors also executed a registration rights agreement dated august   pursuant to which we have undertaken the obligation to file with the securities and exchange commission  and cause to be declared effective  a registration statement to register the shares of common stock issued in the private placement and the shares of common stock underlying the august warrants 
cash flows operating and investing cash used by operations during fiscal was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from fiscal we anticipate lower glass costs by replacing an internally fabricated material with purchased materials from suppliers in asia and lower coating costs due to larger unit volumes which are expected to improve our cash flow in future years 
while progress has been made to reduce operating cash outflow since fiscal  significant risk and uncertainty remains 
our cash provided by operations was approximately  for the fourth quarter of fiscal cost cutting measures were implemented in fiscal and but revenues were not high enough to cover fixed costs 
the fiscal operating plan and related financial projections which we have developed anticipate continued sales growth and continuing margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs  offset by marginal increases in selling  administrative and new product development expenditures 
during fiscal  we expended approximately  for capital equipment in comparison to  during fiscal the majority of the capital expenditures during fiscal were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity and for tenant improvements due to the re location of the shanghai facility 
the majority of the capital expenditures during fiscal were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity and for tenant improvements due to the reduction in space at our orlando facility 
our operating plan for fiscal estimates expenditures at similar levels to enhance or expand our capacity  however  we may spend more or less depending on opportunities and circumstances 
results of operations operating results for fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  our consolidated revenues totaled million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or compared to revenues for fiscal of million 
the decrease was attributable to decreases in sales of aspheric lenses  collimators and gradium product sales 
in our operating plan for fiscal we expect to see revenue gains in aspheric lenses and infrared lenses while collimators  gradium and isolator sales are expected to remain at current levels 
we expect significant mix change in our revenue number in fiscal as we increase the volume of low cost lenses sold and continue to transform the company into a high volume molded optical manufacturer 
we anticipate our growth will come from the laser tool market in fiscal fiscal consolidated cost of sales of million was approximately of net revenues of million  which is a decrease over fiscal when our cost of sales was approximately of net revenues 
this percentage decrease was caused by several factors 
among them  during the year we were successful in shifting a higher percentage of production of molded optics to our shanghai facility  reducing materials cost by incorporating lower cost glass into our products and manufacturing lens holders in house at a reduced cost  all of which we anticipate will result in continued improvements to our margins 
these cost reductions have lowered our cost structure and enabled us to bid on the high volume low cost business 
lower revenues were not sufficient to absorb our fixed costs and overhead costs 
our two plants were at a combined capacity for fiscal our plant capacity and overhead structure are sufficient to handle much higher levels of production 
going forward into fiscal  the emphasis will be continued unit cost reductions driven by efficient purchasing and more sourcing in china of raw materials and coating services and higher yields due to a more experienced workforce at the shanghai facility 
over the course of fiscal  as our manufacturing shifted to our shanghai facility  we reduced our headcount in orlando from to as of june   over of our precision molded optics production had been transferred to our shanghai facility 
this line comprises of our total revenue and with the majority of the manufacturing now at the shanghai facility our gross margin will continue to improve as we have not yet seen the full year impact of this transfer 
we are starting to transfer isolator and gradium production to our shanghai facility as well 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we reduced expenses through a reduction of salaries and benefits  reduction of board compensation  decreased stock compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock issued  decreased legal costs for litigation and the elimination in fiscal of severance and search fees related to the replacement of our chief executive officer that were incurred in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal there were two one time events resulting in reductions to general and administrative expenses  receipt of  from our d o insurance carrier as a refund of legal expenses and receipt of  from the chinese government related to the move of our manufacturing facility in shanghai 
our operating plan for fiscal projects business levels that will require selling  general and administrative expenses to remain level 
we plan to manage the orlando workforce size to meet profit and cash flow goals 
new product development costs in fiscal decreased by approximately  to approximately  this decrease was primarily due to decreased product development materials and labor costs 
our operating plan for fiscal projects that product development spending will be level to fiscal in fiscal our amortization of intangibles remained at approximately  and is expected to remain at this level for fiscal interest expense increased by approximately million to approximately million compared to approximately  in fiscal this is primarily due to interest on the convertible debentures payable in shares issued in august and related amortization of debt discount and debt costs and the fair value of warrants issued to induce conversion of the debentures in december recorded as interest expense 
investment and other income decreased by approximately  to  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal  due to a decrease in interest earned on lower cash balances and lower royalty fees earned 
net loss for fiscal was approximately million compared with approximately million in fiscal  a decline of approximately million 
this improvement in the current year was comprised principally of gross margin improvement of  or primarily due to reduced salaries and benefits of  and lower building costs  better production yields and lower material costs  reduced sg a salaries and benefits of  decreased legal fees of  decreased recruitment fees of  decreased stock compensation expense of  decreased building costs of  for sg a  decreased travel costs of  for sg a  decreased advertising costs of  decreased r d of  due to lower salaries and benefits and lower material purchases  and increased interest expense of million due to interest and amortization of debt discount and debt costs on debentures 
key performance indicators how we operate we have continuing sales of two basic types occasional sales via ad hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations our turns business and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business of customer product development 
in this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create certain optical designs for them  including complex multi component designs that we call engineered assemblies 
this is followed by sampling small numbers of the product for the customer s test and evaluation 
thereafter  should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need  we negotiate and win a contract sometimes called a design win whether of a blanket purchase order type or a supply agreement 
the strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business  which is unpredictable and uneven 
a key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible 
we have several challenges in doing so maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability  including a high quality and responsive optical design engineering staff  the fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume  commercial production for example  in the case of molded optics  this may be volumes over one million pieces per year they begin to work seriously to reduce costs which often leads them to turn to larger or overseas producers  even if sacrificing quality  and our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional capital expenditures in other words  because of our limited cash resources and cash flow  we may not be able to service every opportunity that presents itself in our markets without arranging for such additional capital expenditures 
despite these challenges to winning more annuity business  we nevertheless believe we can be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market  a market that we believe is underserved in this area of service offering 
additionally  we believe that we offer value to some customers as a source of supply in the united states should they be unwilling to commit their entire source of supply of a critical component to foreign merchant production sources 
we also continue to have the proprietary gradium lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets 
our key indicators usually on a weekly basis  management reviews a number of performance indicators 
some of these indicators are qualitative and others are quantitative 
these indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the business change 
they are mostly non financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line  production yield rates by major product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished shippable product 
these indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded unit production per shift  which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time 
higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications 
the data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes 
we believe that our non financial production indicators  such as those noted  are proprietary information 
financial indicators that are usually reviewed at the same time include the major elements of the micro level business cycle sales backlog  ebitda  inventory levels  and accounts receivable levels and quality 
these indicators are similarly used to determine tactical operating actions and changes and are discussed in more detail below 
sales backlog sales growth has been and continues to be our best indicator of success 
our best view into the efficacy of our sales efforts is in our order book 
our order book equates to sales backlog 
it has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect quantitatively  our backlog s prospective dollar value and qualitatively  what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer for date certain delivery 
we define our disclosure backlog as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues 
this includes customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria 
generally  higher backlog is better for us 
disclosure backlog  as defined above  has been as follows in the immediately preceding six fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended approximate disclosure backlog q q q q q q our disclosure backlog at june  was million 
due to market conditions  throughout fiscal new orders were lower from the previous year 
in fiscal we de booked some orders due to customer cancellation and new bookings were at a lower level than shipments 
ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure used by management  lenders and certain investors as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of some aspects of a corporation s financial position and core operating performance 
investors sometimes use ebitda as it allows for some level of comparability of profitability trends between those businesses differing as to capital structure and capital intensity by removing the impacts of depreciation and amortization 
ebitda also does not include changes in major working capital items such as receivables  inventory and payables  which can also indicate a significant need for  or source of  cash 
since decisions regarding capital investment and financing and changes in working capital components can have a significant impact on cash flow  ebitda is not a good indicator of a business s cash flows 
we use ebitda for evaluating the relative underlying performance of the company s core operations and for planning purposes 
we calculate ebitda by adjusting net loss to exclude net interest expense  income tax expense or benefit  depreciation and amortization  thus the term earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and the acronym ebitda 
our ebitda as defined above  has been as follows in the immediately preceding six fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended ebitda q q q q q q inventory levels we manage inventory levels to minimize investment in working capital but still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree 
we review our inventory for obsolete items quarterly 
while the mix of inventory is an important factor  including adequate safety stocks of long lead time materials  an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarter s ending inventory expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s cost of sales  also known as days cost of sales in inventory  or dcsi 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending inventory by the quarter s cost of goods sold  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dcsi measure equates to a lesser investment in inventory and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dcsi for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dcsi days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average in comparison  our days cost of sales in inventory at june  was  comparing to at june  we believe this upward trend in inventory was principally caused by the standard cost re evaluation in may reflecting lower costs due to manufacturing in china and an increase to the inventory reserve 
we expect inventory levels to decline through fiscal as we continue to reduce costs 
accounts receivable levels and quality similarly  we manage accounts receivable levels to minimize investment in working capital 
weekly we review all receivables that are sixty days past terms 
these accounts are contacted and all future shipments to them are placed on hold 
we measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our normally extended terms  which are generally days 
the most important aggregate measure of accounts receivable is the quarter s ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s net revenues  also known as days sales outstanding  or dso 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending net accounts receivable by the quarter s net revenues  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dso measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dso for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dso days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average our days sales outstanding at june  was  compared to at june  we plan to monitor our collections efforts to keep this key indicator as low as reasonably possible and strive to have it no higher than we have noticed an increase in dso as of our quarterly revenue was shipped in the last month of the quarter 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods presented 
our significant estimates include the allowance for trade receivables which is made up of reserves for bad debts  inventory reserves for obsolesense  revenue recognition  valuation of compensation expense on stock based awards and beneficial conversion and warrant valuation related to convertible debentures 
although we believe that these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates given a change in conditions or assumptions that have been consistently applied 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our board of directors  and the board of directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
our critical and significant accounting policies are described in note of our financial statements in item the critical accounting policies used by management and the methodology for its estimates and assumptions are as follows allowance for accounts receivable is calculated by taking of the total of invoices that are over days past due from due date and of the total of invoices that are over days past due from due date 
accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms 
the company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition 
recovery of bad debt amounts previously written off is recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense in the period the payment is collected 
if the company s actual collection experience changes  revisions to its allowance may be required 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
inventory obsolesence reserve is calculated by reserving for items that have not been sold in two years or that have not been purchased in two years and for products which we have more than a two year supply  as well as reserving for other items deemed to be slow moving within the last months and reserving for items deemed to have low material usage within the last six months 
revenue is recognized from product sales when products are shipped to the customer  provided that the company has received a valid purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of the associated receivable is reasonably assured  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
revenues from product development agreements are recognized as milestones are completed in accordance with the terms of the agreements and upon shipment of products  reports or designs to the customer 
stock based compensation is expensed in accordance with sfas r  share based payment  which requires the recognition of the cost of employee or director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements and is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award 
sfas r also requires the stock option compensation expense to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award typically  the vesting period 
the company estimates the fair value of each option award issued under its stock option plans on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in footnote to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas r 
the company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of its common stock 
these historical periods may exclude portions of time when unusual transactions occurred 
the company determines the expected life based on historical experience with similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms  vesting schedules and post vesting forfeitures 
for shares that vest contingent upon achievement of certain performance criteria  an estimate of the probability of achievement is applied in the estimate of fair value 
if the goals are not met  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
the company bases the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on us treasury issues with an equivalent remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award 
the company has never paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company separates the grants into homogeneous groups and analyzes the assumptions for each group 
the company then computes the expense for each group utilizing these assumptions 
beneficial conversion and warrant valuation 
the company records a beneficial conversion feature bcf related to the issuance of convertible debt instruments that have conversion features at fixed rates that are in the money when issued  and the fair value of warrants issued in connection with those instruments 
the bcf for the convertible instruments is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds to warrants  based on their relative fair value using the black scholes pricing model  and as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion feature 
the discounts recorded in connection with the bcf and warrant valuation are recognized as non cash interest expense over the term of the convertible debt  using the effective interest method
