during the periods presented below  we classified properties as held for sale and  in compliance with sfas no 
 have reported revenue and expenses from these properties as discontinued operations for each period presented in our annual report on form k 
this reclassification had no effect on our reported net income or funds from operations

the results of operations resulting from these investments are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from the dates invested

table of contents form k for further information regarding our debt  common stock and discontinued operations  respectively 
also includes depreciation and amortization reflected in discontinued operations related to properties sold or held for sale 
funds from operations  or ffo  is a widely recognized measure of reit performance 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition  or that interpret the nareit definition differently than we do 
the revised white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit in april defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits 
we also use ffo as one of several criteria to determine performance based bonuses for members of our senior management 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in rental rates  operating costs  interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in maryland on august  primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased healthcare facilities across the united states 
we also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants 
we have operated as a reit since april   and accordingly  elected reit status upon the filing in september of our calendar year federal income tax return 
our existing tenants are  and our prospective tenants will generally be  healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations 
we offer financing for these operators real estate through lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long term basis ranging from to years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers 
we also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases 
our existing portfolio minimum escalators range from to  although some of our properties do not have an escalator 
most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases 
in addition to the base rent  our leases require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility 
some leases also require our tenants to pay percentage rents  which are based on the level of those tenants revenues from their operations 
the following discussion related to our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in item of this annual report on form k 
we selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our taxable reit subsidiary  which they use for acquisitions and working capital 
we consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons it provides opportunities to make income earning investments that yield attractive risk adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise  and by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators  we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of  and financing sources for  healthcare facilities 
for purpose of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we conduct business operations in one segment 
at december   our portfolio consisted of properties healthcare facilities which we own are leased to tenants with the remainder in the form of mortgage loans collateralized by interests in health care real estate 
we have one acquisition loan outstanding  the proceeds of which our tenant used for the acquisition of six hospital operating companies 
the facilities we owned and the facilities that collateralized our mortgage loans were in twenty one states  had a carrying cost of approximately billion including the balances of our mortgage loans and comprised approximately of our total assets 
our acquisition and other loans of approximately million represented approximately of our total assets 
we do not expect the aggregate of such non mortgage loans and certain other non real estate investments at any time to exceed of our total assets 
we also had cash and temporary investments of approximately million that represented approximately of our total assets 
during the second and third quarters of  we completed the acquisition from a single seller of properties leased to unrelated operators 
these facilities represent an investment of approximately million 
four of the seven operators healthsouth corporation  community health systems  inc  iasis healthcare llc and health management associates  inc are publicly reporting companies and of the aggregate rent of the acquired portfolio is guaranteed by such publicly reporting companies 
in may  we acquired a long term acute care hospital in detroit  michigan at a cost of million from an unrelated party and entered into an operating lease with vibra healthcare vibra 
also in may  we completed the sale of three rehabilitation facilities to vibra healthcare and realized proceeds from sale and related lease termination fees and loan partial pre payment totaling million  including million in early lease termination fees and million of a loan partial prepayment 
we realized a total gain on the sale of these facilities of approximately million and wrote off approximately million in related straight line rent receivable upon completion of the sales 
income from these properties is reflected as 
table of contents income from discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and in june  we entered into a million financing arrangement with affiliates of prime related to three southern california hospital campuses operated by prime 
in july  we acquired one of the facilities from a prime affiliate for approximately million and in november acquired the remaining two facilities for an aggregate cost of approximately million and entered into year leases with prime affiliate 
we financed our acquisitions using proceeds from our march issuance of debt and equity see note debt and note common stock in item of this k  from our existing revolving credit facilities and from the sale of three rehabilitation facilities to vibra in may see note discontinued operations in item of this k 
in august  we acquired two general acute care hospitals in houston  texas river oaks and redding shasta  california at a cost of million and entered into operating leases with the operators  affiliates of hospital partners of america  inc hpa  a multi hospital operating company 
in june  we received notification from the houston operator that due in part to irregularities recently discovered by independent members of the hpa board of directors  the houston hospital would close and enter bankruptcy proceedings 
the operator has not paid rent since june in august  the redding operator notified us that it would not pay rent commencing in september 
on september   hpa and most of its affiliates other than the redding operator and management company entered into bankruptcy proceedings 
in september  our houston facilities were damaged by hurricane ike 
we recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter of related to our insurance deductible 
our houston facilities are comprised of two separate campuses that will likely be resolved independent of each other 
in addition to the value of the facilities that would result from sale or re leasing  we also have an interest in certain accounts receivable of the redding facility 
accordingly  we believe that proceeds from the sale  lease and security for the facilities will be sufficient to recover our investments in the houston real estate 
upon the original purchase transaction in august  a portion of the houston purchase price was allocated to intangible lease costs and was being amortized over the term of the lease 
we recorded million of accelerated amortization related to this lease intangible and a million charge for the write off of straight line rent associated with the houston facilities in the third quarter of in november  we entered into a new lease agreement for the redding hospital 
the new operator  an affiliate of prime  agreed to increase the lease base from million in the previous lease to million and to pay up to million in additional rent and profit participation subject to the future profitability of the new lessee s operations 
upon the original purchase transaction in august  a portion of the redding purchase price was allocated to intangible lease costs and was being amortized over the term of the lease 
we recorded million of accelerated amortization related to this lease intangible and a million charge for the write off of straight line rent associated with the redding hospital in the third quarter of we expensed approximately million of costs associated with the bankruptcy of hospital partners of america inc  the parent of the former tenants at both river oaks and shasta 
we believe some these costs may be substantially recovered through collection of pre bankruptcy accounts receivable on which we have a first lien plus other assets 
however  we do not expect to recognize any recovery until the issues surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings are clarified 
in late january  the current operator of our bucks county facility gave notice of their intentions to close the facility 
the lease was terminated on january  and operations at the bucks county facility have ceased 
we are in the process of negotiating with potential new operators or buyers 
we have stopped accrual of revenue from the bucks county hospital and have recorded charges for the write off of straight line rent million and other receivables million as of december  in january  we issued million shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
we used these proceeds to pay down our existing revolver 
at march  we had approximately million of debt of which approximately million had interest rates that were fixed and carried a weighted average rate of approximately and approximately million had variable rates with a weighted average of approximately 

table of contents at march   we had approximately million of cash and immediate availability under our revolving credit agreements 
critical accounting policies in order to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances 
we believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of lease revenues  credit losses  fair values and periodic depreciation of our real estate assets  stock compensation expense  and the effects of any derivative and hedging activities have significant effects on our financial statements 
each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments 
we rely on our experience  collect historical and current market data  and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions or assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
in addition  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
our accounting estimates include the following revenue recognition 
our revenues  which are comprised largely of rental income  include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its respective lease reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of the lease 
since some of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset  and include in revenues  straight line rent that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the term of the lease 
accordingly  our management determines  in our judgment  to what extent the straight line rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review each tenant s straight line rent receivable on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates  and economic conditions in the area in which the facility is located 
if it becomes probable that we will not collect some or all of the straight line rent that we have accrued  we record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write off of the specific rent receivable 
we make loans to our tenants and from time to time may make construction or mortgage loans to facility owners or other parties 
we recognize interest income on loans as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding 
these loans are generally collateralized by interests in real estate  receivables  the equity interests of a tenant  or corporate and individual guarantees and are usually cross defaulted with their leases and or other loans 
we periodically evaluate loans to determine what amounts  if any  may not be collectible 
accordingly  a provision for losses on loans receivable is recorded when it becomes probable that the loan will not be collected in full 
the provision is an amount which reduces the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the loan s collateral  if any 
at that time  we discontinue recording interest income 
investments in real estate 
we record investments in real estate at cost  and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset 
while our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility  to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance  we expense those costs as incurred 
we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of generally years for buildings and improvements  three to seven years for equipment and fixtures  and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant owned improvements and leasehold interests 
when circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments  we review the recoverability of the facility s carrying value 
the review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  from the facility s use and eventual disposition 
our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income  market and other applicable trends  and residual value  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to inability to recover the carrying value of a facility  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility 
we do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at december  and 
table of contents purchase price allocation 
we record above market and below market in place lease values  if any  for the facilities we own which are based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
we amortize any resulting capitalized above market lease values as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
we amortize any resulting capitalized below market lease values as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
because our strategy to a large degree involves the origination and acquisition of long term lease arrangements at market rates relative to our acquisition costs  we do not expect the above market and below market in place lease values to be significant for many of our anticipated transactions 
we measure the aggregate value of other intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between i the property valued with existing leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant when acquired 
management s estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg  discounted cash flow analysis 
factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing  and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which we expect to range primarily from three to months  depending on specific local market conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal costs  and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
the total amount of other intangible assets acquired  if any  is further allocated to in place lease values and customer relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant s lease and our overall relationship with that tenant 
characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  and expectations of lease renewals  including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement  among other factors 
we amortize the value of in place leases to expense over the initial term of the respective leases  which range primarily from one to years at december  the value of customer relationship intangibles  if any  is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases  but in no event will the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
if a lease is terminated  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense 
at december   we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles 
loans loans consist of mortgage loans  working capital loans and other long term loans 
interest income from loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding 
mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property 
working capital and other long term loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees 
we record loans at cost 
we evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal for each of our loans to determine whether they are impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of the allowance is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to either the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows or the loans effective interest rate or to the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
losses from rent receivables a provision for losses on rent receivables is recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full 
the provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from the collateral  if any 

table of contents accounting for derivative financial investments and hedging activities 
we account for our derivative and hedging activities  if any  using sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which requires all derivative instruments to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
in  we entered into derivative contracts as part of our offering of exchangeable senior notes the exchangeable notes 
the contracts are generally termed capped call or call spread contracts 
these contracts are financial instruments that are separate from the exchangeable notes themselves  but affect the overall potential number of shares which will be issued by us to satisfy the conversion feature in the exchangeable notes 
the exchangeable notes can be exchanged into shares of our common stock when our stock price exceeds per share  which is the equivalent of shares per  note 
the number of shares actually issued upon conversion is equivalent to the amount by which our stock price exceeds times the conversion rate 
the capped call transaction allows us to effectively increase that exchange price from to 
therefore  our shareholders will not experience dilution of their shares from any settlement or conversion of the exchangeable notes until the price of our stock exceeds per share rather than per share 
when evaluating this transaction  we followed the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
eitf no 
requires that contracts such as this capped call which meet certain conditions must be accounted for as permanent adjustments to equity rather than periodically adjusted to their fair value as assets or liabilities 
we have evaluated the terms of these contracts and recorded this capped call as a permanent adjustment to stockholders equity in in march  our operating partnership issued and sold  in a private offering  million of exchangeable senior notes the exchangeable notes and received proceeds of million 
in april  the operating partnership sold an additional million of exchangeable notes under the initial purchasers overallotment option and received proceeds of million 
the exchangeable notes will pay interest semi annually at a rate of per annum and mature on april  the exchangeable notes have an initial exchange rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of the notes  representing an exchange price of approximately per common share 
the exchangeable notes are senior unsecured obligations of the operating partnership  guaranteed by us 
the and exchangeable notes contain conversion features as described above 
sfas no 
states that embedded derivative contracts  such as the conversion features in the notes  should not be treated as a financial instrument separate from the notes if they meet certain conditions in eitf no 
we have evaluated the conversion feature in the and exchangeable notes and have determined that they should not be reported separately from the debt 
however  in may  the fasb issued staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  the fsp 
the fsp requires that the initial debt proceeds from the sale of our and exchangeable notes be allocated between a liability component and an equity component 
the resulting debt discount equaled to the value assigned to the equity component would be amortized over the period the debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
the fsp is effective for our fiscal year beginning on january  and requires retroactive application to the and exchangeable notes  which we currently estimate will result in us recognizing an additional non cash interest expense of approximately million in variable interest entities 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  which is termed fin r 
fin r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  guidance on how to determine which business enterprise should consolidate such an entity  and guidance on when it should do so 
this model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
an entity meeting either of these two criteria is a variable interest entity  or vie 
a vie must be consolidated by any entity which is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
if an entity is not the primary beneficiary of the vie  the vie is not consolidated 
we periodically evaluate the terms of our relationships with our tenants and borrowers to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary and if we should consolidate such tenant or borrower 
at december    and 
table of contents  we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of any such vie nor were there any reconsideration events  as defined  during   or stock based compensation 
prior to  we used the intrinsic value method to account for the issuance of stock options under our equity incentive plan in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r became effective for our annual and interim periods beginning january   but had no material effect on the results of our operations 
during the years ended december    and we recorded approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of expense for share based compensation related to grants of restricted common stock  deferred stock units and other stock based awards 
in  we also granted performance based restricted share awards 
because these awards will vest based on our performance  we must evaluate and estimate the probability of achieving those performance targets 
any changes in these estimates and probabilities must be recorded in the period when they are changed 
in  the compensation committee made awards which are earned only if we achieve certain stock price levels  total shareholder return or other market conditions 
the awards were made pursuant to our multi year incentive plan mip adopted by the compensation committee and consisted of three components service based awards  core performance awards cpre  and superior performance awards spre 
the service based awards vest annually and ratably over a seven year period 
we recognize expense over the vesting period on the straight line method for service based awards 
the cpre and spre awards vest based on what sfas no 
r terms market conditions 
market conditions are vesting conditions which are based on our stock price levels or our total shareholder return stock price and dividends compared to an index of other reit stocks 
the spre awards require additional service after being earned  if they are in fact earned 
for the cpre awards  the period over which the awards are earned is not fixed because the awards provide for cumulative measures over multiple years 
sfas no 
r requires that we estimate the period over which the awards will likely be earned  regardless of the period over which the award allows as the maximum period over which it can be earned 
also  because some awards have multiple periods over which they can be earned  we must segregate individual awards into tranches  based on their vesting or estimated earning periods 
these complexities required us to use an independent consultant to assist us in modeling both the value of the award and the various periods over which each tranche of an award will be earned 
we used what is termed a monte carlo simulation model which determines a value and earnings periods based on multiple outcomes and their probabilities 
beginning in  we began recording expense over the expected or derived vesting periods using the calculated value of the awards 
we recorded expense over these vesting periods even though the awards have not yet been earned and  in fact  may never be earned 
in some cases  if the award is not earned  we will be required to reverse expenses recognized in earlier periods 
as a result  future stock based compensation expense may fluctuate based on the potential reversal of previously recorded expense 
disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes known material contractual obligations as of december  less than after contractual obligations year years years years total senior notes exchangeable notes revolving credit facilities term notes operating lease commitments purchase obligations totals assumes the balance and interest rates are those in effect at december  and no principal payments are made until the expiration of the facilities 
assumes interest rates are those in effect at december  some of our contractual obligations to make operating lease payments are related to ground leases for which we are reimbursed by our tenants 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generated cash of approximately million from operating activities during in addition to these resources  which we used primarily for distributions to our stockholders and partial payments of acquisition prices and debt service  we received proceeds from the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock million and exchangeable notes million 
we also received total cash proceeds of approximately million from a term loan facility and million from the sale of three facilities to vibra 
these resources were used primarily for the acquisition of new healthcare facilities during we expect a lower volume of acquisitions and other investments in than in any other recent year  and accordingly do not anticipate a current requirement for incremental financing 
however  because we believe it possible that global economic conditions and capital markets will remain volatile through and beyond  we intend to continually evaluate our need for incremental liquidity and depending on availability  cost and other terms  we may elect to further improve our liquidity through additional debt and equity transactions 
at december   we had availability under our existing revolving credit facilities of million and cash and equivalents of approximately million 
to improve our liquidity position  on january  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock 
including the underwriters purchase of an additional million shares to cover over allotments  net proceeds from this offering  after underwriting discount and commissions and offering expenses  were approximately million  which were substantially used to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities 
accordingly  at march   we had approximately million in cash and million available under our revolving credit facilities 
our revolving credit agreement and term loans impose certain restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to incur debts  grant liens  provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other entity  make redemptions and repurchases of our capital stock  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  engage in mergers or consolidations  enter into affiliated transactions  and change our business 
in addition  these agreements limit the amount of dividends we can pay to of funds from operations  as defined in the agreements  on a rolling four quarter basis 
these agreements also contain provisions for the mandatory prepayment of outstanding borrowings under these facilities from the proceeds received from the sale of properties that serve as collateral 
in addition to these restrictions  our revolving credit agreement and term loans contain customary financial and operating covenants  including covenants relating to total leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio  mortgage secured leverage ratio  recourse mortgage secured leverage ratio  consolidated adjusted net worth  floating rate debt  facility leverage ratio  and borrowing base interest coverage ratio 
these agreements also contain customary events of default  including among others  nonpayment of principal or interest  material inaccuracy of representations and failure to comply with our covenants 
subject to our compliance with these requirements  we may elect to extend the maturity of our million revolving credit facility from its november scheduled maturity to november we were in compliance with all such requirements at december  and as of the date of this annual report on form k 
in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of of our reit taxable income  computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains 
in december and february  our board of directors declared quarterly dividend distributions of per share to our common stockholders of record on december  and march   respectively 
the dividend declared in december was paid on january  see section titled distribution policy within this item of this annual report on form k for further information on our dividend policy along with the historical dividends paid on a per share basis 
short term liquidity requirements we have only nominal principal payments due and no maturities until november we believe that the liquidity available to us as described above  along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest  is sufficient to provide the resources necessary for operations  debt and interest obligations  and distributions in compliance with reit requirements during long term liquidity requirements our first significant maturity of debt comes due in november when our million term loan and our million revolving credit facility mature 
however  of this approximately million of debt coming due in  million million outstanding on march  relates to 
table of contents our revolving credit facility  which can be extended to so long as no default has occurred and we provide necessary notice of our intentions to extend the facility 
there is no assurance that conditions now existing in the credit markets will improve by november  when million of our debt comes due 
accordingly  while we plan to continually consider options to replace or refinance our existing debt arrangements if market conditions become more favorable  we will also evaluate other sources of liquidity including property sales we believe we have several assets that  even in the current credit environment  may attract purchasers willing and able to pay acceptable prices 
however  we believe any possible sale transactions will be conditional on the purchaser s ability to obtain acceptable financing  and there is no assurance that such financing will be available 
incremental borrowings we have recently successfully demonstrated our ability to access property level debt with attractive terms  providing liquidity for reduction of earlier maturing loans and debt 
moreover  our million term loan that matures in is prepayable without penalty and is collateralized by properties with an estimated aggregate value of more than million 
payment of this loan would make such collateral available for significant incremental borrowing 
because availability of credit is presently highly uncertain there is no assurance that we could obtain such incremental borrowings 
extension of existing maturities we expect that as market conditions improve  our existing lenders may be willing to offer additional extension options as our facilities mature 
there is no assurance  however  that conditions will improve or that our lenders will offer extensions  moreover  pricing and other terms that may be associated with any such extensions may not be attractive to us 
in addition  we believe other alternatives which at present we are not considering may be available to us to meet our liquidity requirements in the event more traditional forms of capital are unavailable 
these include the additional use of cash provided by operations  and the sale of equity and other securities 
as an example  in january  we sold million shares of common stock generating in net proceeds 
results of operations we began operations during the second quarter of since then  we have substantially increased our income earning investments each year  and we expect to continue to add to our investment portfolio  subject to the capital markets and other conditions described in this annual report on form k 
accordingly  we expect that future results of operations will vary from our historical results 
the results of operations discussed for the year ended december  and  have been adjusted to reflect the operations of five facilities which are recorded as discontinued operations in those years based on asset dispositions in and year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  was  compared to net income of  for the year ended december  a comparison of revenues for the years ended december  and is as follows change dollar amounts in thousands base rents straight line rents percentage rents interest from loans fee income total revenue revenue for the year ended december   was comprised of rents and interest and fee income from loans 
our base rents increased million in due to the acquisition of rent producing facilities in our fee income decreased in due to approximately million in mortgage loan pre 
table of contents payment fees in straight line rents decreased as compared to due to the write off of million in straight line rent receivables associated with the lease termination of river oaks  bucks county and our hospital in redding  california 
prime accounted for approximately for and of our gross revenues in and  respectively 
at december   assets leased and loaned to prime comprised of total assets and of our total investment 
vibra accounted for and of our gross revenues in and  respectively 
this includes percentage rents of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
at december   assets leased and loaned to vibra comprised of our total assets and of our total investment 
depreciation and amortization during the year ended december  was  compared to  during the year ended december  all of this increase is related to an increase in the number of rent producing properties from cost million at december  to cost million at december  and the accelerated amortization of intangibles related to the termination of our leases with the river oaks and redding hospitals in september resulting in charges of million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses during the years ended december  and  totaled  and  respectively  which represents an increase of 
the increase is partially due to an increase of approximately million of non cash share based compensation expense from stock based awards made during and we have also experienced an increase of approximately million in salary and wage expense due to an increase in the number of employees in and higher travel and office expenses of approximately  as a result of the expansion of our portfolio 
additionally  we recorded a million charge for the write off of uncollectible base rent and other receivables related to the bucks county hospital and a million insurance deductible repair expense related to the impact of hurricane ike on our river oaks medical center in houston  texas

table of contents of the sales 
the three vibra properties were classified as held for sale and were reflected in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets at million at december  as previously disclosed  in  we terminated leases for houston town and country hospital and medical office building mob complex and repossessed the real estate 
in january  we sold the hospital and mob complex and recorded a gain on the sale of real estate of approximately million 
during the period between termination of the lease and sale of the real estate  we substantially funded through loans the working capital requirements of the hospital s operator pending the operator s collection of patient receivables from medicare and other sources 
in  we wrote off approximately million of uncollectible receivables from the operator

we incurred approximately million net of insurance recovery and million in legal expense in and  respectively  related to the houston town and country litigation 
we continue to believe that the allegations have no merit and that we will prevail at trial 
moreover  we believe that some of these expenses will be recovered through insurance  but due to the uncertainty of future defense costs and the ultimate outcome of the trial  we cannot be assured that our total future cost will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures investors and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations  or ffo  as a supplemental performance measure 
while we believe net income available to common stockholders  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is the most appropriate measure  our management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental measure given its wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts 
ffo  reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions  principally adjusts for the effects of gaap depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  which assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses on sales of real estate  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition 
ffo should not be viewed as a substitute measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  which are significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations 
the following table presents a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands except per share amounts for the years ended december  net income depreciation and amortization gain on sale of real estate sold funds from operations ffo 
table of contents per diluted share amounts for the years ended december  net income depreciation and amortization gain on sale of real estate sold funds from operations ffo distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit commencing with our taxable year that began on april  and ended on december  to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute at least of our reit taxable income  excluding net capital gain  to our stockholders 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain such status going forward 
the table below is a summary of our distributions declared for the three year period ended december  declaration date record date date of distribution distribution per share december  december  january  august  september  october  may  june  july  february  march  april  november  december  january  august  september  october  may  june  july  february  march  april  november  december  january  august  september  october  may  june  july  february  march  april  we intend to pay to our stockholders  within the time periods prescribed by the code  all or substantially all of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it is our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our status as a reit under the code and to avoid corporate income and excise taxes on undistributed income 
in addition  our credit agreement  signed in november  limits the amounts of dividends we can pay to of funds from operations  as defined in the credit agreement  on a rolling four quarter basis 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in addition  the value of our facilities will be subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the ability of our tenants to generate profits  all of which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary 
the changes in the value of our facilities would be reflected also by changes in cap rates  which is measured by the current base rent divided by the current market value of a facility 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of our significant financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates and equity prices as if these changes had occurred 
the hypothetical changes chosen for these analyses reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impact from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of changes in market conditions 
interest rate sensitivity analysis for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common stockholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common stockholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   our outstanding debt totaled million  which consisted of fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
if market interest rates increase by one percentage point  the fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease by approximately million 
changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt will not have any impact on us unless we decided to repurchase the portion of our fixed rate debt related to our exchangeable notes in the open markets 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million per year 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million per year 
this assumes that the average amount outstanding under our variable rate debt for a year approximates million  the balance at december  share price sensitivity our exchangeable notes were initially exchangeable into shares of our stock for each  note 
this equates to a conversion price of per share 
this conversion price adjusts based on a formula which considers increases to our dividend subsequent to the issuance of the notes in november our dividends declared since we sold the exchangeable notes have adjusted our conversion price to per share which equates to shares per  note 
future changes to the conversion price will depend on our level of dividends which cannot be predicted at this time 
any adjustments for dividend increases until the notes are settled in will affect the price of the notes and the number of shares for which they will eventually be settled 
at the time we issued the exchangeable notes  we also entered into a capped call or call spread transaction 
the effect of this transaction was to increase the conversion price from to 
as a result  our shareholders will not experience any dilution until our share price exceeds 
if our share price exceeds that price  the result would be that we would issue additional shares of common stock 
assuming a price of per share  we would be required to issue an additional  shares 
at per share  we would be required to issue an additional two million shares 
our exchangeable notes have a similar conversion adjustment feature which could affect its stated exchange ratio of common shares per  principal amount of notes  equating to an exchange price of approximately per common share 
our dividends declared since we sold the exchangeable notes have not adjusted our conversion price as of december  future changes to the conversion price will depend on our level of dividends which cannot be predicted at this time 
any adjustments for dividend increases until the exchangeable notes are settled in will affect the price of the notes and the number of shares for which they will eventually be settled 
assuming a price of per share  we would be required to issue an additional  shares 
at per share  we would be required to issue an additional  shares
