overview sales for the year ended september  were million compared with million for fiscal the company reported a net loss for fiscal of  or per diluted share  compared with net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal net earnings decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a decrease in sales volume  reflecting the decrease in orders for fiscal  as well as a decline in gross margins from in fiscal to in fiscal these decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses of million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal other expenses were  in fiscal year compared to other income of  in fiscal year  primarily as a result of lower interest income on lower cash balances  higher interest expense related to the mortgage on the company s headquarters facility  unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and a valuation impairment charge related to a minority investment in proditec 
automated inspection systems sales were down  process systems sales were down  and parts and service sales decreased from the prior fiscal year 
the primary market forces driving demand for our products are the increased concerns about food safety and security  the inability of food and pharmaceutical processors to obtain cost effective labor  and the company s expansion into international markets 
export and international sales for the fiscal years ended september   and accounted for  and of net sales in each year  respectively 
the worldwide economic recession and tightening of credit markets affected the company s fiscal results 
order and sales volumes for fiscal were down across most of the company s significant geographic markets  industries and product lines 
the decline in consumer spending and economic uncertainty during the fiscal year resulted in conservative capital spending throughout our markets as customers evaluated the potential economic effects on their business 
this resulted in customers seeking to retain cash  price sensitivity  longer or delayed purchasing cycle processes  and more purchasing decisions being made at corporate levels as compared to local operating locations 
customers who had relied on credit facilities to finance capital purchases were often constrained by the lack of readily available credit 
in addition  in response to the resulting excess capacity  the market saw very aggressive pricing efforts to stimulate demand  which increased the competitive pricing pressure on the company 
in  the company continued to focus efforts on four major long term revenue initiatives grow the company s core food processing markets including potatoes  fresh cut  and processed fruit and vegetables  expand and grow its participation in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical market  strengthen and grow the level of international business  including asia pacific  eastern europe  latin america  and south american regions  and grow the company s aftermarket product lines 
in  decreased sales in our core food processing businesses  including upgrades  accounted for a significant portion of the company s decrease in revenues 
given the severe economic challenges in fiscal  sales in potatoes  fresh cut  processed fruit and vegetables  and pharmaceuticals all decreased in compared to fiscal the pharmaceutical initiative to develop and grow key s business in applications for the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical market began in the fourth quarter of fiscal anticipated penetration into this market will extend and advance the company s existing patented  high resolution inspection technology and material handling 
table of contents platforms 
in fiscal  the company completed development of its new verisym sorter which is designed for high volume softgel and tablet applications 
net sales for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products represent less than of the company s sales 
the company s sales and orders in north america  europe and latin america all decreased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
in fiscal  sales volume in china increased over from fiscal the company has historically been successful in selling tobacco sorters into china 
the company also experienced certain success in fiscal with new opportunities in the food processing business in china  and it continues to develop its marketing and product strategies to be more successful in the chinese food processing market 
in fiscal  the company entered into an original equipment manufacturer agreement with hauni maschinenbau ag which makes key technology hauni s sole supplier of optical sorting equipment for the tobacco industry 
the company also focused on its aftermarket product lines which include parts service and upgrades during fiscal with the introduction of the g family of products in  this enhanced vision engine technology provided additional product upgrade opportunities 
upgrades are an important aspect of the aftermarket product lines  and the modular g product family  which provides advanced image processing capability  has been well received by the company s current customers 
aftermarket sales including upgrades which are classified in automated inspection systems increased slightly in fiscal to million from million in fiscal in fiscal  the company released sixteen new products to the market place 
during the fourth quarter  the company received million in orders under a million agreement with a major vegetable processor  a significant portion of which was for our new manta sorter 
this  and other new orders  supports our belief that our new products create differentiated value for our customers and should provide future benefits from our investments 
the company s strategic initiatives for are to continue to leverage its new product developments released in fiscal the focus for the coming year is to grow sales in the company s core markets and geographical regions  and invest in a market driven technology road map that provides the new products required by our customers 
in addition  the company will focus on four primary industries potatoes  fresh cut produce  processed fruit and vegetables  and pharmaceutical nutraceutical  and focus on specific developing regions asia pacific  latin america  south america  eastern europe and the middle east 
the company also plans to continue to make strategic investments in research and development 
efforts in research and development will continue to focus on customer solutions  providing new products that meet current needs as well as anticipated future functionality requirements 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company went live with its new global enterprise resource planning erp system 
while the majority of the implementation was done during fiscal  the implementation will continue through a significant portion of the erp implementation costs have been capitalized 
during fiscal  the company incurred capital expenditures of approximately million associated with the implementation of the erp system 
cumulative capital expenditures on the erp system are approximately million 
application of critical accounting policies the company has identified its critical accounting policies  the application of which may materially affect the financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require management judgment to make estimates and assumptions in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories long lived assets allowances for warranties accounting for income taxes 
table of contents management has discussed the development  selection and related disclosures of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
additionally  the company sells its goods on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point  port of loading or port of discharge  depending on the final destination of the goods 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all criteria are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs either upon shipment by the company or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale 
sales of system upgrades are recognized as revenue upon completion of the conversion of the customer s existing system when this conversion occurs at the customer site 
revenue earned from services maintenance  installation support  and repairs is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
if any contract provides for both equipment and services multiple deliverables  the sales price is allocated to the various elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
each element is then evaluated for revenue recognition based on the previously described criteria 
the company s sales arrangements provide for no other significant post shipment obligations 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  the company defers revenue recognition 
in the event of revenue deferral  the sale value is not recorded as revenue to the company  accounts receivable are reduced by any related amounts owed by the customer  and the cost of the goods or services deferred is carried in inventory 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates whether an allowance for sales returns is necessary 
historically  the company has experienced few sales returns 
the company accounts for cash consideration such as sales incentives that are given to customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless an identified benefit is received for which fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the company believes that revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate because the company s terms of sale vary significantly  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to recognize or defer revenue based on those terms 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
at september   the company had invoiced million compared to million at september  for which the company has not recognized revenue 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  doubtful accounts based on credit profiles of customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and customers historical payment patterns 
factors that affect collectability of receivables include general economic or political factors in certain countries that affect the ability of customers to meet current obligations 
the company actively manages its credit risk by utilizing an independent credit rating and reporting service  by requiring certain percentages of down payments  and by requiring secured forms of payment for customers with uncertain credit profiles or located in certain countries 
forms of secured payment could include irrevocable letters of credit  bank guarantees  third party leasing arrangements or ex im bank guarantees  each utilizing uniform commercial code filings  or the like  with governmental entities where possible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management judgment in making assumptions relative to customer or general economic factors that are outside the company s control 
as of september   the balance sheet included allowances for doubtful accounts of  amounts charged to bad debt expense for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
actual charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
if the company experiences actual bad debt expense in excess of estimates  or if estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  the carrying value of accounts receivable would decrease and charges for bad debts would increase  resulting in decreased net earnings 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s inventory includes purchased raw materials  manufactured components  purchased components  service and repair parts  work in process  finished goods and demonstration equipment 
write downs for excess and obsolete inventories are made after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are the company s purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles and the associated product support 
the company actively manages its exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining low safety stocks and minimum purchase lots  utilizing just in time 
table of contents purchasing practices  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing to sales to production to after sale support 
at september   cumulative inventory adjustments to lower of cost or market totaled million compared to million as of september  amounts charged to expense to record inventory at lower of cost or market for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
actual charges to the cumulative inventory adjustments upon disposition or sale of inventory were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs  and a decrease to gross margins 
long lived assets 
the company regularly reviews all of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  investments and amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of these assets  an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets is recorded 
in addition  goodwill is reviewed based on its fair value at least annually 
as of september   the company held million of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  net of depreciation and amortization 
there were no changes in the company s long lived assets that would result in an adjustment of the carrying value for these assets except for an impairment charge of  related to its investment in proditec 
estimates of future cash flows arising from the utilization of these long lived assets and estimated useful lives associated with the assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generated throughout the lives of several product lines over extended periods of time  and the potential effect that recognizing an impairment could have on the assets reported on the company s balance sheet and the potential material adverse effect on reported earnings or loss 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and a reduction to net earnings in the affected period 
allowances for warranties 
the company s products are covered by standard warranty plans included in the price of the products ranging from days to five years  depending upon the product and contractual terms of sale 
the company establishes allowances for warranties for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  warranty claims based on contractual terms  product conditions and actual warranty experience by product line 
company products include both manufactured and purchased components and  therefore  warranty plans include third party sourced parts which may not be covered by the third party manufacturer s warranty 
ultimately  the warranty experience of the company is directly attributable to the quality of its products 
the company actively manages its quality program by using a structured product introduction plan  process monitoring techniques utilizing statistical process controls  vendor quality metrics  a quality training curriculum for every employee  and feedback loops to communicate warranty claims to designers and engineers for remediation in future production 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for warranties is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to significant fluctuation period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future warranty claims relative to potential unknown issues arising in both existing and new products  which assumptions are derived from historical trends of known or resolved issues  and risks associated with third party supplied components being manufactured using processes that the company does not control 
as of september   the balance sheet included warranty reserves of million  while million of warranty charges were incurred during the fiscal year then ended  compared to warranty reserves of million as of september  and warranty charges of million for the fiscal year then ended 
if the company s actual warranty costs are higher than estimates  future warranty plan coverages are different  or estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  reserves for warranty expense would need to increase  warranty expense would increase and gross margins would decrease 
accounting for income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the quarterly provision for income taxes is based partially upon estimates of pre tax financial accounting income for the full year and is affected by various differences between financial accounting income and taxable income 
judgment is also applied 
table of contents in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
in management s judgment  when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
at september   the company had valuation reserves of approximately  for deferred tax assets for capital loss carryforwards and the valuation of notes receivable related to the sale of the investment in the inspx joint venture and the valuation impairment of its investment in proditec  and offsetting amounts for us and chinese deferred tax assets and liabilities  primarily related to net operating loss carry forwards in the foreign jurisdictions that the company believe will not be utilized during the carryforward periods 
during fiscal  the company recorded  of valuation reserves related to impairment charges on its investment in proditec and reversed  of valuation reserves upon partial reversal of its valuation reserve on its note receivable from the sale of its interest in the inspx joint venture 
during fiscal   of net valuation reserves for combined us and australian deferred taxes were eliminated due to the final dissolution of the related australian entity 
there were no other valuation allowances at september  due to anticipated utilization of all the deferred tax assets as the company believes it will have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets 
the company maintains reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and various international tax jurisdictions 
potential income tax exposures include potential challenges of various tax credits and deductions  and issues specific to state and local tax jurisdictions 
exposures are typically settled primarily through audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause management of the company to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
during fiscal and  there were no significant changes in these estimates 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because it relies on significant management judgment in making assumptions relative to temporary and permanent timing differences of tax effects  estimates of future earnings  prospective application of changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions  and the resulting ability to utilize tax assets at those future dates 
if the company s operating results were to fall short of expectations  thereby affecting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of the valuation allowance required to be included in the financial statements in any given period 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance would reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  increase tax expense and reduce net earnings 
the federal research and development credit r d credit expired on december  in fiscal  the emergency economic stabilization act of was enacted 
as part of the legislation  the existing r d credit was retroactively renewed and extended to december  due to this change in tax law  the company recorded approximately  of additional r d tax credits in fiscal related to r d expenditures incurred during fiscal

this decrease occurred in almost all automated product inspection lines  except for the manta automated inspection product 
gross profits decreased to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal  or and of net sales  respectively 
the principle reason for the million decrease in gross profit relates to the 
table of contents over decrease in sales volume 
the decline in the gross profit percentage resulted primarily from factory underutilization  decreased volumes and efficiencies in manufacturing operations and increased warranty and customer support related costs 
management intends to focus on reducing warranty and customer support costs in the next fiscal year

the effective tax rate for the company was a tax benefit rate of in fiscal compared to a tax expense rate of in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily affected by the research and development r d credits recorded in fiscal including  of additional r d tax credits related to fiscal recorded due to changes in tax law during fiscal to retroactively renew the r d tax credit 
other items  such as permanent differences arising from domestic production deductions  tax exempt interest  and other permanent differences  caused the effective tax rate to vary from the statutory rate in both fiscal and net loss in fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the principal reasons for the decrease in earnings for fiscal compared to fiscal were decreased sales volumes  lower gross profit margins  and unfavorable changes in the components of other income and expense  which were partially offset by decreased operating expenses

this increase was due in large part to an almost increase in upgrade orders 
gross profits increased to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal  or and of net sales  respectively

the improvement in the gross profit percentage relates to the lower other cost of sales relating to improved manufacturing and overhead variances
