overview our overall financial performance during was mixed 
very strong performance in the first half of gave way to significantly weaker performance in the second half of the year  as the deterioration in the fundamentals of the global economy took an increasing toll on our business 
for the full year  favorable results in our cranes and materials processing mining mpm segments were more than offset by unfavorable results in our aerial work platforms awp  construction and roadbuilding  utility products and other rbuo segments 
the challenges in the current operating environment  particularly in the us and western europe  have been compounded by the unprecedented levels of instability in the financial markets that have resulted from the ongoing global credit crisis 
the awp and construction segments and the materials processing business have all experienced weakness for many of their products in these markets 
construction activity has dramatically slowed and many of our end markets have seen significant declines 
we have seen a credit crisis that initially appeared limited to the us intensify into a worldwide financial crisis in the second half of the causes of this financial and economic turbulence differ from past downturns  thus there is no historical precedent with which to compare 
the global economy remains under stress and our expectations for have deteriorated 
the depth and duration of the global economic decline are not known  however  we expect to be a very challenging year 
the current environment is one of a global slowdown  where the product and geographic diversity we have built has little ability to mitigate the market pressure we are experiencing at the moment 
while we remain confident that our strategy of product and geographic diversity is the right one to deliver positive shareholder returns in the long term  we know that the current environment presents unique challenges 
in response to the present economic environment  we have taken and will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce costs and preserve cash in all of our businesses 
these actions include the following since june  reducing our workforce  including temporary and contract workers  the awp global workforce has been reduced by approximately  the construction global workforce has been reduced by approximately  the materials processing global workforce has been reduced by approximately  the roadbuilding global workforce has been reduced by approximately  additional reductions in our workforce will continue across all segments in  temporary shutdowns of manufacturing facilities and shortened work weeks were implemented and will continue to be used to reduce production output as necessary  review of existing facilities for potential consolidation  transfer or sale  cutting production levels  eliminating salary increases in for management level team members and significantly reducing executive long term compensation from to delaying or cutting capital expenditures  reducing discretionary spending  and identifying and improving process and system efficiencies 
the marketplace for each of our businesses is somewhat different  but there is a common approach we are taking throughout the company 
in  we will be managing our business even more aggressively than normal for cash 
most of our businesses are experiencing continued reductions in incoming orders  with orders in backlog being cancelled or deferred 
we are intensely focused in each of our businesses in managing our sales  inventory and operations planning process to quickly adjust our production rate and material ordering in line with this rapidly changing market 
our construction and roadbuilding businesses are experiencing a number of significant challenges in this very difficult environment and we need to make changes to build and improve these businesses to meet these challenges 
while we would prefer to implement the necessary changes to overcome these obstacles  if different ownership would grow one or more of these businesses faster than we could  then we will consider those alternatives 
although we continued to see reasonable demand for cranes and mining equipment  we are now experiencing increasing cancellations in our backlog for crane and mining products  as well as delays in acceptance of deliveries  as our customers for these products are not immune to the effects of the economic downturn 
demand in these businesses has been driven by global infrastructure development and maintenance  as well as commodity and energy prices that were at levels which supported continued investment in capital equipment 
commodities and energy pricing generally have been weakening  so we are cautious in our expectations of future demand 
we are making select capital investments in our awp  cranes and mpm segments to more effectively and efficiently respond to anticipated market demand 
for example  we are developing new facilities in india for material processing equipment and in china for cranes  hydraulic excavators  portable products and scissor and boom lifts to reduce manufacturing costs and to meet the demand for these products in these developing regions 
year over year backlog for all of our segments is down  with awp and construction backlogs down significantly 
we have also seen recent softening demand for our materials processing  cranes and mining products 
during  the awp and construction segments experienced declines in net sales and operating income due to continued weakness in the us and western european markets 
the rbuo segment showed modest improvements in sales  as well as profitability  when compared to the prior year period 
stronger demand for utility products  coupled with cost reduction efforts in the roadbuilding business  resulted in improved profits 
input costs affected operating results in  but were in part offset by higher pricing to our customers 
input costs continue to present challenges  although they have recently moderated 
at this time  our price increases have not yet fully offset our total input cost increases 
rising input costs have had the most effect on the awp segment  with a lesser impact on the cranes and mpm segments  as these businesses tend to have longer supply contracts as well as cost escalation clauses in certain contracts with our customers 
most of our steel and other input costs have fallen from recent peak levels  but we are still experiencing higher material costs than last year 
we will not see a significant improvement in cost until later in  when we will have utilized material already in our inventory 
uncertainty around the depth and duration of the current economic decline makes it difficult to forecast our expectations for with a reasonable degree of certainty 
however  we are planning for continued softness in demand 
we expect that western european and us markets will remain soft for our aerial work platforms  construction and materials processing businesses well into we expect that for  net sales for our awp segment will be down  net sales for our construction segment will be down  net sales for our cranes segment will be down  and net sales for our mpm segment will be down  versus results 
we expect our overall net sales to decline in the range of as compared to  approximately of which is the estimated translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
given that external access to credit remains uncertain in the current financial environment  we are focusing on improving liquidity by aggressively reducing costs and working capital and slowing capital spending 
we are currently not purchasing shares under our previously announced share repurchase program 
however  during  we repurchased million  or million shares  of our common stock 
tfs provides assistance to our customers in financing purchases of our equipment  largely through the use of financial partners 
we have used the flexibility  expertise and capacity of multiple sources to secure financing in this difficult market 
in certain cases  tfs will also originate and sell financing transactions to these same financial institutions to increase velocity of transaction processing and maintain our customer linkage 
as of december   tfs retained approximately million of these assets on our balance sheet 
we have also accelerated several internal initiatives to reduce inventory  including significantly limiting raw material receipts  particularly in the aerial work platforms  construction and materials processing businesses  while carefully managing incoming inventory in our cranes and mining businesses 
we are adjusting production levels as appropriate in relation to slowing end market demand for our products 
with the actions we are taking to reduce costs and increase liquidity  we expect to have sufficient flexibility to execute our key business plans 
after tax return on invested capital roic continues to be the unifying metric we use to measure our operating performance 
roic measures how effectively we utilize the capital invested in our operations 
after tax roic is determined by dividing the sum of net operating profit after tax as defined below for each of the previous four quarters by the average of the sum of total stockholders equity plus debt as defined below less cash and cash equivalents for the previous five quarters 
net operating profit after tax nopat  which is a non gaap measure  for each quarter is calculated by multiplying income from operations by a figure equal to one minus the effective tax rate of the company 
the effective tax rate is equal to the provision for benefit from income taxes divided by income before income taxes for the respective quarter 
debt is calculated using the amounts for notes payable and current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  less current portion 
we calculate roic using the last four quarters nopat as this represents the most recent twelve month period at any given point of determination 
in order for the denominator of the roic ratio to properly match the operational period reflected in the numerator  we include the average of five quarter s ending balance sheet amounts so that the denominator includes the average of the opening through ending balances on a quarterly basis over the same time period as the numerator four quarters of average invested capital 
we use roic as a unifying metric because we feel that it measures how effectively we invest our capital and provides a better measure to compare ourselves to peer companies to assist in assessing how we drive operational improvement 
we believe that roic measures return on the full enterprise wide amount of capital invested in our business  as opposed to another metric such as return on shareholder s equity that only incorporates book equity  and is thus a more accurate and descriptive measure of our performance 
we also believe that adding debt less cash and cash equivalents to total stockholders equity provides a better comparison across similar businesses regarding total capitalization  and roic highlights the level of value creation as a percentage of capital invested 
consistent with this belief  we use roic in evaluating executive performance and compensation  as we have disclosed in the compensation discussion and analysis in our proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders 
as of october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge for goodwill of million  which represented all of the goodwill recorded in the construction and rbuo segments 
however  we do not believe that non cash impairment charges are indicative of returns on our invested capital 
therefore  we have excluded the effect of these impairment charges from the metrics used in our calculation of roic 
as the tables below show  our roic at december  was  down from at december  the decrease reflects reduced nopat performance from approximately million to approximately million and the increased invested capital impact of recent acquisitions of approximately million 
the amounts described below are reported in millions of us dollars  except for the effective tax rates

acquisitions  particularly asv and shm  contributed approximately million to the increase in net sales 
excluding the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions  our mpm and cranes segments were the primary drivers of the remaining increase in net sales and  combined  contributed approximately million to the increase  as worldwide infrastructure and commodity needs continued to provide significant demand for our products 
excluding the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions  our awp and construction segments declined by approximately million from the prior year 
we had moderate net sales growth in the rbuo segment 
while we experienced growth in net sales in the first half of of approximately over the same period in  during the second half of  net sales decreased approximately over the same period in this sharp decline was due to the significant weakening of many of our end markets in the second half of gross profit for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes contributed approximately million to gross profit 
the increase in gross profit in was driven by the strong sales in the mpm and cranes segments  which  excluding the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  combined to increase gross profit by approximately million over the prior year 
however  the awp and construction segments had lower combined gross profit of approximately million  excluding the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the rbuo segment did not provide significant contribution to the increase in gross profit due to increasing costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs increased for the year ended december  by million when compared to the same period in the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for approximately million of the sg a increase 
most of the rise in sg a costs was due to our continued investment in operational improvement initiatives  including supply chain management  global sales and service capabilities in developing markets  marketing  implementation of our enterprise resource management system  and strategic sourcing initiatives 
as of october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge for goodwill of million and represented all of the goodwill recorded in the construction and rbuo segments 
this goodwill impairment charge was necessary  as the fair value of the reporting units within these segments had significantly declined  reflecting reduced estimated future cash flows for these businesses based on lower expectations for growth and profitability  primarily as a result of the current global economic downturn 
income from operations decreased by million for the year ended december  over the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to million of impairment charges 
although  we experienced improvement in operating profit due to higher volume  pricing actions and the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  these were more than offset by transactional foreign currency losses and higher sg a costs 
while we experienced an increase in operating profit in the first half of of approximately over the same period in  during the second half of  excluding the impairment charges  operating profit decreased approximately over the same period in this sharp deterioration was primarily due to the significant declines in many of our end markets and higher input costs incurred in the second half of aerial work platforms of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales for the awp segment for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes increased net sales by approximately million

gross profit for the year ended december  increased million relative to the same period in gross profit benefited approximately million from the effect of prior pricing actions flowing through our order backlog  coupled with a higher mix of crawler and rough terrain cranes  which added approximately million 
the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on euro denominated sales improved gross margin by approximately from the prior year 
sg a costs for the year ended december  increased million over the same period in the increase was driven by higher sales costs of approximately million due to increased volume and increased allocation of corporate costs of approximately million 
approximately of the increase was due to the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
income from operations for the year ended december  increased million over the comparable period in income from operations in benefited from higher sales volume and product mix  the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes and the impact of prior pricing actions  offset in part by higher sg a expenses 
materials processing mining of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales in the mpm segment increased million over the comparable period in approximately million of the increase was due to continued solid demand for our products  particularly large mining trucks  excavators and crushing and screening products 
this demand was driven by continued high commodity prices combined with increased global mining operations  as well as european and indian demand for crushing and screening products 
pricing actions improved our sales by approximately million 
strong parts revenue also contributed approximately million of the increase 
additionally  the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for approximately of the net sales increase 
gross profit increased by million in the year ended december  over the comparable period in the increase was due to higher sales volume  including increased parts sales  and product mix  which contributed approximately million  combined with the impact of prior pricing actions of approximately million  offset in part by approximately million in higher costs for material and component purchases and approximately million in higher warranty costs 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit was unfavorably impacted by a higher proportion of mining truck sales  which have lower margin than other products in this category 
additionally  the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for approximately of the increase 
sg a costs increased by million relative to the comparable period in the increase in sg a expense was due to approximately million of additional staffing costs to support sales growth  engineering costs of approximately million for product development and supplier qualification activity  approximately million in legal costs associated with claims and investigations  as well as an additional allocation of corporate costs of million 
approximately million of higher administration costs were incurred in support of business growth 
the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes added approximately of the increase 
income from operations for the mpm segment increased million over the comparable period in the increase was a result of the items noted above  particularly higher sales volume and the impact of pricing actions  partially offset by higher sg a costs associated with the segment s growth 
roadbuilding  utility products and other of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a loss income from operations net sales for the rbuo segment for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in the decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower demand for concrete mixer trucks and other concrete products of approximately million resulting from the downturn in north american residential construction markets  offset partially by improved sales penetration in latin america of approximately million 
our utility products also experienced lower sales volume of approximately million  offset by an improved product mix and pricing increases that totaled approximately million and additional improvement of approximately million from used equipment  rental and parts sales 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in this decrease was directly correlated with the impact of lower sales volume in concrete products that affected gross profit by approximately million  offset by approximately million due to the impact of increased latin american sales in our roadbuilding business 
lower sales volume and product mix in our utilities business affected gross profit by approximately million  offset by approximately million due to the impact of used equipment and parts sales as well as improvements in other cost of sales 
sg a costs for the year ended december  increased million over the comparable period in the increase was due to approximately million in higher corporate charges to the segment and approximately million of increased selling costs incurred to expand opportunities in undeveloped territories 
we incurred write downs of approximately million primarily related to one defaulting customer of our re rental business that was wound down 
income from operations for the rbuo segment for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in the decrease reflects the items noted above  particularly lower concrete mixer truck volume combined with higher sg a costs 
corporate eliminations of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales loss from operations our consolidated results include the elimination of intercompany sales activity among segments 
corporate costs before allocations to the business segments increased  as we continued to invest in company wide initiatives  including supply management  manufacturing strategy  the terex management system  marketing  and tbs 
these initiatives  coupled with infrastructure investments to handle growth in developing markets  contributed to approximately million of costs incurred in the current year 
these charges were partially offset by an increase of approximately million in corporate costs allocated to the business segments in versus the prior year 
interest expense  net of interest income during the year ended december   our interest expense net of interest income was million  or million lower than the same period in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings outstanding during the year  resulting in lower interest expense  combined with higher average cash balances yielding higher interest income 
loss on early extinguishment of debt we recorded a pre tax charge on early extinguishment of debt of million in the year ended december   which included a million expense associated with the call premium for the repayment of million of outstanding debt on january  and million of amortization of debt acquisition costs accelerated because of this debt repayment 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge on early extinguishment of debt of million  including a million expense associated with the call premiums for the repayment of million of outstanding debt in june and august in addition  we recorded million of amortization of debt acquisition costs accelerated because of this debt repayment and the replacement of our previous credit facility 
other income expense net other income expense net for the year ended december  was income of million  an increase of million when compared to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to an increase of approximately million in foreign exchange translation gains in income taxes during the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  as compared to income tax expense of million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  in the prior year 
the effective tax rate for was lower than in the prior year  primarily due to incremental manufacturing and export incentives of million and the completion of the worldwide accrual to income tax return reconciliation  which revised and further validated our income tax balances and included an immaterial out of period adjustment of million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on our financial results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are among our most significant accounting polices which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events and which utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management judgment 
please refer to note a basis of presentation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out fifo method and the average cost method approximately and  respectively 
in valuing inventory  we are required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of used equipment taken in trade from customers requires us to use the best information available to determine the value of the equipment to potential customers 
this value is subject to change based on numerous conditions 
inventory reserves are established taking into account age  frequency of use  or sale  and in the case of repair parts  the installed base of machines 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events that could significantly influence our judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where our products are sold  new equipment price fluctuations  competitive actions  including the introduction of new products and technological advances  as well as new products and design changes we introduce 
at december   reserves for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory totaled million 
accounts receivable we are required to judge our ability to collect accounts receivable from our customers 
valuation of receivables includes evaluating customer payment histories  customer leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
at december   reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million 
given current economic conditions  there can be no assurance that our historical accounts receivable collection experience will be indicative of future results 
guarantees we have issued guarantees to financial institutions of customer financing to purchase equipment as of december  we must assess the probability of losses or non performance in ways similar to the evaluation of accounts receivable  including consideration of a customer s payment history  leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
to date  losses related to guarantees have been negligible 
our customers  from time to time  may fund acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company  by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  we have generally been able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by terex demag gmbh  part of the cranes segment  and genie holdings  inc and its affiliates genie  part of the aerial work platforms segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
given current economic conditions  there can be no assurance that our historical credit default experience will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in effect at the time of loss 
we issue residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note t litigations and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by genie  of million 
we are able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we record a liability for the estimated fair value of guarantees issued pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards nos 
 and and rescission of fin fin no 

we recognize a loss under a guarantee when our obligation to make payment under the guarantee is probable and the amount of the loss can be estimated 
a loss would be recognized if our payment obligation under the guarantee exceeds the value we can expect to recover to offset such payment  primarily through the sale of the equipment underlying the guarantee 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and retirement plans and other in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  given current economic conditions  there can be no assurances that our historical experience in used equipment markets will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in the used equipment markets at the time of loss 
revenue recognition revenue and costs are generally recorded when products are shipped and invoiced to either independently owned and operated dealers or to customers 
revenue generated in the united states is recognized when title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers  which occurs upon shipment when terms are fob shipping point which is customary and upon delivery when terms are fob destination 
we also have a policy requiring that certain criteria be met in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d we have no significant obligations for future performance 
in the united states  we have the ability to enter into a security agreement and receive a security interest in the product by filing an appropriate uniform commercial code ucc financing statement 
however  a significant portion of our revenue is generated outside of the united states 
in many countries outside of the united states  as a matter of statutory law  a seller retains title to a product until payment is made 
the laws do not provide for a seller s retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the ucc 
in these countries  we retain title to goods delivered to a customer until the customer makes payment so that we can recover the goods in the event of customer default on payment 
in these circumstances  where we only retain title to secure our recovery in the event of customer default  we also have a policy  which requires meeting certain criteria in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  e we have no significant obligations for future performance  and f we are not entitled to direct the disposition of the goods  cannot rescind the transaction  cannot prohibit the customer from moving  selling  or otherwise using the goods in the ordinary course of business and have no other rights of holding title that rest with a titleholder of property that is subject to a lien under the ucc 
in circumstances where the sales transaction requires acceptance by the customer for items such as testing on site  installation  trial period or performance criteria  revenue is not recognized unless the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  and e the customer has given their acceptance  the time period for acceptance has elapsed or we have otherwise objectively demonstrated that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
in addition to performance commitments  we analyze factors such as the reason for the purchase to determine if revenue should be recognized 
this analysis is done before the product is shipped and includes the evaluation of factors that may affect the conclusion related to the revenue recognition criteria as follows a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease 
income from operating leases is recognized ratably over the term of the lease 
we routinely sell equipment subject to operating leases and the related lease payments 
if we do not retain a substantial risk of ownership in the equipment  the transaction is recorded as a sale 
if we do retain a substantial risk of ownership  the transaction is recorded as a borrowing  the operating lease payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease and the debt is amortized over a similar period 
we  from time to time  issue buyback guarantees in conjunction with certain sales agreements 
these primarily relate to trade value agreements tvas in which a customer may trade in equipment in the future at a stated price credit  if certain conditions are met by the customer 
the trade in price credit is determined at the time of the original sale of equipment 
in conjunction with the trade in  these conditions include a requirement to purchase new equipment at fair market value at the time of trade in  which fair value is required to be of equal or greater value than the original equipment cost 
other conditions also include the general functionality and state of repair of the machine 
we have concluded that any credit provided to customers under a tva buyback guarantee  which is expected to be equal to or less than the fair value of the equipment returned on the trade in date  is a guarantee to be accounted for in accordance with fin no 
the original sale of equipment  accompanied by a buyback guarantee  is a multiple element transaction wherein we offer our customer the right  after some period of time  for a limited period of time  to exchange purchased equipment for a fixed price trade in credit toward another of our products 
the fixed price trade in credit is accounted for under the guidance provided by fin no 
pursuant to this right  we have agreed to make a payment in the form of a trade in credit to the customer contingent upon the customer exercising its right to trade in the original purchased equipment 
under the guidance of fin no 
 we record the fixed price trade in credit at its fair value 
accordingly  as noted above  we have accounted for the trade in credit as a separate deliverable in a multiple element arrangement 
goodwill goodwill  representing the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets tangible and intangible and liabilities at the date of acquisition  is reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently as circumstances warrant  and written down only in the period in which the recorded value of such assets exceed their fair value 
we do not amortize goodwill  in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we selected october as the date for our required annual impairment test 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information with similar economic characteristics is available and the operating results are regularly reviewed by our management 
our seven reporting units are contained within the five operating segments 
our mpm and rbuo segments each include two reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use an income approach derived from the discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
the aggregate fair value of our reporting units is compared to our market capitalization on the valuation date to assess its reasonableness 
the initial recognition of goodwill  as well as the annual review of the carrying value of goodwill  requires that we develop estimates of future business performance 
these estimates are used to derive expected cash flow and include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support a given business 
we rely on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
the discounted cash flow model also includes a determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
the cost of capital is based on assumptions about interest rates as well as a risk adjusted rate of return required by our equity investors 
changes in these estimates can impact the present value of the expected cash flow that is used in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets as well as the overall expected value of a given business 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
there were no indicators of goodwill impairment in the tests performed as of october  and as a result of our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  our construction and rbuo segments recorded non cash charges of million to reflect impairment of goodwill in these reporting units  which represented all of the goodwill recorded in the construction and rbuo segments 
see note l goodwill in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  the company applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
this hypothetical decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value for the remaining reporting units not impaired as of december  impairment of long lived assets our policy is to assess the realizability of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
we rely on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
there are no assurances that future cash flow assumptions will be achieved 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
due to adverse market conditions and the lower expectations for growth and profitability in the construction and rbuo segments  we performed an evaluation of our long lived assets as of december  we did not have any impairment for the years ended december   and accrued warranties we record accruals for unasserted warranty claims based on our prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
however  adjustments to the initial warranty accrual are recorded if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the performance of new products  models and technology  changes in weather conditions for product operation  different uses for products and other similar factors 
accrued product liability we record accruals for product liability claims when deemed probable and estimable based on facts and circumstances  and our prior claim experience 
accruals for product liability claims are valued based upon our prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside legal counsel  analysis of internal product liability counsel and the experience of our director of product safety 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables such as the decisions of juries or judges 
defined benefit plans pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
as of december   we maintained one qualified defined benefit pension plan and one nonqualified plan covering certain us employees 
the benefits covering salaried employees are based primarily on years of service and employees qualifying compensation during the final years of employment 
the benefits covering bargaining unit employees are based primarily on years of service and a flat dollar amount per year of service 
participation in the qualified plan is frozen and participants are only credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and retirement eligibility 
it is our policy  generally  to fund the qualified us plan based on the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act of the nonqualified plan provides retirement benefits to certain senior executives of the company and is unfunded 
generally  the nonqualified plan provides a benefit based on average total compensation earned over a participant s final five years of employment and years of service reduced by benefits earned under any company retirement program excluding salary deferrals and matching contributions 
participation in the nonqualified plan was frozen effective december   however  eligible participants are credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and the amount of benefits 
we maintain defined benefit plans in germany  france  china  india and the united kingdom for some of our subsidiaries 
the plans in germany  france  india and china are unfunded plans 
plan assets consist primarily of common stocks  bonds  and short term cash equivalent funds 
for the us plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities and are in fixed income securities 
for the uk funded plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities  are in fixed income securities and in real estate 
this allocation is reviewed periodically and updated to meet the long term goals of the plan 
determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated expenses requires the use of actuarial valuations to estimate the benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefits 
we use the services of independent actuaries to assist with these calculations 
inherent in these valuations are economic assumptions including expected returns on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities may be settled  rates of increase of health care costs  rates of future compensation increases as well as employee demographic assumptions such as retirement patterns  mortality and turnover 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions used are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses 
unrecognized gains and losses that exceed percent of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets are amortized to earnings over the shorter of the estimated future service period of the plan participants or the period until any anticipated final plan settlements 
the assumptions used in the actuarial models are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect experience 
we believe the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which we operate 
expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for the us plan and for the us plans at december  our strategy with regard to the investments in the pension plans is to earn a rate of return sufficient to match or exceed the long term growth of pension liabilities 
the expected rate of return of plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on the investment portfolio 
these rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends  historical portfolio performance and the portfolio mix of investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
the discount rates for pension plan liabilities were for us plans and to for international plans at december  the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at the december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects on the subsequent year 
a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the expected rates of compensation increase for our international pension plans were to at december  these estimated annual compensation increases are determined by management every year and are based on historical trends and market indices 
we have recorded the underfunded status on our balance sheet as a liability and the unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains losses as a reduction in stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
the change in assumptions from the previous year  primarily increases in the discount rate  resulted in a net decrease in the projected benefit obligation of million 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the market value of plan assets can change significantly in a relatively short period of time 
additionally  the measurement of plan benefit obligations is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as a result  if the equity market declines and or interest rates decrease  the plans estimated benefit obligations could increase  causing an increase in liabilities and a reduction in stockholders equity 
we expect that any future obligations under our plans that are not currently funded will be funded from future cash flows from operations 
if our contributions are insufficient to adequately fund the plans to cover our future obligations  or if the performance of the assets in our plans does not meet expectations  or if our assumptions are modified  contributions could be higher than expected  which would reduce the cash available for our business 
changes in us or foreign laws governing these plans could require additional contributions 
in addition  changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could require the recording of additional liabilities and costs related to these plans 
the assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension expense and projected benefit obligation  respectively  as of and for the year ended december  increase decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return discount rate expected long term rate of return amounts in millions u 
s 
plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation foreign plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes we estimate income taxes based on enacted tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which represent future tax benefits or obligations of the company 
these deferred income tax balances arise from temporary differences due to divergent treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes 
we evaluate deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character  amount and timing to result in the use of our deferred tax assets 
character refers to the type capital gain vs 
ordinary income as well as the source foreign vs 
domestic of the income we generate 
timing refers to the period in which future income is expected to be generated 
timing is important because net operating losses nols in certain jurisdictions expire if not used within an established statutory time frame 
based on these evaluations  we have determined that it is more likely than not that expected future earnings will be sufficient to use most of our deferred tax assets 
we do not provide for us federal income taxes or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings or losses of our international subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested and  in our opinion  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
if earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not considered indefinitely reinvested  deferred us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes may have to be provided 
however  determination of the amount of deferred federal and foreign income taxes is not practical 
judgments and estimates are required to determine tax expense and deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters 
tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge tax filing positions we take 
our practice is to file income tax returns that conform to the requirements of each jurisdiction and to record provisions for tax liabilities  including interest and penalties in accordance with fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no

as our business has grown in geographic scope  size and complexity  so has our potential exposure to uncertain tax positions 
given the subjective nature of applicable tax law  the results of an audit of any tax return could have a significant impact on our financial statements

we do not expect that fsp fas no 
r will have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
liquidity and capital resources our main sources of funding are cash generated from operations  loans from our bank credit facility and funds raised in capital markets 
we believe that cash generated from our operations  together with access to our bank credit facility and our cash on hand  provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  in addition  we had million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility at december  we have no significant debt maturities until  however  we have increased our focus on internal cash flow generation in a time when access to external capital markets is less certain 
our actions include reducing costs and working capital and suspending our share repurchase program in an effort to maintain liquidity in view of current conditions in the economy and credit markets 
we believe these measures  in conjunction with our actions to delay certain capital spending projects  will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our key business plans and comply with our financial covenants under our bank credit facility 
however  if we were unable to comply with these covenants  there would be a default under our bank credit facility and  if such default was not waived by our lenders  this could result in acceleration of the amounts owed under the bank credit facility 
in such event  we would have to repay or refinance such debt 
at december   we had sufficient cash to pay such debt  however  such payment would have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity 
if we were unable to repay or refinance such debt  this could possibly result in acceleration of the payment obligation for our other long term debt 
in  we will be managing our business even more aggressively than normal for cash 
most of our businesses are experiencing continued reductions in incoming orders  with orders in backlog being cancelled or deferred 
we are intensely focused in each of our businesses in managing our sales  inventory and operations planning process to quickly adjust our production rate and material ordering in line with this rapidly changing market 
generating cash from operations depends primarily on our ability to earn net income through sales of our products and manage our investment in working capital 
we continue to focus on collecting receivables in a timely manner 
consistent with past practice  each quarter we sell receivables to various third party financial institutions through several pre arranged facilities 
during the fourth quarter of and  we sold  without recourse  accounts receivable approximating and of our fourth quarter revenue  respectively  to provide additional liquidity 
the discontinuance of these facilities could reduce our liquidity 
even though inventory levels have risen  we remain focused on increasing inventory turns by sharing  throughout our company  many of the best practices and lean manufacturing processes that several of our business units have implemented successfully 
despite high current levels of inventory  substantial effort has gone into reviewing and improving our materials planning and forecasting methods 
we expect these initiatives to reduce the level of inventory needed to support our business and allow us to reduce our manufacturing lead times  thereby reducing our working capital requirements 
we are currently adjusting production and incoming material levels as appropriate to reflect slowing end market demand for our products 
actions have been taken to slow  and in some cases stop  production in response to declining demand 
we believe adjusting production levels and curtailing incoming material in our aerial work platforms  construction and materials processing businesses will reduce inventory levels further  and we will carefully manage incoming material in the cranes and mining businesses as well to match the demand expectations of these businesses 
however  in these uncertain economic times  we will remain vigilant of our inventory levels and are prepared to take additional actions if the above actions do not result in a reduction in our inventory 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to numerous factors  including the following many of our customers fund their purchases through third party finance companies that extend credit based on the credit worthiness of the customers and the expected residual value of our equipment 
changes either in the customers credit profile or in used equipment values may impact the ability of customers to purchase equipment 
given current economic conditions and the lack of liquidity in the global credit markets  there can be no assurance that third party finance companies will continue to extend credit to our customers as they have in the past 
as our sales levels change  the absolute amount of working capital needed to support our business may change 
we insure and sell a portion of our accounts receivable to third party finance companies that are not obligated to purchase accounts receivable from us  and may choose to limit or discontinue further purchases from us at any time 
changes in customers credit worthiness  the market for credit insurance or the willingness of third party finance companies to purchase accounts receivable from us may impact our cash flow from operations 
our suppliers extend payment terms to us based on our overall credit rating 
declines in our credit rating may impact suppliers willingness to extend terms and in turn increase the cash requirements of our business 
sales of our products are subject to general economic conditions  weather  competition and the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  and other factors that in many cases are outside our direct control 
for example  during periods of economic uncertainty  our customers may delay purchasing decisions  which could have a negative impact on cash generated from operations 
currently  the financial markets are experiencing significant turbulence  and we expect that this will continue to slow world economic growth over the near term 
while we believe the actions taken by governments and central banks will eventually lead to an economic recovery  the depth and duration of the economic decline and the timing and strength of the recovery are very uncertain 
many of our customers have delayed or cancelled orders and we anticipate that they may continue to delay capital spending over the near term 
we negotiate  when possible  advance payments from our customers for products with long lead times to help fund the substantial working capital investment in these products 
in  we used cash from operations in the first quarter and generated cash from operations in the rest of the year 
we expect our cash flow performance for to be heavily influenced by our ability to reduce working capital  driven by efficiency improvements  easing of supplier constraints and reductions of incoming materials and finished goods inventory 
to help fund our significant cash expenditures during the year  we have maintained cash balances and a revolving line of credit in addition to term borrowings from our bank group 
our bank credit facility provides us with a revolving line of credit of up to million that is available through july  and term debt of million that will mature on july  the revolving line of credit consists of million of available domestic revolving loans and million of available multicurrency revolving loans 
the credit facility also provides for incremental loan commitments of up to million  which may be extended at the option of the lenders  in the form of revolving credit loans  term loans or a combination of both 
although we believe that the banks under our credit facility have adequate capital and resources  we can provide no assurance that all of these banks will continue to operate as a going concern in the future 
if any of the banks in our lending group were to fail  it is possible that the borrowing capacity under our credit facility would be reduced 
in the event that the availability under our credit facility was reduced significantly  we could be required to obtain capital from alternate sources in order to finance our capital needs 
our bank credit facility requires compliance with a number of covenants 
these covenants require us to meet certain financial tests  namely a to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio not in excess of to on the last day of any fiscal quarter  and b to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to excluding share repurchases made in for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on march  and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to excluding share repurchases made in for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on june  the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio threshold lowers to to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending between july  and march  and increases to to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or after april  the covenants also limit  in certain circumstances  our ability to take a variety of actions  including incur indebtedness  create or maintain liens on our property or assets  make investments  loans and advances  engage in acquisitions  mergers  consolidations and asset sales  and pay dividends and distributions  including share repurchases 
our bank credit facility also contains customary events of default 
while we complied with all of our financial covenants under the bank credit facility as of december   we sought and received an amendment to our credit facility on february  this amendment was necessary because of continued deteriorating business conditions in certain of our operating segments and the impact of historical fixed charges incurred on a trailing twelve months basis for example  interest expense  cash taxes  share repurchases and capital expenditures causing us to believe there was a likelihood that we would be in violation of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under our credit facility as early as the end of the first quarter of without such an amendment 
the amendment revises the threshold of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio from to to the ratios described above and generally caps at million the amount of share repurchases we can make in each of the first two quarters of the amendment also raises the interest rates charged under our bank credit facility by basis points and includes a provision that would increase the interest rates charged under our bank credit facility by an additional basis points if we fail to achieve a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to for certain quarterly periods in and the amendment also includes certain other technical changes 
our future compliance with our financial covenants under the bank credit facility will depend on our ability to generate earnings and manage our assets effectively 
our bank credit facility also has various non financial covenants  requiring us to refrain from taking certain actions as described above and requiring us to take certain actions  such as keeping in good standing our corporate existence  maintaining insurance  and providing our bank lending group with financial information on a timely basis 
the interest rates charged under our bank credit facility are subject to adjustment based on our consolidated leverage ratio and our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding portion of the revolving credit component under our bank credit facility was on the million balance at december  we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our revolver at december  the weighted average interest rate on the term loans under the bank credit facility was and at december  and  respectively 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a balance between fixed and floating rate debt  including the use of interest rate derivatives when appropriate 
over the long term  we believe this mix will produce lower interest cost than a purely fixed rate mix without substantially increasing risk 
we anticipate that acquisitions will be a part of our long term growth strategy  but recent volatility in the financial markets  the downturn in global economic conditions and limited access to capital may slow acquisition activity in the near term 
we intend to use a portion of our liquidity to judiciously fund internal expansion activities  including capital expenditures 
on february   we acquired asv for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
we also completed smaller acquisitions during that  taken together  had an aggregate purchase price of less than million 
in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common shares through june  in december  our board of directors increased the share repurchase program by million  bringing the total amount that may be repurchased to million  and extended the expiration date for the program through june  in july  our board of directors increased the program by million  bringing the total amount that may be repurchased through june   to billion 
during  we repurchased million shares for million under this program 
in total  we have repurchased million shares for approximately million through december   under this program 
we are not currently purchasing shares due to volatility in the credit markets and our desire to maintain liquidity 
recent deterioration in the securities markets has reduced the value of certain assets included in our defined benefit pension plans  the effect of which has not been reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
there is the potential that the assumptions we have used will differ materially from actual results 
declines in the value of plan assets could impact stockholders equity and result in increased total pension costs for as compared to total pension costs incurred during further declines in the value of plan assets may result in the need for additional cash contributions during in accordance with funding requirements 
our ability to access the capital markets to raise funds  through the sale of equity or debt securities  is subject to various factors  some specific to us  and others related to general economic and or financial market conditions 
these include results of operations  projected operating results for future periods and debt to equity leverage 
in july  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to allow for easier access to the capital markets 
currently  due to the high degree of uncertainty in capital markets  our access to these markets is limited  and will likely continue to be limited until market stability re emerges 
our ability to access the capital markets is also subject to our timely filing of periodic reports with the sec 
in addition  the terms of our bank credit facility and senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to make further borrowings and to sell substantial portions of our assets 
cash flows vs 
cash provided by operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  in  we used approximately million more cash for working capital than we did in in  we received approximately million less cash for customer advance payments than we did in  which included several large prepayments of equipment orders  which were delivered in the current year 
in  we had approximately million lower net income than in  primarily due to non cash impairment charges of million 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million or million more than cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of asv for approximately million net of cash acquired  as well as higher capital expenditures partially supporting capacity expansion 
in  we acquired shm for approximately million 
we used cash from financing activities of million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  of million 
we used million more cash during than in to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our  million share repurchase program 
in  we issued million principal amount of long term debt  which was partially offset by the redemption of million principal amount of long term debt 
contractual obligations the following table sets out our specified contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total committed year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments total purchase commitments include non cancellable and cancellable commitments 
in many cases  cancellable commitments contain penalty provisions for cancellation 
long term debt obligations include expected interest expense 
interest expense is calculated using fixed interest rates for indebtedness that has fixed rates and the implied forward rates as of december  for indebtedness that has floating interest rates 
as of december   our liability for uncertain income tax positions was million 
we expect to pay approximately million of this liability during due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the remaining liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
additionally  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million and had issued million in credit guarantees of customer financing to purchase equipment  million in residual value guarantees and million in buyback guarantees 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
it is our policy to fund the retirement plans at the minimum level required by applicable regulations 
in  we made cash contributions and payments to the retirement plans of million  and we estimate that our retirement plan contributions will be approximately million in off balance sheet arrangements guarantees our customers  from time to time  may fund the acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company  by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  we have generally been able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million including total credit guarantees issued by terex demag gmbh  part of our cranes segment  and genie  part of our aerial work platforms segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
given current financial and economic conditions  there can be no assurance that historical credit default experience will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in effect at the time of loss 
we issue  from time to time  residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note t litigation and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million 
we are able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and retirement plans and other in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  given current economic conditions  there can be no assurance that our historical experience in used equipment markets will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in the used equipment markets at the time of loss 
variable interest entities on september   we sold our forty percent interest in terex financial services holding bv tfsh  our joint venture originally entered into on september   to the european financial institution which owned the majority sixty percent interest in tfsh 
tfsh facilitated the financing of our products sold in certain areas of europe 
as defined by fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 tfsh was a variable interest entity 
based on the legal  financial and operating structure of tfsh  we had concluded that we were not the primary beneficiary of tfsh and that we did not control the operations of tfsh 
accordingly  we did not consolidate the results of tfsh into our consolidated financial results 
we applied the equity method of accounting for our investment in tfsh 
the sale of tfsh resulted in a loss of million  which was recorded in other income expense 
sale leaseback transactions our rental business typically rents equipment to customers for periods of no less than three months 
to better match cash outflows in the rental business to cash inflows from customers  we finance the equipment through a series of sale leasebacks  which are classified as operating leases 
the leaseback period is typically months in duration 
at december   the historical cost of equipment being leased back from the financing companies was approximately million and the minimum lease payment in will be approximately million 
contingencies and uncertainties foreign currencies and interest rate risk our products are sold in over countries around the world and  accordingly  our revenues are generated in foreign currencies  while the costs associated with those revenues are only partly incurred in the same currencies 
the major foreign currencies  among others  in which we do business are the euro and british pound 
we may  from time to time  hedge specifically identified committed cash flows or forecasted cash flows in foreign currencies using forward currency sale or purchase contracts 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of  million 
we manage exposure to interest rates by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintaining an on going balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness using interest rate swaps when necessary 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below  for a discussion of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates may have on our financial performance 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due the notes to floating rates 
the floating rate is based on a spread of over libor 
at december   the floating rate was 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due the notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and are amortizing it through the debt maturity date 
other we are subject to a number of contingencies and uncertainties including  without limitation  product liability claims  self insurance obligations  tax examinations  guarantees and the matters described above in item legal proceedings 
many of the exposures are unasserted or proceedings are at a preliminary stage  and it is not presently possible to estimate the amount or timing of any of our costs 
however  we do not believe that these contingencies and uncertainties will  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on us 
when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and possible to make reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to such matters  a provision is recorded for the amount of such estimate or for the minimum amount of a range of estimates when it is not possible to estimate the amount within the range that is most likely to occur 
we generate hazardous and non hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations 
as a result  we are subject to a wide range of federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  and also require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances  should any of such events occur 
no such incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations 
compliance with such laws and regulations has required  and will continue to require  us to make expenditures 
we do not expect that these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our business or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
see note m derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial instruments 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases and sales  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  we are exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus functional currencies of our major markets  which include the euro and british pound 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows  identify naturally offsetting positions and purchase hedging instruments to protect anticipated exposures 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately  million 
the fair market value of these arrangements  which represents the cost to settle these contracts  was a net loss of million at december  at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis on the effect that aggregate changes in the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes would have on our operating income 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies outside the us by to amounts already incorporated in the financial statements for the year ended december   would have decreased the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes already included in our reported operating income by approximately million in interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposure includes movements in the us prime rate and libor 
we manage interest rate risk by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintain an on going balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness through the use of interest rate swaps when necessary 
at december   approximately of our debt was floating rate debt and the weighted average interest rate for all debt was 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our notes to floating rates 
the floating rate is based on a spread of over libor 
at december   the floating rate was 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and are amortizing it through the debt maturity date 
at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis for our derivatives and other financial instruments that have interest rate risk 
we calculated the pretax earnings effect on our interest sensitive instruments 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that an increase of in our average floating interest rates at december  would have increased interest expense by approximately million in commodities risk principal materials and components that we use in our various manufacturing processes include steel  castings  engines  tires  hydraulics  cylinders  drive trains  electric controls and motors  and a variety of other commodities and fabricated or manufactured items 
extreme movements in the cost and availability of these materials and components may affect our performance 
worldwide steel prices rose for most of in response to higher demand caused by continued higher consumption in developing market countries such as china 
due to the continued high demand for steel in  many suppliers of steel  castings and other products increased prices or added surcharges to the price of their products 
a weakening of steel prices at the end of  particularly in the commodity grades  will likely result in lower steel costs in however  we will not realize a significant improvement in our costs until later in  when we will have utilized material already in our inventory 
in the absence of labor strikes or other unusual circumstances  substantially all materials and components are normally available from multiple suppliers 
however  certain of our businesses receive materials and components from a sole supplier  although alternative suppliers of such materials are generally available 
current and potential suppliers are evaluated on a regular basis on their ability to meet our requirements and standards 
we actively manage our material supply sourcing  and may employ various methods to limit risk associated with commodity cost fluctuations and availability 
the inability of suppliers  especially any sole suppliers for a particular business  to deliver materials and components promptly could result in production delays and increased costs to manufacture our products 
as a result of the macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the us and other parts of the world  our suppliers may experience serious cash flow problems  and as a result  could seek to significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output 
we have designed and implemented plans to mitigate the impact of these risks by using alternate suppliers  leveraging our overall purchasing volumes to obtain favorable quantities and developing a closer working relationship with key suppliers 
we continue to search for acceptable alternative supply sources and less expensive supply options on a regular basis  including by improving the globalization of our supply base and using suppliers in china and india 
one key terex business system initiative has been developing and implementing world class capability in supply chain management  logistics and global purchasing 
we are focusing on gaining efficiencies with suppliers based on our global purchasing power and resources
