item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business trends our corporate structure includes separate pay per transaction ppt and advanced media and information ami operating divisions and  accordingly  we report certain financial information by individual segment under this structure 
our ppt division focuses on managing our business operations that facilitate the delivery of home entertainment content products dvds  blu ray discs  etc 
units and related rental and sales information for the content to home video specialty stores and other retailers  on a revenue sharing basis 
we lease product from various suppliers  typically motion picture studios 
under our ppt system  retailers sublease that product from us and rent it to consumers 
retailers then share a portion of the revenue from each retail rental transaction with us and we share a portion of the revenue with the studio 
since we collect  process and analyze rental and sales information at the title level  we report that information to both the studio and the respective retailers 
our ppt division also includes our traditional and digital direct revenue sharing drs services  which encompasses the collection  tracking  auditing and reporting of transaction and revenue data generated by drs retailers  such as blockbuster entertainment  movie gallery and netflix  to our respective drs clients under established agreements on a fee for service basis 
our ami division concentrates on the management and growth of our essentials suite of business information services 
our essentials suite software and services  offered primarily on a recurring subscription basis  provide unique data collection  management  analysis and reporting functions  resulting in business information valuable to our clients 
the ppt division the financial results from the ppt division continue to be affected by the changing dynamics in the home video rental market as well as overall economic trends and conditions 
this market is highly competitive and influenced greatly by consumer spending patterns and behaviors 
the end consumer has a wide variety of choices from which to select their entertainment content and can easily shift from one provider to another 
some examples include renting units of product from our participating retailers or other retailers  purchasing previously viewed units from our participating retailers or other retailers  ordering product via online subscriptions and or online distributors mail delivery  renting or purchasing product from kiosk locations  subscribing to at home movie channels  downloading or streaming content via the internet  purchasing and owning the unit directly  or selecting an at home pay per view or on demand option from a satellite or cable provider 
our ppt system focuses on the traditional brick and mortar retailer 
we believe that our system successfully addresses the many choices available to consumers and affords our participating retailers the opportunity to stock their stores with a wider selection of titles and a greater supply of popular box office releases 
many of our arrangements are structured so that the participating retailers pay minimal upfront fees and lower per transaction fees in exchange for ordering units of all titles offered by a particular program supplier referred to as output programs 
since these programs usually result in more overall units rented  our participating retailers revenue and the corresponding share with the studios also increase 
in an effort to stabilize and maintain our current level of overall ppt revenue and earnings  we have implemented strategies to obtain new participating retailers  as well as assist in the retention and growth of our current participating retailers 
the popularity of other choices an end consumer has to obtain entertainment content has been growing and our participating retailers market share has been negatively affected 
thus  for the foreseeable future  we expect their market share to experience low to mid single digit annual percentage declines and we are evaluating other initiatives to offset the effect this trend has on our ppt revenue and earnings 
we continue to be in good standing with our program suppliers and we make on going efforts to strengthen those business relationships through enhancements to our current service offerings and the development of new service offerings  such as the addition of blu ray product 

table of contents we are also continually seeking to develop business relationships with new program suppliers 
our relationships with program suppliers typically may be terminated without cause upon thirty days written notice by either party 
ami and other divisions we continue to allocate significant resources towards our business information service offerings  both those services that are currently operational as well as those that are in various stages of development 
our suite of business information services has been well received in the various targeted markets to date  as our offerings fit well with the needs identified by those market participants 
our essentials business information service offerings which are fully operational and no longer in significant stages of development  realized a revenue increase of in fiscal compared to fiscal the ami lines of business which contribute most of the revenues currently are box office essentials  which reports domestic and international gross receipt theatrical ticket sales  and ondemand essentials  which measures and reports anonymous video on demand vod usage data 
additionally  we are making significant investments in tv essentials  which provides our clients with the ability to analyze anonymous audience viewing of programming and advertising across linear and interactive television  vod and digital video recorder dvr 
box office essentials primarily reports domestic and international theatrical gross receipt ticket sales to motion picture studios and movie theater owners 
rentrak provides studios with access to box office performance data pertaining to specific motion pictures and movie theater circuits  both real time and historical 
data is currently collected for virtually all movie theaters in north america  guam and puerto rico and is primarily obtained via electronic connectivity to theater box offices 
we continue to make on going efforts to strengthen our business relationships with our existing clients as well as focus on our syndication services and international expansion plans 
ondemand essentials provides cable operators  content providers including broadcast cable networks and studios and advertisers with a transactional tracking and reporting system to view and analyze the viewership of on demand content 
during fiscal  we added thirteen new content providers to our ondemand essentials roster of subscribers  including fx  indemand networks  magnolia pictures and spike tv for a total of over ondemand essentials service clients to date 
we currently have multiple system operators msos  including the top msos who offer video on demand programming  representing over million set top boxes  supporting our ondemand essentials services 
we are well positioned to grow this business by adding new clients and adjusting rates as the business activity increases and as advanced advertising technology is rolled out by the industry 
through a recent  new partnership with seachange international  the leading provider of video on demand and iptv software  rentrak and seachange will provide a seamless process for dynamic video on demand ad insertion  verification and reporting 
together  the companies will integrate solutions to dramatically improve the ability of msos  networks and advertisers to monetize vod advertising on a regional and national basis 
advanced tv advertising includes vod  requests for information rfis  long form showcases  dvr advertising  interactive program guide advertising  addressable advertising  creative versioning and advanced trafficking systems 
tv essentials comprehensive suite of research tools enables customers to analyze anonymous audience viewing of programming and advertising across linear and interactive television  video on demand and dvr across all three tv platforms cable  satellite and telecommunications 
utilizing proprietary technology to process massive amounts of click stream data  our tv essentials system is able to aggregate and report second by second information from million digital set top boxes 
today  based on data from our current operator partners  we are translating viewing patterns from over million digital set top boxes into insights for our clients and we expect success in this area to continue and increase its rate of growth 
we are making good progress on expanding our data partners for our tv essentials services from our commercial relationships today with at t and charter communications 
in addition to those partners  we also have a relationship with dish network dish to provide tv essentials for their internal use for a 
table of contents subscription fee as we work toward commercialization of that relationship 
the dish relationship has resulted in the creation of our dvr and itv reporting  which can be rolled out to other partners as the data to drive those services becomes available to us 
we are also working on securing national ad occurrence data in order to launch the ad module of tv essentials services as well as build research capabilities to begin creating syndicated products for our measurement service 
rentrak recently entered into tv essentials customer relationships with our first two networks  the inspiration network and hdnet 
a version of the system designed specifically for local stations is also in beta trials with several network groups 
we continue new product development for other component products as we work toward measuring and comparing entertainment consumption across multiple platforms  which will help us expand our multi screen essentials suite of services

online video essentials is being developed to measure and analyze advertiser supported online video usage across the internet 
we intend to continue to invest in our existing  as well as new  business information services in the near term as we expand the markets we serve and our service lines 
the cost of these investments will likely lower our earnings in the short term 
longer term  we believe these services will provide significant future revenue and earnings streams and contribute to our overall success

the timing of new releases tends to fluctuate from studio to studio 
in addition  a new program supplier began providing product in fiscal these factors were partially offset by a decline in the number of participating retailers from the prior year and a decline in the average quantity of product ordered per theatrical release due to the mix of product and economic factors 
the decrease in volume in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an overall weakness in the quality of titles released in fiscal compared to fiscal and the decline in volume due to the significant reduction of units received from one of our major program suppliers during fiscal this program supplier represented  and  respectively  of our total revenues during fiscal  and fees per unit are affected by our mix of units received from program suppliers with varying rates of upfront fees and tend to fluctuate from period to period 
transaction fees decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the transaction fee revenue decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decline in rental transactions offset by a shift in mix to studios with more guarantees 
rental transactions declined due to the overall market conditions  including changes in consumer behavior  technological advances in entertainment content delivery and the perceived value of other alternatives 
the rate per transaction increased by due to the timing and magnitude of guarantees 
the guaranteed rate per unit drives rates up during the first month of the rental cycle 
when there are fewer guarantees or more guarantee units reach the second and third months of the rental cycle  rates per transaction decrease 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower rental transactions

ami division revenues from our ami division increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal and million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the box office essentials revenues increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily the result of an increase in syndication client revenue  as the result of adding new clients  and rate increases for existing accounts 
the ondemand essentials revenues increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal mostly attributable to additional new client subscriptions  custom enhancements made for specific clients and rate increases for existing accounts 
revenues related to our essentials business information service offerings have increased primarily due to our continued investment in and successful marketing of these offerings and successful retention of clients 
we expect continued future increases in these essentials revenues as well  as a result of further investments and additional successful launches of those services 
other division we did not have any revenues from our other division in fiscal  or cost of sales cost of sales consists of order processing costs  transaction costs  sell through costs  handling and freight costs in the ppt division and costs in the ami division associated with certain essentials business information service offerings 
these expenditures represent the direct costs to produce revenues 
in the ppt division  order processing costs  transaction costs and sell through costs represent the amounts due to the program suppliers that hold the distribution rights to the units 
freight costs represent the cost to pick  pack and ship orders of units to the participating retailers 
our cost of sales can also be impacted by the release dates of units with guarantees 
we recognize the guaranteed minimum costs on the release date 
the terms of some of our agreements result in cost of sales on titles in the first month in which the unit is released  which results in lower margins during the initial portion of the revenue sharing period 
once the unit s rental activity exceeds the required amount for these guaranteed minimums  margins generally expand during the second and third months of the unit s revenue sharing period 
however  since these factors are highly dependent upon the quality  timing and release dates of all new products  margins may not expand to any significant degree during any period 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the impact these program supplier revenue sharing programs with guaranteed minimums will have on future results of operations in any reporting period 
in the ami division  a portion of the essentials business information service offerings costs represent costs associated with the operation of a call center for our box office essentials services  as well as costs associated with amortizing capitalized internally developed software used to provide the corresponding services and direct costs incurred to obtain  cleanse and process data and maintain our systems 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the fluctuations in cost of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily due to the fluctuations in revenue  as well as the decreases in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 
the decreases in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue were primarily due to the timing and magnitude of units shipped with minimum guarantees  as well as to a larger percentage of our revenue being produced by our ami division 
we achieve higher gross margins on our ami division revenue than on our ppt division revenue 
in addition  as revenues increase in our ami division  cost of sales as a percentage of revenues should decrease as most of our ami division costs are fixed 

table of contents the decrease in cost of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in revenues discussed above  as well as to the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a shift to more ami division revenue in fiscal as compared to ppt division revenue 
also  effective april   we increased the estimated lives of our capitalized software to five years from three years based on a review of our previous usage of such internally developed software 
therefore  costs associated with amortizing this software decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  development  marketing and advertising costs  legal and professional fees  communications costs  depreciation and amortization of tangible fixed assets and software  real and personal property leases  as well as other general corporate expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and increased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in selling and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the continued expansion of our essentials lines of business 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily due to our continued investment in our essentials line of business in fiscal selling and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal included an increase of million in stock based compensation related to the issuance of deferred stock units on april  in addition  selling and administrative expense increased million related to the hiring of additional personnel associated with the expansion of our ami division 
these factors were offset by a million decrease in our bonus accrual in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expense increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to the increase in dollars spent in fiscal combined with decreased revenues over which to spread fixed costs 
asset impairment during fiscal  we recorded a  asset impairment charge related to various components of our essentials lines of business  which had been in development 
management concluded that it was likely the components would not be placed in service in the foreseeable future 
however  this asset impairment charge does not significantly alter management s plans for the expansion of its essentials services 
during fiscal  we recorded an  impairment charge to write off a component of one of our essentials lines of business  which had been in development 
management concluded that it was likely the asset would not be placed in service in the foreseeable future 
interest income interest income was million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower interest rates on investments we had in place during the first half of fiscal interest income was flat in fiscal compared to fiscal as increases due to higher average cash balances were offset by lower interest rates

other income  net other income  net  in fiscal related to the recognition of the cumulative translation adjustment of our rentrak uk subsidiary

table of contents wrote off assets of  accordingly  the net effect of these two amounts of approximately  was recognized as other income  net  in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate was  and  respectively  in fiscal  and our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and other adjustments as noted below 
in fiscal  our tax rate was positively affected by the following factors million for federal and state research and experimentation credits  million for earnings on investments in tax exempt municipal bonds  million for changes in our fin reserve  which includes million of favorable settlements relating to our recently completed federal tax audit offset by an additional reserve of million primarily for tax positions taken in prior fiscal years  and million for income exempt in foreign jurisdictions 
in fiscal  our tax rate was positively affected by million of federal and state research and experimentation credits and negatively affected by a million change associated with our adoption of fin inflation we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal on our business in fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity include our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash expected to be generated from future operations and investment income and our million line of credit 
based on our current financial projections and projected cash needs  we believe that our available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our current operations  the continued current development of our business information services and other cash requirements through at least march  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities increased million to million at march  compared to million at march  this increase resulted primarily from million provided by operating activities  partially offset by million used for the purchase of equipment and capitalized it costs and by million used for the repurchase of common stock 
our current ratio was at march  and at march  accounts receivable  net of allowances  increased million to million at march  compared to million at march   primarily due to increases in receivables due to higher revenues in our ami division  as well as the timing of payments received on units shipped with minimum guaranteed revenues 
in addition  an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable in our ppt division has contributed to the overall increase in accounts receivable 
collection of our ppt division accounts receivable has slowed due to the overall state of the economy 
however  we are able to contractually recover certain bad debts from our program suppliers and we believe we have sufficient reserves to cover any losses which exceed those amounts 
during fiscal  we spent million on property and equipment  including million for the capitalization of internally developed software for our business information service offerings 
we anticipate spending a total of approximately million on property and equipment in fiscal  including approximately million for the capitalization of internally developed software  primarily for our business information service offerings 
the remaining capital expenditures in fiscal will be primarily for computer equipment 
deferred revenue increased million to million at march  compared to million at march   primarily due to a long term agreement with a customer supplier relating to one of our essentials lines of business  in which we will develop reporting tools specifically relating to their unique business requirements 
as of march   we had received payments totaling million and incurred related costs of million  both of which have been deferred 
we will recognize the revenue and related costs when the development project is completed  which is anticipated to be in the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents taxes payable  net of taxes receivable and prepaid taxes  decreased to  at march  compared to million at march  primarily due to the timing of tax payments and the year to date provision for income taxes 
deferred income tax liabilities  net of deferred tax assets  increased to million at march  compared to a net asset of  at march  due primarily to temporary book tax differences related to accelerated expensing of internally developed software expenditures for tax purposes  as well as adoption of a change for tax purposes to cease recognizing short term deferred revenue in advance of book recognition 
deferred rent  current and long term  of million at march  represents amounts received for qualified renovations on our corporate headquarters and free rent for the first three months of the lease terms 
the deferred rent is being amortized against rent expense over the term of the related lease at the rate of approximately  per quarter 
our notes payable  which totaled million at march   were all forgiven during fiscal the notes payable included a million loan from the portland development commission pdc  a million loan from the state of oregon and a  conditional grant from the pdc  all of which were related to our fiscal corporate headquarters renovations 
the million gain related to the note forgiveness was recorded as an offset to leasehold improvements and is being amortized as an offset to depreciation expense over the life of the related leases at the rate of  per quarter through december the balance of the deferral related to the note forgiveness was million at march  in january  our board of directors adopted a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
we repurchased  shares in fiscal at an average price of per share 
through march   a total of  shares had been repurchased under this plan at an average price of per share and  shares remained available for purchase 
this plan does not have an expiration date 
we do not have an established plan for definitive repurchases of shares in any period 
all repurchases of shares are determined by a designated officer 
we currently have a secured revolving line of credit for million  with a maturity of december  interest on the line of credit is libor plus percent 
the credit line is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the line of credit includes certain financial covenants requiring a consolidated pre tax income to be achieved each fiscal quarter of a minimum of  and consolidated after tax income not less than on an annual basis  determined at fiscal year end  a minimum current ratio of  measured quarterly  and a maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio of  measured quarterly 
based upon the financial results reported as of and for the quarter ended march   we determined that we were in compliance with the financial covenants at march  at march   we had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of march  was as follows in thousands payments due by fiscal period contractual obligation total and and and beyond operating leases program supplier guarantees management contracts most of our employment contracts with executive management have a one year term subject to extension

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we follow statement of position sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films  and recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products or services have been delivered  the license period has begun which is referred to as the street date for a product  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 
ppt agreements generally provide for an initial order processing fee and continuing transaction fees based on a percentage of rental revenues earned by the retailers upon renting the units to their customers 
initial order processing fees cover the direct costs of accessing units from program suppliers and handling  packaging and shipping of the units to the retailer 
once the units are shipped  we have no further obligation to provide services to the retailer 
we recognize order processing fees as revenue on the street date and recognize transaction fees when the units are rented to the consumers  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
certain arrangements include guaranteed minimum revenues from our customers 
in these arrangements  we recognize the guaranteed minimum revenue on the street date  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a long term agreement with a customer supplier relating to our essentials line of business  in which we will develop reporting tools specifically relating to their unique business requirements 
we will recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  applying the completed contract method 
we will recognize the revenue and related costs when the development project is completed  which is scheduled to occur during the second quarter of fiscal we recognize other services revenue  including drs revenue in our ppt division  and business information services revenue in our ami division  ratably over the period of service 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable by monitoring past due balances 
if it is determined that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is established based on the amount we expect to recover 
an additional general reserve is provided based on aging of accounts receivable and our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change related to specific customers  overall aging of accounts receivable or collection experience  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could materially change 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  and  respectively  at march  and see also schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts included in item of this annual report on form k 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and nol carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation 
table of contents allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is unlikely  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
as of both march  and  we had a valuation allowance of million recorded against our net operating and capital loss carryforwards in various state and foreign jurisdictions 
net deferred tax assets and liabilities totaled million and  respectively  as of march  and capitalized software we account for capitalized software in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
capitalized software  included in property and equipment  net  consists of costs to purchase and develop internal use software  as well as costs to develop internal software which is used by us to provide various services to clients within our expanding essentials suite of services 
these services provide unique data collection  management  analysis and reporting functions  resulting in business information valuable to our clients 
for example  our box office essentials business line reports domestic and international gross receipt theatrical ticket sales to motion picture studios and movie theatre owners 
our ondemand essentials business line measures and reports anonymous video on demand vod usage data to our clients 
such internal and external costs to develop the internal software used to support these services are capitalized after the technological and business feasibility of the project is determined and the preliminary project stage is completed 
we continue to develop our internal software systems in order to expand our service offerings 
once we begin to utilize such software in our products  these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which is five years 
capitalized software is reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on these reviews  we recorded capitalized software impairment charges of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
no such charges were recorded in fiscal changes in technology could affect our estimate of the useful life of such assets 
capitalized software costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million at march  and  respectively 
stock based compensation sfas no 
r  share based payment  requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  deferred stock units dsus and stock appreciation rights sars based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model for valuing our stock based awards 
as of march   unrecognized stock based compensation related to outstanding  but unvested  options and dsus was million  which will be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period of years 
on october  and november   we granted  performance based nonqualified stock options and  sars to certain key employees 
these awards are subject to vesting provisions based on attaining specific performance goals and will expire on august  to the extent not previously exercised or terminated 
the base price for the sars and the exercise price per option is 
vesting will be accelerated if a change in control occurs before the performance criteria are met 
we will determine whether the performance goals have been met by no later than june  and vested sars will be settled in cash based on the closing sale price of our common stock on august  and paid no later than september  the fair value of the performance based options was estimated to be million using the black scholes valuation model 
however  as of march   no compensation cost has been recognized for these awards as the performance goals are not probable of being attained 
the use of the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 

table of contents compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest 
however  we have not reduced the stock based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures as there is no basis for estimating future forfeitures as most unvested options are held by members of senior management and the board of directors 
we update for forfeitures as they occur and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures are significant  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
accounting for unrecognized tax benefits in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and applies to situations where there is uncertainty as to the timing of the deduction  the amount of the deduction  or the validity of the deduction 
fin requires that we adjust our financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
as of march  and  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million and million  respectively  including penalties and interest of  and million  respectively 
all unrecognized tax benefits at march  would affect the effective tax rate if recognized 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
marketable securities we classify our marketable securities as available for sale securities 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  our marketable securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis  with unrealized gains and losses being excluded from earnings and reflected as a component of other comprehensive income 
dividend and interest income is recognized when earned 
realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 
new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements
