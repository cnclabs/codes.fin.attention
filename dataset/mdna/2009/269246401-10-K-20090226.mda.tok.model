item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
glossary of terms in analyzing and discussing our business  we utilize certain metrics  ratios and other terms that are defined in the glossary of terms  which is located at the end of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview strategy our strategy is to profitably grow our retail customer franchise and mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet 
we plan to grow our retail customer franchise by offering online brokerage and related products and services  including investor focused banking and asset gathering products and services 
we believe we can accomplish this growth by appealing to retail investors  especially customers of traditional brokerages  who are attracted to our low cost  easy to use and innovative capabilities 
our plan to mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet contains three core goals reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio  reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses 
we believe that the successful completion of this plan will significantly improve our financial strength 
we are also focused on simplifying and streamlining the business by exiting and or restructuring certain non core operations 
we believe these changes will better align our business with the retail investor 
key factors affecting financial performance our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control  including customer demand for financial products and services  the weakness or strength of the residential real estate and credit markets  the performance  volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets  customer perception of the financial strength of our franchise  market demand and liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans and securities  and market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market  including securities sold and agreements to repurchase 
in addition to the items noted above  our success in the future will depend upon  among other things continuing our success in the acquisition  growth and retention of customers  deepening customer acceptance of our products and services  our ability to assess and manage credit risk  our ability to assess and manage interest rate risk  and disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency

all discussions  unless otherwise noted  are based on metrics from continuing operations 
for the year ended december   net new customer assets were billion excluding the sale of retirement advisors of america raa 
customer activity metrics changes in retail customer assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer 
an increase in retail customer assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding 
changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities  which declined substantially in net new customer assets are total inflows to all new and existing customer accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing customer accounts and are a general indicator of the use of our products and services by existing and new customers 
customer cash and deposits are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income 
darts are the predominant driver of commission revenue from our retail customers 
average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix  product mix and or product pricing 
as a result  this metric is impacted by both the mix between our retail domestic and international businesses and the mix between active traders  mass affluent and main street customers

table of contents allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is typically equal to the expected charge offs in our loan portfolio over the next twelve months 
allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans is a general indicator of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
changes in this ratio are also driven by changes in the mix of our loan portfolio 
nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable is an indicator of the performance of our total loan portfolio 
enterprise net interest spread is a broad indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income 
enterprise interest earning assets  in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread  are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income

significant events in citadel investment of billion including sale of asset backed securities portfolio the operating environment during  particularly during the second half of the year  was extremely challenging as our exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance and led to a disruption in our customer base 
as a result  we believe it was necessary to obtain a significant infusion of cash  which would in turn stabilize our balance sheet and our customer base 
on november   we entered into an agreement to receive a billion cash infusion from citadel 
in consideration for the cash infusion  citadel received three primary items substantially all of our asset backed securities portfolio  million shares of common stock in the company and approximately billion in springing lien notes

the continued deterioration in the residential real estate and credit markets  as well as the nearly unprecedented turmoil in the global financial markets  had a significant impact on our financial performance during the losses in our institutional segment caused by this deterioration more than offset the strong underlying performance of our retail segment  resulting in a net loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  our retail customer base showed positive growth trends during the year  including the addition of approximately  net new accounts and net inflows of customer assets of approximately billion 
we believe these are indications that our retail segment has not only stabilized  but has returned to modest growth 

table of contents balance sheet highlights dollars in billions december  variance vs 
total assets total enterprise interest earning assets loans  net and margin receivables as a percentage of enterprise interest earning assets retail deposits and customer payables as a percentage of enterprise interest bearing liabilities the decrease in total assets was attributable primarily to a decrease of billion in loans  net and a decrease of billion in margin receivables 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash and equivalents and cash and investments required to be segregated under federal or other regulations of billion 
for the foreseeable future  we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio 
during this period  we plan to maintain excess regulatory capital at e trade bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our loan portfolios 
during the year ended december   we increased our excess risk based capital at e trade bank by to million compared to prior year 
in connection with this strategy and the citadel investment  we have updated our secondary market purchase policies to prohibit the acquisition of asset backed securities  collateralized debt obligations cdo and certain other instruments with a high level of credit risk through january  earnings overview compared to we had a net loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  the loss for the year ended december  was due principally to an increase in our provision for loan losses of million to billion 
in addition  we incurred losses of million  net of hedges  on our preferred stock in federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac during the period ended december  the losses in our institutional segment  which included both of these items  more than offset our retail segment income  which was million for the year ended december  in the second quarter of  we made the decision to sell our canadian brokerage business and we decided to close our direct retail lending business 
as a result  the financial results for both the canadian brokerage business and the direct retail lending business have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented

we report corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense 
we believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items 
our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the company and is a broad indicator of the performance in our banking and balance sheet management businesses 
our corporate debt  which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense  has been issued primarily in connection with the citadel investment and past acquisitions  such as harrisdirect and brownco 
similarly  we report gain loss on sales of investments  net separately from gain loss on loans and securities  net

average loans  net decreased to billion for the year ended december  compared to as a result of our focus on growing the one to four family loan portfolio in the first and second quarters of beginning in the second half of  we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet 
for the foreseeable future  we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio 
average enterprise interest bearing liabilities decreased to billion for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in repurchase agreements and other borrowings  fhlb advances and customer payables 
average repurchase agreements and other borrowings decreased to billion for the year ended december  compared to average fhlb advances decreased to billion for the year ended december  compared to repurchase agreements and other borrowings are the primary wholesale funding sources for our loans  net and available for sale securities portfolios 
the decreases in these balances were the result of paying down these liabilities as we decreased the size of our balance sheet during average customer payables decreased to billion for the year ended december  compared to  which was related primarily to the sale of our canadian brokerage business during the third quarter of enterprise net interest spread decreased by basis points to for the year ended december  compared to this decrease was driven in part by an atypical spread among two key benchmark interest rates federal funds and the london interbank offered rate libor 
the majority of our interest earning assets and liabilities are linked  either directly or indirectly  to these benchmark interest rates 
we believe this spread will return to more normalized levels in future periods 
in addition  we plan to reduce the rates paid on our complete savings account to be more consistent with current market rates 
we believe the combined impact of these two items will result in a modest increase to our net interest spread in future periods

commission revenue from our retail segment  which is the sole source of commission revenue in future periods  remained stable for the year ended december  declining by only compared to the primary factors that affect our retail commission revenue are darts and average commission per trade  which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses 
each business has a different pricing structure  unique to its customer base and local market practices  and as a result  a change in the relative number of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade 
each business also has different trade types eg equities  options  fixed income  exchange traded funds  contract for difference and mutual funds that can have different commission rates 
as a result  changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade

in addition  option related darts as a percentage of our total us darts represented and of us trading volume for the periods ending december  and  respectively 
average commission per trade decreased to for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was primarily a function of the product and customer mix 
the overall poor performance of the equity markets for the year ended december  disproportionately impacted higher commission products  such as corporate services transactions and mutual funds 
main street investors  who generally have a higher commission per trade  traded less during the period compared to active traders and mass affluent customers  who generally have a lower commission per trade 
customer appreciation  win back and other promotional campaigns also contributed to the decrease in average commission per trade 
fees and service charges fees and service charges decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to this decrease was primarily due to a lower order flow revenue  advisory management fees and cdo 
table of contents management fees 
the decrease in advisory management fees was primarily due to our sale of raa 
the decrease in cdo management fees was due to the sale of our collateral management agreements during the first quarter of principal transactions principal transactions decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower institutional trading volumes 
our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes  the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker  the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities

table of contents provision for loan losses provision for loan losses increased million to billion for the year ended december  compared to the increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio  which began in the second half of during the year ended december   we also experienced deterioration in the performance of our one to four family loan portfolio 
we believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors  including home price depreciation in virtually all key markets  growing inventories of unsold homes  rising foreclosure rates  sustained contraction in the availability of credit  and a severe downturn in the economy 
while we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods  we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in operating expense the components of operating expense and the year over year variances are as follows dollars in thousands variance year ended december  vs

operating expense decreased to billion for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in expense excluding interest was driven primarily by decreases in compensation and benefits  clearing and servicing  impairment of goodwill and other expense 
these decreases were offset slightly by an increase in advertising and market development expense 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease resulted primarily from lower salary expense due to a reduction in our employee base and decreased variable compensation during the year ended december  when compared to clearing and servicing clearing and servicing expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to this decrease is related primarily to the exit of our institutional brokerage operations  which resulted in lower clearing expenses 

table of contents advertising and market development advertising and market development expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to this planned increase was aimed at restoring customer confidence as well as expanded efforts to promote our products and services to retail investors

total other income expense for the year ended december  consisted primarily of corporate interest expense resulting from our corporate debt  which included the springing lien notes  senior notes and mandatory convertible notes 
corporate interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to the interest expense on the springing lien notes that were issued in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of during  our wholly owned subsidiary  e trade mauritius  sold its equity shares in investsmart for proceeds of approximately million  which 
table of contents resulted in a gain on sale of million recorded in equity in income of investments and venture funds

the gain on early extinguishment of debt is primarily due to a gain of million recognized on the exchange of our senior notes for shares of our common stock for the year ended december  the gain of million is offset by a loss of million related to the early extinguishment of fhlb advances and a loss of million on the prepayment of debt related to the sale of the corporate aircraft

during the year ended december  we did not provide for a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we did conclude that a valuation allowance was required  the resulting loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and our regulatory capital position at e trade bank 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of billion 
we did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets as of december  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized 
our evaluation focused on identifying significant  objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future 
we 
table of contents reviewed the estimated future taxable income for our retail and institutional segments separately and determined that our net operating losses in and were due solely to the credit losses in our institutional segment 
we believe these losses were caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets which significantly impacted our asset backed securities and home equity loan portfolios in and continued to generate credit losses in we estimate that these credit losses will continue in future periods  however  we ceased the business activities which we believe are the root cause of these losses 
therefore  while we do expect credit losses to continue in future periods  we do expect these amounts to decline when compared to our credit losses in and our retail segment generated substantial book taxable income for each of the last six years and we estimate that it will continue to generate taxable income in future periods at a level sufficient enough to generate taxable income for the company as a whole 
we consider this to be significant  objective evidence that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book taxable loss position as of the three year period ended december   which is considered significant  objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of our deferred tax assets in the future 
however  we believe we are able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position 
the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has created significant volatility in our results of operations 
this volatility is isolated almost entirely to our institutional segment 
our forecasts for this segment include assumptions regarding our estimate of future expected credit losses  which we believe to be the most variable component of our forecasts of future taxable income 
we believe this variability could create a book loss in our overall results for an individual reporting period while not significantly impacting our overall estimate of taxable income over the period in which we expect to realize our deferred tax assets 
conversely  we believe our retail segment will continue to produce a stable stream of income which we believe we can reliably estimate in both individual reporting periods as well as over the period in which we estimate we will realize our deferred tax assets 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts 
this process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain 
if future events differ significantly from our current forecasts  a valuation allowance may need to be established  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and our regulatory capital position at e trade bank 
in addition  a significant portion of the net deferred tax asset relates to a billion federal tax loss carryforward  the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the ownership of the company 
we will continue to monitor and update our assumptions and forecasts of future taxable income and assess the need for a valuation allowance 

table of contents income from discontinued operations  net of tax during the year ended december   we sold our canadian brokerage business to scotiabank 
the sale resulted in proceeds of approximately million  including million in repatriation of capital prior to the close and a pre tax gain of million 
we also exited our direct retail lending business  which was our last remaining loan origination channel we exited our wholesale mortgage lending channel in 
therefore  the results of operations of our canadian brokerage business  including the gain on sale  and the entire direct retail lending business are reported as discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income loss for all periods presented

the benefit of excess tax basis over book basis is related to our canadian brokerage business  which resulted from the difference between the tax and financial reporting bases of the business

we believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors  including home price depreciation in virtually all key markets  growing inventories of unsold homes  rising foreclosure rates  sustained contraction in the availability of credit  and a severe downturn in the economy 
while we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods  we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in total institutional segment expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to this decrease was due primarily to the goodwill impairment recorded for the year ended december  associated with our balance sheet management business

the decrease in total assets was attributable primarily to a decrease of billion in loans  net and a decrease of billion in margin receivables for the period ended december  compared to these decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash of billion 
the decrease in loans  net is due to our strategy of reducing balance sheet risk and halting our previous focus on growing the balance sheet 
for the foreseeable future  we plan to allow our home equity loans to pay down resulting in an overall decline in the balance of the loan portfolio 
during this period  we plan to maintain excess regulatory capital at e trade bank as we focus on strengthening our capital position 
we believe the decrease in our margin receivables is due to customers deleveraging and reducing their risk exposure due to the volatility in the financial markets and is not due to a specific issue with the terms or competitiveness of our margin product

the cds provides protection for losses in excess of million  but not to exceed approximately million 
in addition  our regulatory risk weighted assets were reduced as a result of this transaction because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to an unaffiliated third party 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in losses on the portion of the loans covered under the cds

the decrease in other borrowings of billion for the period ended december  was due primarily to a decrease in fhlb advances 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase coupled with fhlb advances are the primary wholesale funding sources of the bank 
as a result  we expect these balances to fluctuate over time as our deposits and our interest earning assets fluctuate 
corporate debt corporate debt is summarized as follows dollars in thousands variance december  vs 
amount senior notes springing lien notes mandatory convertible notes total corporate debt percentage not meaningful 
corporate debt decreased to billion at december  compared to billion at december   primarily due to the retirement of the million in mandatory convertible notes during the fourth quarter of and a decline in senior notes of million in principal related to debt for equity exchanges 
offsetting these decreases was an additional million of springing lien notes issued to citadel in the first quarter of and the issuance of million of springing lien notes in satisfaction of the november interest payment on these notes 
liquidity and capital resources we have established liquidity and capital policies 
the objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle 
these policies are especially important during periods of stress in the financial markets  which have been ongoing since the fourth quarter of and will likely continue for the foreseeable future 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a disruption in our customer base  which caused a significant decline in customer deposits 
we believe this disruption was due to uncertainty in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment 
deposits are the primary source of liquidity for e trade bank  so this sudden and rapid decline created a substantial amount of liquidity risk 
we followed our existing liquidity policies and 
table of contents contingency plans and successfully met our liquidity needs during this extraordinary period 
we believe that our ability to meet liquidity needs during this time validates the effectiveness of the liquidity policies and contingency plans 
while the liquidity risk associated with our customer deposits remains at historically high levels  we believe the current level of risk is substantially lower than it was during the fourth quarter of capital is generated primarily through our business operations and our capital market activities 
during the second half of  our institutional segment incurred a significant amount of losses as a result of its exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets 
consequently  this segment required a significant capital infusion during the fourth quarter of the company raised billion in cash from citadel  the majority of which was used to provide capital to the institutional segment 
while this segment continues to have exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets  our retail segment remains profitable and continues to generate capital through retained earnings 
we maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimums at our regulated subsidiaries  the most significant of which is e trade bank 
as of december   we held million of risk based capital at e trade bank in excess of the regulatory minimum level required to be considered well capitalized 
we raised additional capital in by issuing shares of common stock in exchange for existing corporate debt  primarily our senior notes  commonly referred to as a exchanges 
we completed several a exchanges in the first half of  which resulted in a retirement of million of existing corporate debt 
we did not complete any of these transactions during the second half of as the relative prices of our common stock and corporate debt made it unattractive to do so 
in addition  we raised approximately million in cash through non core asset sales  including the sale of our canadian brokerage business and our equity shares in investsmart 
we believe the combination of the capital generated in the transactions detailed above  the excess capital held at e trade bank and the capital that continues to be generated in our retail segment will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
during the fourth quarter of  we applied to the us treasury for funding under the tarp capital purchase program 
our application remains under active consideration and we cannot predict when a final decision will be reached 
we estimate this program could provide up to approximately million in new preferred equity  at rates substantially discounted to current market rates 
if our application is approved  it would likely be conditional upon additional capital raising activities by us  including possible transactions with existing security holders 
our ability to issue preferred equity under the tarp program would be dependent upon receiving approval from certain of our bond holders and possibly our shareholders 
while we do not believe we need this capital to fund our operations  it does have the potential to significantly improve the capital position of both e trade bank and the parent company  which would enhance our ability to maintain the balance sheet at its current level 
the equity shares of investsmart were sold by our wholly owned subsidiary  e trade mauritius 

table of contents corporate cash corporate cash is the primary source of liquidity at the parent company and is available to invest in our regulated subsidiaries

the cash held in our regulated subsidiaries serves as a source of liquidity for those subsidiaries and is not a primary source of capital for the parent company 
cash and equivalents held in the reserve fund at december   we held cash in the reserve funds primary fund the fund of million  which is included as a receivable in other assets line item on the balance sheet 
on september   the fund reported that its shares had fallen below the standard of per share  which is commonly referred to as breaking the buck

we received million and million  respectively  in connection with these distributions 
on december   the reserve indicated that they are required to distribute the remaining assets of the fund ratably among the holders of outstanding shares  irrespective of whether the investor made a redemption request before or after the fund breaking the buck 
the statement indicated  assuming a pro rata distribution  the net asset value per share would be 
as a result of that statement  we no longer believe it is probable that we will receive the full amount of our remaining position in the fund  therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to this investment 
the impairment charge of million related to our corporate cash was included in gain loss on sales of investments  net line item 
the impairment charge of million related to our banking and brokerage subsidiaries is included in gain loss on loans and securities  net line item 
the remaining amount of million  net of the million impairment charge  that we invested in the fund is included as a receivable in the other assets line item 
on february   the reserve announced that it had adopted a plan of liquidation for the orderly liquidation of the assets of the fund 
under the terms of the plan  which is subject to the supervision of the sec  the reserve will continue to make interim distributions up to per share 
the reserve indicated in this announcement that they were taking this approach in order to provide liquidity to investors without prejudicing the legal rights and remedies of any shareholder s claims 
this announcement does not change our belief that we will receive the full amount of our remaining position upon the ultimate distribution of the fund  however  we cannot state with certainty that we will not ultimately incur additional loss on our remaining position 
in addition  we believe it will take a significant amount of time to eventually receive these funds 
liquidity available from subsidiaries liquidity available to the company from its subsidiaries  other than converging arrows  inc converging arrows and e trade mauritius  a wholly owned subsidiary of converging arrows  is limited by regulatory requirements 
any loans by e trade bank to the parent company and its other non bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative  arm s length  collateralization and other requirements 
at december   e trade bank had approximately million of risk based capital above the well capitalized level 
in the current credit environment  we plan to keep this significant amount of excess risk based capital at e trade bank in order to enhance our ability to absorb credit losses while still maintaining well capitalized status 
however  events beyond management s control  such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets  could adversely affect future earnings and e trade bank s ability to meet its future capital requirements 
the company s broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements determined by their respective regulators 
at december  and  all of our brokerage subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements 
the company s broker dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of million at december  while we cannot assure that we would obtain regulatory approval to withdraw any of this excess net capital  million is available for dividend while still maintaining a capital level above regulatory early warning guidelines 
the impairment charge was calculated based on the company s investment balance as of september  the day the fund broke the buck  which totaled million 
the excess net capital of the broker dealer subsidiaries included million of excess net capital at e trade clearing  which is a subsidiary of e trade bank and is also included in the excess risk based capital of e trade bank 

table of contents other sources of liquidity we also maintain million in uncommitted financing to meet margin lending needs 
at december   there were no outstanding balances  and the full million was available 
we rely on borrowed funds  such as fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  to provide liquidity for the bank 
our ability to borrow these funds is dependent upon the continued availability of funding in the wholesale borrowings market 
at december   the bank had approximately billion in additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb 
we have the option to make interest payments on our springing lien notes in the form of either cash or additional springing lien notes through may during the second quarter of  we elected to make our first interest payment of approximately million in cash 
during the fourth quarter of  we elected to make our second interest payment of million in the form of additional springing lien notes 
we expect to make our next three interest payments  which equates to all interest payments on the springing lien notes through may in the form of additional springing lien notes 
the november payment is the first interest payment we are required to pay in cash
