table of contents income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 
in addition  the company adopted fin as of january  fin requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions  as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances  but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money

pension and other retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  are evaluated and updated annually 
the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be for its waters retirement plan  which is the majority of the company s benefit obligation and expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moody s aa interest rate as of december  that best matched the timing of the plan s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
once the interest rates were determined  the plan s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date 
at december   the company determined this rate to be for the waters retirement plan  which is the majority of the company s benefit obligation and expense 
retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the company s defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

stock based compensation the company adopted sfas no 
r on january  this standard requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values 
the company has used the black scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company s results of operations could be materially impacted 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r  the compensation expense that the company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period

the company 
table of contents attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments  for purposes other than trading  in accordance with the company s overall risk management guidelines 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances  forecasted transactions and cash flow  and net assets denominated in euro  japanese yen and british pound 
the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances 
in addition  the company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates

if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings  ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
the company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks 
the company s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency and interest rate exposures 
the company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value  cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions 
the company also assesses and documents  both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items 
cash flow hedges the company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding us dollar floating rate debt 
in august  the company entered into two floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps  each with a notional amount of million and maturity dates of april and october  to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt

other the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts  principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter company balances 
principal hedged currencies primarily include the euro  japanese yen  british pound and singapore dollar
