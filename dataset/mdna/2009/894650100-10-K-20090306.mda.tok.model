executive summary general tredegar is a manufacturer of plastic films and aluminum extrusions 
descriptions of our businesses are provided on pages income from continuing operations was million cents per diluted share in compared with million cents per diluted share in gains on the sale of assets  investment write downs or write ups and other items and losses related to plant shutdowns  assets impairments and restructurings are described in results of operations beginning on page the business segment review begins on page film products in film products  net sales were million in  down versus million in operating profit from ongoing operations was million in  down compared with million in volume decreased to million pounds in from million pounds in the volume decline was primarily due to competitive pressures in most product segments  most notably the personal care and surface protection markets 
net sales declined compared to last year due to lower volume  partially offset by higher selling prices from the pass through of increased resin costs 
a significant portion of the substantially lower resin costs realized in the fourth quarter of will not be passed through to customers via lower selling prices until the first quarter of operating profit from ongoing operations in film products decreased in versus due primarily to lower volume  partially offset by cost reduction efforts and the benefit from appreciation of the us dollar value of currencies for operations outside of the us benefit from currency rate changes was approximately million 
film products has index based pass through raw material cost agreements for the majority of its business 
however  under certain agreements  changes in resin prices are not passed through for an average period of days 
the estimated unfavorable impact of the lag in the pass through of changes in average resin costs and year end adjustments for inventories accounted for under the last in first out method lifo was  and million for and  respectively 
volume and operating profits in films are expected to continue to be adversely impacted by competitive pressures and the global economic downturn 
more than ever  we are focused on reducing costs and managing the business under significantly greater economic uncertainty 
capital expenditures in film products were million in  down from million in  and are projected to be approximately million in depreciation expense was million in  up from million in  and is projected to be approximately million in aluminum extrusions net sales from continuing operations in aluminum extrusions were million in  down from million in operating profit from ongoing us operations decreased to million in  down from million in volume from continuing operations was million pounds in  down from million pounds in the decrease in net sales was mainly due to lower volume 
shipments declined in most markets 
shipments in non residential construction  which comprised of total volume in  declined by approximately in compared with operating profit from ongoing us operations declined in compared with last year mainly due to lower volume 
overall backlog for continuing operations in aluminum extrusions at december  was down by approximately compared with december  we continue to be very focused on reducing costs in light of anticipated further declines in volume based on current market conditions 
capital expenditures for continuing operations in aluminum extrusions were million in  a million increase from million in  and are projected to be approximately million in in january  we announced plans to spend approximately million over the following months to expand the capacity at our plant in carthage  tennessee 
this project  which accounted for million of capital expenditures in  will increase our capabilities in the non residential construction sector 
depreciation expense for continuing operations was million in  a decrease of from million in  and is projected to be million in on february   we sold our aluminum extrusions business in canada for approximately million to an affiliate of hig capital 
we realized cash income tax benefits in from the sale of approximately million 
all historical results for this business have been reflected as discontinued operations 
other developments net pension income from continuing operations was million in  a favorable change of million cents per share after taxes from amounts recognized in most of the favorable changes relate to a pension plan that is reflected in corporate expenses  net in the operating profit by segment table presented on page we contributed approximately  to our pension plans for continuing operations in at december   the fair value of the assets of our pension plans was estimated at million  down from million at december  the significant decline was mainly due to the drop in global stock prices and benefit payments to retirees of approximately million in the projected benefit obligation at december  is approximately million at a discount rate of 
the minimum required contribution to our pension plans in is estimated at million  and net pension income in is estimated at million 
interest expense was million in  a  decline versus as higher average debt levels during the year were offset by lower average interest 
the effective tax rate used to compute income taxes from continuing operations was in compared with in the decrease in the effective tax rate for continuing operations for versus  which had a favorable impact of cents per share  was due to numerous factors as shown in the effective income tax rate reconciliation provided in note on page on april   we invested million in harbinger capital partners special situations fund  lp harbinger  a fund that seeks to achieve superior absolute returns by participating primarily in medium to long term investments involving distressed high yield debt securities  special situation equities and private loans and notes 
the fund is a highly speculative investment and subject to limitations on withdrawal 
there is no secondary market for interests in the fund 
our investment in harbinger  which represents less than of harbinger s total partnership capital  is accounted for under the cost method 
at december   harbinger reported our capital account value at million versus the carrying value of million included in other assets and deferred charges in our consolidated balance sheet 
see discussion of investment accounted for under the fair value method on page during and  we invested million and million  respectively  in real estate 
at december  and  the carrying value of investments in this real estate equaled the amounts invested included in other assets and deferred charges in our consolidated balance sheet 
in we repurchased million shares of our stock under a standing authorization from our board of directors at an average price of per share 
due to strong cash flows from operations and proceeds received from the sales of the aluminum extrusions business in canada  our net debt total debt of million less cash and cash equivalents of million of million at december  improved to net cash cash and cash equivalents of million in excess of total debt of million of million at december  net debt or cash is not intended to represent debt or cash as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  but is utilized by management in evaluating financial leverage and equity valuation and we believe that investors also may find net debt or cash helpful for the same purposes 
consolidated net capitalization and other credit measures are provided in the financial condition section beginning on page critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgments that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
impairment and useful lives of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill we regularly assess our long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
any necessary impairment charges are recorded when we do not believe the carrying value of the long lived asset will be recoverable 
we also reassess the useful lives of our long lived assets based on changes in our business and technologies 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis december st of each year 
our reporting units include film products and aluminum extrusions  each of which may have separately identifiable operating net assets operating assets including goodwill and intangible assets net of operating liabilities 
as of december and december   the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of their respective net assets 
we estimate the fair value using discounted cash flow analysis and comparative enterprise value to ebitda multiples 
the estimated fair value of film products exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by a wide margin 
in aluminum extrusions  the excess of its fair value over carrying value of related net assets was approximately at december  estimated fair values and carrying values change as business conditions change  and the relatively low margin by which the estimated fair value of aluminum extrusions exceeded its carrying value results in a reasonably possible chance that a goodwill impairment under us generally accepted accounting principles will be triggered in the future 
as of december   we estimate that if the estimated fair value of aluminum extrusions were only below the carrying value of its net assets  that the amount of the goodwill impairment under us generally accepted accounting principles would have been an anomalous write off of the entire amount of million also million after taxes since there would be no income tax benefits related to the write off 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if impairment tests are met or the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
based upon assessments performed  we recorded asset impairment losses for continuing operations related to long lived identifiable assets of million in   in and million in for asset impairments relating to discontinued operations  see note to the notes to financial statements 
investment accounted for under the fair value method on august   we invested million in a privately held drug delivery that is developing and commercializing state of the art drug delivery systems designed to improve patient compliance and outcomes 
on december   we invested an additional million as part of a new round of equity financing completed by the investee 
this investment is accounted for under the fair value method 
we elected the fair value option over the equity method of accounting since our investment objectives are similar to those of venture capitalists  which typically do not have controlling financial interests venture capital funds use the fair value method to account for their investment portfolios 
at december   our ownership interest was approximately on a fully diluted basis 
in connection with the new round of equity financing in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an unrealized gain of million for the write up of this investment based upon the implied valuation of our ownership interest 
at december  and  the fair value of our investment the carrying value included in other assets and deferred charges in our consolidated balance sheet was million and million  respectively 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  requires disclosure of the level within the fair value hierarchy in which fair value measurements in their entirety fall  segregating fair value measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  significant other observable inputs level  and significant unobservable inputs level 
on the dates of our investments august  and december   we believe that the amount we paid for our ownership interest and liquidation preferences was based on level inputs  including investments by other investors 
subsequent to the last round of financing  and until the next round of financing  we believe fair value estimates drop to level inputs since there is no secondary market for our ownership interest 
in addition  the company currently has no product sales 
accordingly  after the latest financing and until the next round of financing or other significant financial transaction  value estimates will primarily be based on assumptions relating to meeting product development and commercialization milestones  cash flow projections projections of sales  costs  expenses  capital expenditures and working capital investment and discounting of these factors for the high degree of risk 
as a result  an increase in our estimate of the fair value of our ownership interest is unlikely unless a significant new round of financing  merger or initial public offering indicates a higher value 
however  if the company does not meet its development and commercialization milestones and there are indications that the amount or timing of its projected cash flows or related risks are unfavorable versus plans as of december   or another new round of financing or other significant financial transaction indicates a lower value  then our estimate of the fair value of our ownership interest in the company is likely to decline 
pension benefits we have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in our continuing operations that have significant net pension income developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension income recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
the discount rate is the single rate that  when applied to expected benefit payments  provides a present value equal to the present value of expected benefit payments determined by using the aa rated bond yield curve 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
our weighted average discount rate for continuing operations was at the end of  at the end of and at the end of  with changes between periods due to changes in market interest rates 
the compensation increase assumption affects the estimate of future payments  and was at the end of and not applicable in 
based on plan changes announced in  pay for active participants of the plan was frozen as of december  a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
the value of our plan assets relating to continuing operations decreased million  or  in primarily due to the drop in global stock prices 
between and  the value of our plan assets relating to continuing operations increased due to improved general market conditions after declining from to our expected long term return on plan assets relating to continuing operations  which is primarily based on estimated market and economic conditions as well as asset mix  was from to  in and in and prior years 
our expected long term return on plan assets was lowered to for fiscal year see page for more information on expected long term return on plan assets and asset mix 
see the executive summary beginning on page for further discussion regarding the financial impact of our pension plans 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we review our judgments regarding uncertain tax positions and the likelihood that the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
as circumstances change  we reflect in earnings any adjustments to unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
for financial reporting purposes  we had unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
included in the and amounts were million and million  respectively  for tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which the timing of deductibility is uncertain 
because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting  other than interest  penalties and deductions not related to timing  a longer deductibility period would not affect the total income tax expense or the annual effective tax rate shown for financial reporting purposes  but would accelerate payments to the taxing authority 
tax payments resulting from the successful challenge by the taxing authority for accelerated deductions taken by us would possibly result in the payment of interest and penalties 
accordingly  we also accrue for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
the balance of accrued interest and penalties on deductions taken relating to uncertain tax positions was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  and  respectively  net of corresponding federal and state income tax benefits 
accruals for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are reflected in income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
we anticipate that by december   we will settle several disputed issues raised by the internal revenue service the irs during its examination of our us income tax returns for  the most significant of which regards the recognition of our captive insurance subsidiary as an insurance company for us income tax purposes 
it is reasonably possible that a settlement with the irs for the disputed issues would cost us million  which would be applied against the balance of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties 
tredegar and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in us  state and foreign jurisdictions 
tredegar is no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before with few exceptions  tredegar and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to state or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before as of december  and  we had valuation allowances relating to deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively

further  any indemnification payments may be limited or barred by a monetary cap  a time limitation  or a deductible or basket 
for these reasons  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of the potential future liability under the indemnity provisions of these agreements 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is probable 
we disclose contingent liabilities if the probability of loss is reasonably possible and significant

changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices as well as natural gas prices natural gas is the principal energy source used to operate our casting furnaces 
there is no assurance of our ability to pass through higher raw material and energy costs to our customers 
see the executive summary beginning on page and the business segment review beginning on page for discussion regarding the impact of the lag in the pass through of resin price changes 
the volatility of average quarterly prices of low density polyethylene resin in the us a primary raw material for film products is shown in the chart below 
line graph source quarterly averages computed by tredegar using monthly data provided by chemical data inc cdi 
in january  cdi reflected a cents per pound non market adjustment based on their estimate of the growth of discounts over the to period 
the th quarter average rate of cents per pound is shown on a pro forma basis as if the non market adjustment was made in october resin prices in europe  asia and south america have exhibited similar trends 
the price of resin is driven by several factors including supply and demand and the price of oil  ethylene and natural gas 
to address fluctuating resin prices  film products has index based pass through raw material cost agreements for the majority of its business 
however  under certain agreements  changes in resin prices are not passed through for an average period of days see the executive summary on page and the business segment review on page for more information 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility see the chart below under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire or hedge aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries

in aluminum extrusions  we hedge from time to time a portion of our exposure to natural gas price volatility by entering into fixed price forward purchase contracts with our natural gas suppliers 
we estimate that  in an unhedged situation  every per mmbtu per month change in the market price of natural gas has a  impact on the continuing monthly operating profit for our us operations in aluminum extrusions 
in september  we announced an energy surcharge for our aluminum extrusions business in the us to be applied when the previous quarter s nymex natural gas average settlement price is in excess of per mmbtu
