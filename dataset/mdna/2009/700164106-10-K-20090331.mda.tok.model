item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and recent developments the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans  investment securities  mortgage backed securities and other interest earning assets primarily cash and cash equivalents  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of savings accounts  checking accounts  time deposits and fhlb advances 
the company s results of operations also are affected by its provisions for loan losses  non interest income and non interest expense 
non interest income currently consists primarily of service charge income  earnings on bank owned life insurance  gains and losses on the sale of securities and miscellaneous other income 
non interest expense currently consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits  real estate or investment securities impairment charges  occupancy  data processing  professional fees  and other operating expenses 
the company s results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
throughout and continuing into  there have been severe disruptions in the mortgage  credit and housing markets  both locally and nationally 
these disruptions have had a significant negative impact on real estate and related industries  which has led to decreases in commercial and residential real estate sales  construction and property values 
while these disruptions have not yet had a significant negative impact on the bank s loan portfolio  we have experienced a reduction in demand for new loans  with a consequential reduction in the size of our loan portfolio  and an increase in the amount of nonperforming loans compared to year end at december   nonperforming loans represented of gross loans  compared to at december  also  the decreased demand for new residential mortgage loans and the increase in nonperforming loans has resulted in a contraction of our net interest rate spread and net interest margin and the need to increase the provision for loan losses compared to should the housing market and economic conditions in the chicago area stagnate or continue to deteriorate  it could have a material negative effect on the company s business and results of operation

table of contents average statement of financial condition the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average statement of financial condition and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years ended december    and the yields and costs are derived by dividing interest income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years shown 
average balances are derived from average month end balances 
management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented 
average balances of loans receivable include loans on which the bank has discontinued accruing interest 
loan yields include fees which are considered adjustments to yields

net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 

table of contents rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the years indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

during  loans decreased million to million from million in primarily due to a lower volume of loan originations and larger than anticipated loan repayments during these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in premises and equipment  the result of the bank s new branch location on th street in chicago  illinois which opened in june  total liabilities at december  were million compared to million at december  deposits remained stable with an increase of  to million at december  from million at december  advances from the federal home loan bank increased million to million at december  from million at december  
table of contents stockholders equity at december  decreased million to million compared to million at december  book value at december  was per share 
the decrease in stockholders equity from december  was primarily attributable to the repurchase of  shares at an average price of or  dividends paid of  a net loss of million  and a change in the fair value of securities available for sale  net of tax  of  comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general net loss was million for the year ended december   compared to a  net loss for the same period in the change is primarily due to an increase in noninterest expense of million  which was the result of a million loss on security impairment and a million impairment on the carrying value of other real estate owned properties

provision for loan losses management establishes provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  at a level management believes is appropriate to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio 
in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical loss experience  the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  peer group information  and prevailing economic conditions 
management increased the factor relating to economic conditions due to the weakening economy throughout the year and the increased unemployment level in the latter half of this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision  as more information becomes available or as future events change 
the provision for loan losses was  and  in and  respectively 

table of contents management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance for loan losses as of december  is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable 
noninterest income noninterest income in was  compared to  in the change was primarily due to a  gain on the sales of securities and a gain on the sale of real estate owned of  realized in with no similar gains occurring in the company does not expect significant gains on the sales of securities or sales of real estate owned in  as significant securities sales are not a planned strategy of the company  and real estate owned is carried at the estimated market value as of december  noninterest expense noninterest expense in was million  an increase of million from the change was primarily due to a loss on security impairment of million and a writedown on the carrying value of other real estate owned of million during the company recognized a million other than temporary impairment loss on its mutual fund investment and a  other than temporary impairment loss on its equity securities portfolio in management believed it could no longer forecast a recovery within a reasonable holding period for these investments  and according to accounting literature in fasb staff position  the losses were recognized through earnings 
advertising expense increased  for the year ended december  from the same period in due to the opening of the branch location on th street in chicago 
professional fees were  for the year ended compared to  in this increase was due to additional legal and accounting fees related to the company s supervisory agreement with the ots and the replacement of the company s chief financial officer 
the mutual fund investment and equity securities portfolio is carried at market value as of december  subsequent to december   the market value of the investments has continued to deteriorate 
if the market value declines are determined to be other than temporary  additional noninterest expense will be recognized in future periods 
similarly  real estate owned is carried at the estimated market value as of december  if the estimated value of real estate continues to decline  additional noninterest expense will be recognized in future periods 
management monitors the market value of the mutual fund investment by periodically reviewing the published net asset value of the mutual fund 
management monitors the estimated value of the company s real estate owned by periodically reviewing comparable property sales  and obtaining updated real estate appraisals 

table of contents income taxes an income tax benefit of million was recognized in compared to the income tax benefit of  recognized in the increase in income tax benefit was due to a larger pre tax loss in compared to  partially offset by a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  recorded in the company recognized a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in due to uncertainty that deferred tax assets may not be fully realized 
factors that the company considered when recording the valuation allowance included that the company reported a net loss in the previous two years  fdic assessments are expected to increase noninterest expense in future periods  and the uncertainty regarding further other than temporary impairment as a result of further declines in the fair value of securities available for sale 
if the company determines that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized in future periods  the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance by reducing the provision for income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and securities  proceeds from maturities and calls of securities  fhlb advances  and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank maintains a liquidity ratio substantially above the regulatory requirement 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently 
the bank s average regulatory liquidity ratios were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities 
net cash from operating activities were million  million  and  in   and  respectively 
net cash from investing activities consisted primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities  offset by principal collections on loans  proceeds from maturing securities and paydowns on mortgage backed securities 
net cash from investing activities were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of the activity in deposit accounts  fhlb borrowings  and securities sold under repurchase agreements in addition to the purchase of treasury stock 
the net cash used in financing activities was million  million  and million  in   and  respectively 
at december   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a tier core capital level of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and total risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 

table of contents the bank s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and short term investments totaled million 
the bank has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including the repayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
the bank may also utilize fhlb advances or the sale of securities available for sale as a source of funds 
at december  the bank had outstanding fhlb advances of million and had the capacity available to borrow an additional million if needed 
critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans  both of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some quantitative  while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
management is monitoring credit risk trends and the impact on the allowance for loan losses analysis 
securities available for sale securities available are carried at the estimated fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are included as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of deferred income taxes 
the fair value of certain securities is less than amortized cost 
when management believes the decline in fair values below the cost represents an other than temporary impairment  the loss is recognized on the income statement 
the estimated fair value of investment securities are declining in the current market  and management is monitoring the values of its securities available for sale 
the fair value of certain securities was less than amortized cost at december  management believes the decline in market value below cost does not represent an other than temporary impairment  and thus no loss was recognized on the income statement 
real estate owned real estate acquired through foreclosure and similar proceedings is carried at cost fair value at the date of foreclosure or at fair value less estimated costs to sell 
losses on disposition  including expenses incurred in connection with the disposition  are charged to operations 
operating costs after acquisition are expensed 
real estate values are declining in the company s market and management is monitoring the values of its real estate owned properties 

table of contents income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent the assets will more likely than not be realized 
in determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets  the company considers future taxable income and tax planning strategies that  if necessary  would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which the ability to utilize the deferred tax assets would expire 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the level at which it is more likely than not that the tax asset or benefits will be realized 
in the event that the company determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets  the company would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance by reducing the provision for income taxes 
commitments at december   the bank had outstanding commitments to originate mortgage loans of million  as compared to  at december  the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments 
certificate accounts that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from december  totaled million 
management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificate accounts will be renewed at the bank 
however  if these deposits are not retained  the bank may utilize fhlb advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new funds  which may result in higher levels of interest expense and affect the company s level of earnings 

table of contents the following tables disclose contractual obligations and commitments of the company as of december  total less than year years years after years time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase fhlb advances serp liability total contractual cash obligations total amounts committed less than year years years over years loans in process unused lines of credit loan commitments total commitments impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model that estimates the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
an npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule 
under the rule  an institution whose sensitivity measure exceeds would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in 
table of contents calculating its total capital for purposes of the risk based capital requirement 
as of december   the bank s sensitivity measure  as measured by the ots  resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates was and would result in a million decrease in the npv of the bank 
accordingly  increases in interest rates would be expected to have a negative impact on the bank s operating results 
the npv ratio sensitivity measure is below the threshold at which the bank could be required to hold additional risk based capital under ots regulations 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remain constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
the results of this modeling are monitored by management and presented to the board of directors quarterly 
the following tables show the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december  and assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of  and  basis points

the bank and the company do not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments in a material amount to control interest rate risk 
in addition  interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the bank and the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities and operations
