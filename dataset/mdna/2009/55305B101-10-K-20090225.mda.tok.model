the company has homebuilding operations in columbus and cincinnati  ohio  indianapolis  indiana  chicago  illinois  tampa and orlando  florida  charlotte and raleigh  north carolina  and the virginia and maryland suburbs of washington  dc in  the latest year for which information is available  we were the th largest us single family homebuilder based on homes delivered as ranked by builder magazine 
included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are the following topics relevant to the company s performance and financial condition information relating to forward looking statements  our application of critical accounting estimates and policies  our results of operations  discussion of our liquidity and capital resources  summary of our contractual obligations  discussion of our utilization of off balance sheet arrangements  and impact of interest rates and inflation 
forward looking statements certain information included in this report or in other materials we have filed or will file with the securities and exchange commission the sec as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us contains or may contain forward looking statements  including  but not limited to  statements regarding our future financial performance and financial condition 
words such as expects  anticipates  envisions targets  goals  projects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
any forward looking statements that we make herein and in future reports and statements are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results may differ materially from those in such forward looking statements as a result of various risk factors such as the us economy is in the midst of an unprecedented combination of economic turmoil  uncertainty in the credit and financial markets  and worldwide concerns of a financial collapse 
prolonged conditions of this nature could severely impact our ability to operate  the homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant downturn  and its duration and ultimate severity are uncertain in the current state of the economy  continued slowdown in our business will continue to adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  demand for new homes is sensitive to economic conditions over which we have no control  such as the availability of mortgage financing  increasing interest rates could cause defaults for homebuyers who financed homes using non traditional financing products  which could increase the number of homes available for resale  our land investment exposes us to significant risks  including potential impairment write downs  that could negatively impact our profits if the market value of our inventory declines  if we are unable to successfully compete in the highly competitive homebuilding industry  our financial results and growth may suffer  if the current downturn becomes more severe or continues for an extended period of time  it would have continued negative consequences on our operations  financial position  and cash flows  inflation can adversely affect us  particularly in a period of declining home sale prices  our lack of geographic diversification could adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in our markets declines  if we are not able to obtain suitable financing  our business may be negatively impacted  reduced numbers of home sales force us to absorb additional carrying costs  the terms of our indebtedness may restrict our ability to operate  if our financial performance further declines  we may not be able to maintain compliance with the covenants in our credit facilities and senior notes  the ability to incur additional indebtedness could magnify other risk factors  our competitive position could suffer if we were unable to take advantage of acquisition opportunities  we could be adversely affected by a negative change in our credit rating  errors in estimates and judgments that affect decisions about how we operate and on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses could have a material impact on us  we conduct certain of our operations through unconsolidated joint ventures with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest 
these investments involve risks and are highly illiquid  the credit agreement of our financial services segment will expire in may  if our ability to resell mortgages to investors is impaired  we may be required to broker loans  federal laws and regulations that adversely affect liquidity in the secondary mortgage market could hurt our business  recent proposed rule change by the united states department of housing and urban development could negatively impact our operations and revenue  we compete on several levels with homebuilders that may have greater sales and financial resources  which could hurt future earnings  our business requires the use of significant amounts of capital  sources for which may include our credit facility 
in the event we were to amend our credit facility  such amendment could result in lower available commitment amounts and less favorable terms and conditions  which could have a negative impact on our borrowing capacity and or cash flows  our net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code  cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected if legal claims are brought against us and are not resolved in our favor  in the ordinary course of business  we are required to obtain performance bonds  the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and or cash flows  changes in accounting principles  interpretations and practices may affect our reported revenues  earnings and results of operations  we can be injured by failures of persons who act on our behalf to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines  tax law changes could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive  our income tax provision and other tax liabilities may be insufficient if taxing authorities are successful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our position  we experience fluctuations and variability in our operating results on a quarterly basis and  as a result  our historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future results  homebuilding is subject to warranty and liability claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant  natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries  increase costs  and decrease demand for homes in affected areas  supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries  we are subject to extensive government regulations  which could restrict our homebuilding or financial services business  and we are dependent on the services of certain key employees  and the loss of their services could hurt our business

application of critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates such estimates and judgments and makes adjustments as deemed necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
listed below are those estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of a home is recognized when the closing has occurred  title has passed  and an adequate initial and continuing investment by the homebuyer is received  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  or when the loan has been sold to a third party investor 
revenue for homes that close to the buyer having a deposit of or greater  home closings financed by third parties  and all home closings insured under fha or va government insured programs are recorded in the financial statements on the date of closing 
revenue related to all other home closings initially funded by our wholly owned subsidiary  m i financial corp 
m i financial  is recorded on the date that m i financial sells the loan to a third party investor  because the receivable from the third party investor is not subject to future subordination and the company has transferred to this investor the usual risks and rewards of ownership that is in substance a sale and does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the home  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs  home construction costs including an estimate of the costs to complete construction  previously capitalized interest  real estate taxes  indirect costs  and estimated warranty costs 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
sales incentives  including pricing discounts and financing costs paid by the company  are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
sales incentives in the form of options or upgrades are recorded in homebuilding costs in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products 
we recognize the majority of the revenue associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
the revenue recognized is reduced by the fair value of the related guarantee provided to the investor 
the fair value of the guarantee is recognized in revenue when the company is released from its obligation under the guarantee 
generally  all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors within two weeks of origination 
we recognize financial services revenue associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered  and title policies are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
inventory 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with land acquisition and development  and home construction 
inventory is recorded at cost  unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the land may be impaired 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred  and home construction costs  inventory includes capitalized interest  real estate taxes  and certain indirect costs incurred during land development and home construction 
such costs are charged to cost of sales simultaneously with revenue recognition  as discussed above 
when a home is closed  we typically have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
as homes close  we compare the home construction budget to actual recorded costs to date to estimate the additional costs to be incurred from our subcontractors related to the home 
we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to that home 
we monitor the accuracy of such estimate by comparing actual costs incurred in subsequent months to the estimate 
although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from the estimate  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
typically  our building cycle ranges from five to six years  commencing with the acquisition of the entitled land and continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale  construction and closing of the homes 
actual community lives will vary  based on the size of the community and the associated absorption rates 
master planned communities encompassing several phases may have significantly longer lives 
additionally  the current slow down in the housing market has negatively impacted our sales pace  thereby also extending the lives of certain communities 
the company assesses inventory for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in local or national economic conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in conducting our quarterly review for indicators of impairment on a community level  we evaluate  among other things  the margins on homes that have been delivered  margins on sales contracts in backlog  projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community  projected margins with regard to future land sales  and the value of the land itself 
we pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace  and communities whose average sales price and or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward 
from this review  we identify communities whose carrying values may exceed their undiscounted cash flows 
for those communities deemed to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the communities exceeds the fair value of the communities 
our determination of fair value is based on projections and estimates 
changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis 
our analysis is completed on a quarterly basis at a community level  therefore  changes in local conditions may affect one or several of our communities 
for the year ended december   the company evaluated all communities for impairment indicators 
a recoverability analysis was performed for communities and an impairment charge was recorded in of those communities 
the carrying value of those impaired communities was million at december  for all of the categories listed below  the key assumptions relating to the valuations are dependent on project specific local market and or community conditions and are inherently uncertain 
because each inventory asset is unique  there are numerous inputs and assumptions used in our valuation techniques 
local market specific factors that may impact these projected assumptions include historical project results such as average sales price and sales rates  if closings have occurred in the project  competitors local market and or community presence and their competitive actions  project specific attributes such as location desirability and uniqueness of product offering  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts  and community specific strategies regarding speculative homes 
operating communities 
for existing operating communities  the recoverability of assets is measured on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home sales 
these estimated cash flows are developed based primarily on management s assumptions relating to the specific community 
the significant assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of assets include the timing of development and or marketing phases  projected sales price and sales pace of each existing or planned community  the estimated land development  home construction  and selling costs of the community  overall market supply and demand  the local market  and competitive conditions 
management reviews these assumptions on a quarterly basis 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the end of a reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
these assumptions vary widely across different communities and geographies and are largely dependent on local market conditions 
future communities 
for raw land or land under development that management anticipates will be utilized for future homebuilding activities  the recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home sales  consistent with the evaluations performed for operating communities discussed above 
for raw land  land under development  or lots that management intends to market for sale to a third party  but that do not meet all of the criteria to be classified as land held for sale as discussed below  the recoverability of the assets is determined based on either the estimated net sales proceeds expected to be realized on the sale of the assets or the estimated fair value determined using cash flow valuation techniques 
if the company has not yet determined whether raw land or land under development will be utilized for future homebuilding activities or marketed for sale to a third party  the company assesses the recoverability of the inventory using a probability weighted approach  in accordance with sfas land held for sale 
land held for sale includes land that meets all of the following six criteria  as defined in sfas management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated  the sale of the asset is probable  and transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale  within one year  the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value  and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
in accordance with sfas  the company records land held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
in performing impairment evaluation for land held for sale  management considers  among other things  prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions  market analysis and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties  as well as actual contracts 
if the estimated fair value less the costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
for all of the above categories  the key assumptions relating to the above valuations are dependent on project specific local market and or community conditions and are inherently uncertain 
because each inventory asset is unique  there are numerous inputs and assumptions used in our valuation techniques 
local market specific factors that may impact our project assumptions include historical project results such as average sales price and sales rates  if closings have occurred in the project  competitors local market and or community presence and their competitive actions  project specific attributes such as location desirability and uniqueness of product offering  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts  community specific strategies regarding speculative homes 
these and other local market specific factors that may impact project assumptions discussed above are considered by personnel in our homebuilding divisions as they prepare or update the forecasted assumptions for each community 
quantitative and qualitative factors other than home sales prices could significantly impact the potential for future impairments 
the sales objectives can differ between communities  even within a given sub market 
for example  facts and circumstances in a given community may lead us to price our homes with the objective of yielding a higher sales absorption pace  while facts and circumstances in another community may lead us to price our homes to minimize deterioration in our gross margins  although it may result in a slower sales absorption pace 
furthermore  the key assumptions included in our estimated future undiscounted cash flows may be interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated base sales price or an increase in home sales incentives may result in a corresponding increase in sales absorption pace 
additionally  a decrease in the average sales price of homes to be sold and closed in future reporting periods for one community that has not been generating what management believes to be an adequate sales absorption pace may impact the estimated cash flow assumptions of a nearby community 
changes in our key assumptions  including estimated construction and development costs  absorption pace  selling strategies  or discount rates  could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates 
as of december   our projections generally assume a gradual improvement in market conditions over time  along with a gradual increase in costs 
these assumed gradual increases generally begin in  depending on the market and community 
if communities are not recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of a community is determined by discounting management s cash flow projections using an appropriate risk adjusted interest rate 
as of december   we utilized discount rates ranging from to in the above valuations 
the discount rate used in determining each asset s fair value depends on the community s projected life  development stage  and the inherent risks associated with the related estimated cash flow stream as well as current risk free rates available in the market and estimated market risk premiums 
for example  construction in progress inventory  which is closer to completion  will generally require a lower discount rate than land under development in communities consisting of multiple phases spanning several years of development 
we believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community 
a higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites within the community  while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community 
our quarterly assessments reflect management s estimates 
due to the uncertainties related to our operations and our industry as a whole as further discussed in risk factors beginning on page of this annual report on form k  we are unable to determine at this time if and to what extent continuing changes in our local markets will result in future impairments 
consolidated inventory not owned 
we enter into land option agreements in the ordinary course of business in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  we typically provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at pre determined prices 
if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity  the company s deposit including letters of credit represents a variable interest in the entity  and we must use our judgment to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include the amount of the deposit in relation to the fair value of the land  the expected timing of our purchase of the land  and assumptions about projected cash flows 
we consider our accounting policies with respect to determining whether we are the primary beneficiary to be critical accounting policies due to the judgment required 
we also periodically enter into lot option arrangements with third parties to whom we have sold our raw land inventory 
we evaluate these transactions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for product financing arrangements  and fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r to determine if we should record an asset and liability at the time we sell the land and enter into the lot option contract 
investment in unconsolidated limited liability companies 
we invest in entities that acquire and develop land for distribution to us in connection with our homebuilding operations 
in our judgment  we have determined that these entities generally do not meet the criteria of variable interest entities because they have sufficient equity to finance their operations 
we must use our judgment to determine if we have substantive control or exercise significant influence over these entities 
if we were to determine that we have substantive control or exercise significant influence over an entity  we would be required to consolidate the entity 
factors considered in determining whether we have substantive control or exercise significant influence over an entity include risk and reward sharing  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions  and continuing involvement 
in the event an entity does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations  we would be required to use judgment to determine if we were the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
we consider our accounting policies with respect to determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have substantive control or exercise significant influence over an entity to be critical accounting policies due to the judgment required 
based on the application of our accounting policies  these entities are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of investments in common stock  and sec staff accounting bulletin sab topic m  other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company evaluates its investment in unconsolidated limited liability companies llcs for potential impairment on a quarterly basis 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the investment s carrying value and the company has determined that the decline in value is other than temporary  the company would write down the value of the investment to fair value 
the determination of whether an investment s fair value is less than the carrying value requires management to make certain assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future contributions to the llc  the timing of distribution of lots to the company from the llc  the projected fair value of the lots at the time of distribution to the company  and the estimated proceeds from  and timing of  the sale of land or lots to third parties 
in determining the fair value of investments in unconsolidated llcs  the company evaluates the projected cash flows associated with the llc using a probability weighted approach based on the likelihood of different outcomes 
as of december   the company used a discount rate of in determining the fair value of investments in unconsolidated llcs 
in addition to the assumptions management must make to determine if the investment s fair value is less than the carrying value  management must also use judgment in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary 
the factors management considers are the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the company  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the limited liability company for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
in situations where the investments are equity financed by the partners  and the joint venture simply distributes lots to its partners  the company evaluates other than temporary by preparing an undiscounted cash flow model as described in inventory above for operating communities 
if such model results in positive value versus carrying value  and the fair value of the investment is less than the investment s carrying value  the company determines that the impairment is temporary  otherwise  the company determines that the impairment is other than temporary and impairs the investment 
because of the high degree of judgment involved in developing these assumptions  it is possible that the company may determine the investment is not impaired in the current period but  due to passage of time or change in market conditions leading to changes in assumptions  impairment could occur 
guarantees and indemnities 
guarantee and indemnity liabilities are established by charging the applicable income statement or balance sheet line  depending on the nature of the guarantee or indemnity  and crediting a liability 
m i financial provides a limited life guarantee on loans sold to certain third parties and estimates its actual liability related to the guarantee and any indemnities subsequently provided to the purchaser of the loans in lieu of loan repurchase based on historical loss experience 
actual future costs associated with loans guaranteed or indemnified could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
the company has also provided certain other guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the purchase and development of land  including environmental indemnifications  guarantees of the completion of land development  a loan maintenance and limited payment guaranty  and minimum net worth guarantees of certain subsidiaries 
the company estimates these liabilities based on the estimated cost of insurance coverage or estimated cost of acquiring a bond in the amount of the exposure 
actual future costs associated with these guarantees and indemnifications could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
warranty 
warranty accruals are established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty accrual for each home closed 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and outside labor required under the company s warranty programs 
accruals are recorded for warranties under the following warranty programs home builder s limited warranty warranty program which became effective for homes closed starting with the third quarter of  year transferable structural warranty effective for homes closed after april   two year limited warranty program effective prior to the implementation of the home builder s limited warranty  and year transferable structural warranty effective for homes closed between september  and april  the warranty accruals for the home builder s limited warranty and two year limited warranty program are established as a percentage of average sales price  and the structural warranty accruals are established on a per unit basis 
our warranty accruals are based upon historical experience by geographic area and recent trends 
factors that are given consideration in determining the accruals include the historical range of amounts paid per average sales price on a home  type and mix of amenity packages added to the home  any warranty expenditures included in the above not considered to be normal and recurring  timing of payments  improvements in quality of construction expected to impact future warranty expenditures  actuarial estimates  which reflect both company and industry data  and conditions that may affect certain projects and require a different percentage of average sales price for those specific projects 
changes in estimates for warranties occur due to changes in the historical payment experience and differences between the actual payment pattern experienced during the period and the historical payment pattern used in our evaluation of the warranty accrual balance at the end of each quarter 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our current estimated amount 
self insurance 
self insurance accruals are made for estimated liabilities associated with employee health care  ohio workers compensation  and general liability insurance 
our self insurance limit for employee health care is  per claim per year for fiscal  with stop loss insurance covering amounts in excess of  up to  per claim per year 
our self insurance limit for workers compensation is  per claim  with stop loss insurance covering all amounts in excess of this limit 
the accruals related to employee health care and workers compensation are based on historical experience and open cases 
our general liability claims are insured by a third party  the company generally has a million deductible per occurrence and an million deductible in the aggregate  with lower deductibles for certain types of claims 
the company records a general liability accrual for claims falling below the company s deductible 
the general liability accrual estimate is based on an actuarial evaluation of our past history of claims and other industry specific factors 
the company has recorded expenses totaling million  million and million  respectively  for all self insured and general liability claims during the years ended december   and because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated accrual amounts  actual future costs could differ from our current estimated amounts 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements 
we calculate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected dividend yield  and the expected term of the option 
in addition  when we first issue share based awards  we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
derivative financial instruments 
to meet financing needs of our home buying customers  m i financial is party to interest rate lock commitments irlcs  which are extended to customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
these irlcs are considered derivative financial instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
m i financial manages interest rate risk related to its irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbss  use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments and the occasional purchase of options on fmbss in accordance with company policy 
these fmbss  options on fmbss  and irlcs covered by fmbss are considered non designated derivatives 
the company adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  and sab no 
 written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings  for irlcs entered into in in determining fair value of irlcs  m i financial considers the value of the resulting loan if sold in the secondary market 
the fair value includes the price that the loan is expected to be sold for along with the value of servicing release premiums 
the fair value of irlcs entered into in and before excludes the value of the servicing release premium in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance at that time 
this determines the initial fair value  which is indexed to zero at inception 
subsequent to inception  m i financial estimates an updated fair value which is compared to the initial fair value 
in addition  m i financial uses fallout estimates which fluctuate based on the rate of the irlc in relation to current rates 
in accordance with sfas and related derivatives implementation group conclusions  gains or losses are recorded in financial services revenue 
certain irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale are committed to third party investors through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments 
in accordance with sfas  the irlcs and related best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  which generally are highly effective from an economic standpoint  are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value  with gains or losses recorded in financial services revenue 
under the terms of these best efforts whole loan delivery commitments covering mortgage loans held for sale  the specific committed mortgage loans held for sale are identified and matched to specific delivery commitments on a loan by loan basis 
the delivery commitments are designated as fair value hedges of the mortgage loans held for sale  and both the delivery commitments and loans held for sale are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in financial services revenue 
income taxes valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  a valuation allowance is recorded against a deferred tax asset if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under applicable tax law 
the four sources of taxable income to be considered in determining whether a valuation allowance is required include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary requires an analysis of both positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets 
examples of positive evidence may include a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the deductible temporary differences  coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is the result of an aberration rather than a continuing condition  an excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of a company s net assets in an amount sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset  and existing backlog that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures 
examples of negative evidence may include the existence of cumulative losses defined as a pre tax cumulative loss for the business cycle in our case four years  a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief that it would limit the realization of tax benefits  a history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused  and unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  the company evaluates its deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
sfas requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
sfas provides that a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable  and also restricts the amount of reliance on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets 
the company s current and prior year losses present the most significant negative evidence as to whether the company needs to reduce its deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance 
given the continued downturn in the homebuilding industry during  we are now in a four year cumulative pre tax loss position during the years through we currently believe the cumulative weight of the negative evidence exceeds that of the positive evidence and  as a result  it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
therefore  during  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax assets  million of which relates to beginning of the year deferred tax assets and million of which relates to deferred tax assets that arose in as a result of operating activities 
the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future results 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurable with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
we must use judgment in considering the relative impact of positive and negative evidence 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a non cash charge of million for a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
future adjustments to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of our net deferred tax assets 
in  we do not expect to record any additional tax benefits as the carryback has been exhausted 
additionally  our determination with respect to recording a valuation allowance may be further impacted by  among other things additional inventory impairments  additional pre tax operating losses  the utilization of tax planning strategies that could accelerate the realization of certain deferred tax assets  or changes in relevant tax law 
additionally  due to the considerable estimates utilized in establishing a valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods  it is reasonably possible that we will be required to either increase or decrease our valuation allowance in future reporting periods

highlights and trends for the year ended december  overview the united states is in the midst of an unprecedented combination of economic turmoil  uncertainty in the credit and financial markets  and worldwide concerns of a financial collapse 
since the fourth quarter of fiscal  we have experienced a slowdown in our business 
this slowdown has worsened over the past several months 
this slowdown  which we believe started with a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes  and an oversupply of homes available for sale  has been exacerbated by  among other things  a decline in the overall economy  increasing unemployment  fear of job loss  a significant decline in the securities markets  the continuing decline in home prices  the large number of homes that are or will be available due to foreclosures  the inability of some of our home buyers to sell their current home  the deterioration in the credit markets  and the direct and indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market 
we believe that the key to a recovery in our business is the return of consumer confidence and a stabilization of financial markets and home prices 
potential home buyers  reacting to industry specific factors and these broader economic concerns  are likely to stay on the sidelines until the economic and financial picture becomes clearer 
on february   president obama signed the billion american recovery and reinvestment act into law 
this stimulus package includes  among other things  an  tax credit for new home purchases that occur between january  and december  we continue our primarily defensive staregy  wich includes adjusting our approach to land acquisition and development and construction practices and continue to shorten our land pipeline  limiting land development expenditures  reducing production volumes  and working to try to balance home prices and profitability with sales pace  although our primary focus at this point is generating cash and liquidity 
we are concerned about the dislocation in the secondary mortgage market 
we maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage financial institutions  most of which are among the largest and  we believe  most reliable in the industry 
our buyers generally have been able to obtain adequate financing 
nevertheless  tightening credit standards have shrunk the pool of potential home buyers and the availability of certain loan products previously available to our home buyers 
mortgage market liquidity issues and higher borrowing rates may impede some of our home buyers from closing  while others may find it more difficult to sell their existing homes as their prospective buyers face the problem of obtaining a mortgage 
we believe that our home buyers generally should be able to continue to secure mortgages 
because we cannot predict the short and long term liquidity of the credit markets  we continue to caution that  with the uncertainties in these markets  the pace of home sales could slow further until these markets stabilize 
based on our experience during prior downturns in the housing market  we believe that unexpected opportunities may arise in difficult times for those builders that are well prepared 
in the current challenging environment  we believe our balance sheet  liquidity and access to capital  our commitment to customer service  our geographic presence  our diversified product lines  our experienced personnel  and our brand name all position us well for such opportunities now and in the future 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and approximately million available under our revolving credit facility  which extends to  along with an expected tax refund of million 
we believe we have the resources available to fund attractive opportunities  should they arise 
when our industry recovers  we believe that we will see reduced competition from the small and mid sized private builders  leading to our ability to increase our market share in our existing markets 
we believe that the access of these private builders to capital already appears to be severely constrained 
we envision that there will be fewer and more selective lenders serving our industry at that time 
those lenders likely will gravitate to the home building companies that offer them the greatest security  the healthiest balance sheets and the broadest array of potential business opportunities 
we believe that this reduced competition  combined with attractive long term demographics  will reward those builders who can persevere through the current challenging environment 
notwithstanding the current market conditions  and as market conditions improve over time  we believe that geographic and product diversification  access to lower cost capital  and strong demographics have in the past  and will in the future  benefit those builders that can control land and persevere through the increasingly difficult regulatory approval process 
we believe that these factors favor the large publicly traded home building companies with the capital and expertise to control home sites and gain market share 
we believe that  as builders reduce the number of home sites being taken through the approval process and this process continues to become more difficult  and if the political pressure from no growth proponents continues to increase  our expertise in taking land through the approval process and our already approved land positions will allow us to grow in the years to come 
we are also delaying planned land purchases and development spending and have significantly reduced our total number of controlled lots owned and under option 
while we will continue to purchase select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so  we currently anticipate minimal investment in new land parcels in the near term 
we have also closely evaluated and made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead expenses and have put in place strategic plans to reduce costs and improve ongoing operating efficiencies 
given the persistence of these difficult market conditions  improving the efficiency of our overhead costs will continue to be a significant area of focus 
we believe that these measures will help to strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that may develop when the homebuilding industry stabilizes 
given the continued weakness in new home sales and closings  visibility as to future earnings performance is limited 
our outlook is tempered with caution  as conditions in many of the markets we serve have become increasingly challenging 
our evaluation for land related charges recorded to date assumed our best estimates of cash flows for the communities tested 
if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes  we may be required to evaluate our assets  including additional communities  for additional impairments or write downs  which could result in additional charges that might be significant 
key financial results for the year ended december   total revenue decreased million to approximately million when compared to the year ended december  this decrease is largely attributable to a decrease of million in housing revenue  from million in to million in due to both a decline in homes delivered and the average sales price of homes delivered 
homes delivered decreased  from  in to  in  and the average sales price of homes delivered decreased from  to  our financial services revenue also decreased million in compared to due primarily to a decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes for increased by million from million in to million in during  the company incurred charges totaling million  compared to million in related to the impairment of inventory  investment in unconsolidated llcs  and abandoned land transaction costs 
excluding the impact of the above mentioned charges  the company had a pre tax loss of million in compared to pre tax income of million in the million increase in pre tax loss from was driven by the decrease in housing revenue discussed above  along with lower pre impairment gross margins  which declined from in to in general and administrative expenses decreased million from to primarily due to a decrease of million in payroll and incentive expenses  a decrease of million in intangible amortization due to the write off of goodwill and other assets  a decrease of million in land related expenses  including abandoned projects and deposit write offs  and a decrease of million in advertising expenses 
selling expenses decreased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  primarily due to a million decrease in variable selling expenses  a million decrease in model home expenses  a million decrease in advertising expenses  a million decrease in payroll related expenses  and a million decrease in expenses related to our sales offices 
new contracts for were  down compared to  in for the year ended december   our cancellation rate was compared to in by region  our cancellation rates in versus were as follows midwest in and in  florida in and in  and mid atlantic in and in our mortgage company s capture rate increased from for the year ended december  to approximately for the year ended december  capture rate is influenced by financing availability and can fluctuate up or down from period to period 
we continue to deal with very weak and ever changing market conditions that require us to constantly monitor the value of our inventory and investments in unconsolidated llcs in those markets in which we operate  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of charges relating to the impairment of inventory and investment in unconsolidated llcs and write off of abandoned land transaction costs  compared to million of charges during the year ended december  we generally believe that we will see a gradual improvement in market conditions over the long term 
in  we will continue to update our evaluation of the value of our inventory and investments in unconsolidated llcs for impairment  and could be required to record additional impairment charges  which would negatively impact earnings should market conditions deteriorate further or results differ from management s original assumptions 
in  the company recorded a non cash tax charge of million for a valuation allowance related to its deferred tax assets 
this was reflected as a charge to income tax expense and resulted in a reduction of the company s net deferred tax assets 
consequently  the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to an effective tax rate of in due to the uncertainty of future market conditions  we cannot give any predictions as to our effective tax rate

seasonality and variability in quarterly results we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels 
in most years  homes delivered increase substantially in the third and fourth quarters 
we believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter  as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions 
we also have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonality in our financial services operations  because loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations

interest expense for the company decreased million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in our weighted average borrowings from million in to million in  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in interest capitalized  due primarily to a significant reduction in land development activities  and a slight increase in our weighted average borrowing rate  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  midwest region

partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered from  in to  in the decrease in the average sales price of home delivered primarily relates to the sales discounts being offered in our washington  dc market  which has lowered the average sales price of our homes in that market 
our mid atlantic region had an operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  this decrease in operating income was primarily due to a million charge relating to the impairment of inventory and the write off of certain land and lot deposits and pre acquisition costs in our mid atlantic region

approximately of our homes delivered during that were financed were through m i financial  compared to in general and administrative expenses decreased million due to a decrease in payroll and incentive related costs due to headcount reductions in response to market conditions 
corporate selling  general and administrative expense 
corporate general and administrative expenses decreased million  from million in to million in  due to a decrease of million in payroll and profit based incentive compensation as a result of the decline in our overall operating results when compared to corporate selling expense decreased million from due to a decrease in training expenses of million in interest net 
interest expense decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the primary reason for this decrease was the million decrease in interest incurred due to a decrease in our weighted average borrowings of million in when compared to this decrease was almost entirely offset by a million decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to a decrease in housing construction and land development activities and an increase in our weighted average borrowing rate from in to in liquidity and capital resources operating cash flow activities funding for our business has been provided principally by cash flow from operating activities  before inventory additions  unsecured bank borrowings  and the public debt and equity markets 
prior to  we used our cash flow from operating activities  before inventory additions  bank borrowings and the proceeds of public debt and equity offerings  to acquire additional land for new communities  fund additional expenditures for land development  fund construction costs needed to meet the requirements of our backlog  invest in unconsolidated entities  repurchase our common shares  and repay debt 
during the year ended december   we generated million of cash from our operating activities  compared to million of cash from our operating activities during the million net cash generated during was primarily a result of a million tax refund  million net conversion of inventory into cash as a result of home closings as well as third party land sales 
the net cash generated was also due to the million net reduction in mortgage loans held for sale due to proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans being in excess of new loan originations during the period 
partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease due to other operating activities  including million in accounts payable and million in customer deposits 
the primary reason for the million decrease in cash generated from operating activities from to is due to the decline in cash received from third party land sales  which was million in  compared to including the collection of a million receivable million in beginning in the second half of  we began reducing our land purchases  and during  we purchased million of land and lots 
we have entered into land option agreements in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  we have provided deposits to land sellers totaling million as of december  as consideration for the right to purchase land and lots in the future  including the right to purchase million of land and lots during the years through we evaluate our future land purchases on an ongoing basis  taking into consideration current and projected market conditions  and negotiate terms with sellers  as necessary  based on market conditions and our existing land supply by market 
at december   we owned or controlled through options approximately  home sites  as compared to approximately  at december  in  we put forth a strong effort to market our speculative homes with special incentives 
as a result of that effort  we reduced our speculative inventory by  going from speculative homes in to in while many of those speculative homes were the result of customer contract cancellations  we are also strategically building speculative homes as the nature of the homebuilding market right now requires readily available homes for purchase 
customers today are not entering into contacts until they sell their existing home  and once it s sold  they usually need to purchase and move into a home within a short amount of time  and speculative homes are usually ready to move into within a short time of signing a contract 
should our business remain at its current level or decline from present levels  we believe that our inventory levels would continue to decrease as we complete and deliver the homes under construction but do not commence construction of as many new homes  as we complete the improvements on the land we already own and as we sell and deliver the speculative homes that are currently in inventory  resulting in additional cash flow from operations 
investing cash flow activities for the year ended december   we generated million of cash  primarily due to the proceeds of million from the exchange of our airplane  which was partially offset by million used for additional investments in certain of our unconsolidated llcs  along with million in property and equipment purchases 
the company is currently pursuing the sale of its airplane 
financing cash flow activities for the year ended december   we used million of cash 
using the million tax refund that we received in  along with cash generated from operations  we repaid million under our revolving credit facilities 
during the year ended december   we paid a total of million in dividends  which includes million in dividends paid on our series a preferred shares 
the indenture governing our senior notes contains a provision that restricts the payment of dividends on our common or preferred shares when the calculation of the consolidated restricted payments basket  as defined therein  falls below zero  which it did during the second quarter of as a result  we are restricted from making any further dividend payments on our common or preferred shares until such time as the restricted payments basket has been restored or our senior notes are repaid  and our board of directors authorizes us to resume dividend payments 
our homebuilding and financial services operations financing needs depend on anticipated sales volume in the current year as well as future years  inventory levels and related turnover  forecasted land and lot purchases  and other company plans 
we fund these operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our bank credit facilities  and from time to time  issuances of new debt and or equity securities  as management deems necessary 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness  and may incur substantial indebtedness in the future  to fund our homebuilding activities 
we routinely monitor current operational requirements  financial market conditions  and credit relationships 
we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term liquidity requirements 
however  we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are necessary if market conditions continue to deteriorate and extend beyond our expectations 
we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources and our existing sources of credit 
due to the deterioration of the credit markets and the uncertainties that exist in the economy and for home builders in general  we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future

d the company is party to land purchase option agreements to acquire developed lots from sellers who are variable interest entities 
the company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities  and therefore is required under financial accounting standards board interpretation r  consolidation of variable interest entities to consolidate the entities 
as of december   the company has recorded a liability of million relating to consolidation of these variable interest entities 
the actual cash payments that the company will make in the future will be based upon the number of lots acquired each period under the option agreements and the related per lot prices in effect at that time 
one of the land purchase option agreements has specific performance provisions 
we are required to purchase million of land in the future  but at this time cannot accurately specify the time period 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this obligation 
e the amount reported herein of million represents principal and interest for a bond obligation incurred in connection with the acquisition of lots in a community in florida 
this obligation will be repaid as the company closes on the lots in this community to third parties 
the estimated payments by period above have been estimated based on the expected timing of closings 
in addition  in connection with the development of certain of the company s communities  local government entities have been established and bonds have been issued by those entities to finance a portion of the related infrastructure 
these community development district obligations represent obligations of the company as the current holder of the property  net of cash held by the district available to offset the particular bond obligations 
as of december   the company has recorded a liability of million relating to these community development district obligations 
however  the actual cash payments that the company will ultimately make will be dependent upon the timing of the sale of those lots within the district to third parties 
because we are unable to estimate the timing of such sales  the amounts have not been included above 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these obligations 
f the company has obligations with certain subcontractors and suppliers of raw materials in the ordinary course of business to meet the commitment to deliver homes with an aggregate sales price of million 
based on our current housing gross margin of  exclusive of impairment charges  less variable selling costs of of revenue  less costs already incurred on homes in backlog  we estimate payments totaling approximately million to be made in relating to those homes 
g the company has options and contingent purchase agreements to acquire land and developed lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
purchase of properties is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the company and the sellers and therefore the timing of payments under these agreements is not determinable 
the company has no specific performance obligations with respect to these agreements 
h we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and local jurisdictions 
as of december   we had million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  including million of related accrued interest and million of related accrued penalties 
we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months 
however  the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable 
the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination of tax years through off balance sheet arrangements our primary use of off balance sheet arrangements is for the purpose of securing the most desirable lots on which to build homes for our homebuyers in a manner that we believe reduces the overall risk to the company 
our off balance sheet arrangements relating to our homebuilding operations include unconsolidated llcs  land option agreements  guarantees and indemnifications associated with acquiring and developing land  and the issuance of letters of credit and completion bonds 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  our financial services operations issue guarantees and indemnities relating to the sale of loans to third parties 
unconsolidated limited liability companies 
in the ordinary course of business  the company periodically enters into arrangements with third parties to acquire land and develop lots 
these arrangements include the creation by the company of llcs  with the company s interest in these entities ranging from to 
these entities engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing in the form of a capital distribution or selling developed lots to the company and its partners in the entity 
these entities generally do not meet the criteria of variable interest entities vies  because the equity at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from the equity investors  however  we must evaluate each entity to determine whether it is or is not a vie 
if an entity was determined to be a vie  we would then evaluate whether or not we are the primary beneficiary 
these evaluations are initially performed when each new entity is created and upon any events that require reconsideration of the entity 
we have determined that none of the llcs in which we have an interest are vies  and we also have determined that we do not have substantive control or exercise significant influence over any of these entities  therefore  our homebuilding llcs are recorded using the equity method of accounting 
the company believes its maximum exposure related to any of these entities as of december  to be the amount invested of million  plus letters of credit and bonds totaling million that serve as completion bonds for the development work in progress and our possible future obligations under guarantees and indemnifications provided in connection with these entities  as further discussed in note and note of our consolidated financial statements 
land option agreements 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into land option agreements in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  the company will provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at predetermined prices 
because the entities holding the land under the option agreement often meet the criteria for vies  the company evaluates all land option agreements to determine if it is necessary to consolidate any of these entities 
the company currently believes that its maximum exposure as of december  related to these agreements is equal to the amount of the company s outstanding deposits  which totaled million  including cash deposits of million  prepaid acquisition costs of million  letters of credit of million and corporate promissory notes of million 
guarantees and indemnities 
in the ordinary course of business  m i financial enters into agreements that guarantee purchasers of its mortgage loans that m i financial will repurchase a loan if certain conditions occur 
m i financial has also provided indemnifications to certain third party investors and insurers in lieu of repurchasing certain loans 
the risks associated with these guarantees and indemnities are offset by the value of the underlying assets  and the company accrues its best estimate of the probable loss on these loans 
additionally  the company has provided certain other guarantees and indemnities in connection with the acquisition and development of land by our homebuilding operations 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for additional details relating to our guarantees and indemnities 
letters of credit and completion bonds 
the company provides standby letters of credit and completion bonds for development work in progress  deposits on land and lot purchase agreements and miscellaneous deposits 
as of december   the company had outstanding million of completion bonds and standby letters of credit  some of which were issued to various local governmental entities  that expire at various times through december included in this total are million of performance and maintenance bonds and million of performance letters of credit that serve as completion bonds for land development work in progress including the company s million share of our llcs letters of credit and bonds  million of financial letters of credit  of which million represents deposits on land and lot purchase agreements  and million of financial bonds 
interest rates and inflation our business is significantly affected by general economic conditions of the united states of america and  particularly  by the impact of interest rates and inflation 
higher interest rates may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them 
the impact of increased rates can be offset  in part  by offering variable rate loans with lower interest rates 
in conjunction with our mortgage financing services  hedging methods are used to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations between the commitment date of the loan and the time the loan closes 
during the past year  we have experienced some detrimental effect from inflation  particularly the inflation in the cost of land that occurred over the past several years 
as a result of declines in market conditions in most of our markets  in certain communities we have been unable to recover the cost of these higher land prices  resulting in lower gross margins and significant charges being recorded in our operating results due to the impairment of inventory and investments in unconsolidated llcs  and other write offs relating to deposits and pre acquisition costs of abandoned land transactions 
in recent years  we have not experienced a detrimental effect from inflation in relation to our home construction costs  and we have been successful in reducing certain of these costs with our subcontractors in the current year 
however  unanticipated construction costs or a change in market conditions may occur during the period between the date sales contracts are entered into with customers and the delivery date of the related homes  resulting in lower gross profit margins
