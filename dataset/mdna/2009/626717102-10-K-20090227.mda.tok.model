item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview murphy oil corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in the united states and united kingdom 
a more detailed description of the company s significant assets can be found in item of this form k report 
murphy generates revenue primarily by selling oil and natural gas production and refined petroleum products to customers at hundreds of locations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  malaysia and other countries 
the company s revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells 
also  because crude oil is purchased by the company for refinery feedstocks  natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil fields  and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in the us that are primarily located at walmart supercenters  the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the company s costs 
in order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business  revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products  amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration 
profits and generation of cash in the company s refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins  which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing  transporting and marketing these products 
murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions 
worldwide oil and north american natural gas prices were significantly higher in than in the average price for a barrel of west texas intermediate crude oil in was  an increase of compared to the nymex natural gas price in averaged per million british thermal units mmbtu  up from crude oil and natural gas prices generally rose during the first half of with oil prices reaching their high in july 
both crude oil and north american natural gas prices have fallen precipitously near the end of and remain soft in early changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the company  especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis by the company in in  the percentage of hydrocarbon production represented by oil is expected to decline to about due to new natural gas fields at kikeh and block sk in malaysia and tupper in british columbia 
if the prices for crude oil and natural gas remain weak in or beyond  the company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business 
such lower oil and gas prices could  but may not  have a favorable impact on the company s refining and marketing operating profits 
results of operations the company had net income in of billion  per diluted share  compared to net income in of million  per diluted share 
in the company s net income was million  per diluted share 
the significant increase in net income compared to was caused by higher earnings in the exploration and production operations  primarily due to higher sales prices for the company s oil and natural gas production  higher crude oil production volumes and gains on disposal of two assets in canada 
the earnings for the company s refining and marketing operations were an annual record in and improved from  primarily in the uk and mostly caused by the december purchase of of the milford haven  wales refinery 
the net cost of corporate activities not allocated to the operating segments was higher in than in the net income improvement in compared to primarily related to higher earnings generated by both the exploration and production and refining and marketing businesses  but partially offset by higher net costs for corporate activities 
further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections 
vs 
net income in was billion  per diluted share  compared to million  per diluted share  in the consolidated net income improvement of million in was attributable to higher earnings in both exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m operations 
the net cost of corporate activities in was higher than in  partially offsetting the improved results in e p and r m 
earnings in the e p business were markedly improved in  increasing by million compared to  as this business benefited from both higher sales prices for oil and natural gas  higher sales volumes for crude oil and gains from asset dispositions 
e p earnings were unfavorably affected in compared to by lower sales volumes for natural gas and higher expenses for exploration  production  depreciation  depletion and administration 
the r m business generated record profits in  increasing million compared to the improvement was primarily due to refining profits generated in the uk in the current year following the acquisition of the remaining of the milford haven  wales  refinery in december r m earnings in included an unfavorable impact from noncash inventory revaluations 
following the milford haven acquisition  the company s uk operations recorded an after tax noncash last in  first out accounting charge of million in to reduce the carrying value of crude oil and refined products inventory to beginning of year prices  which were significantly lower than at the end of the year 
the net costs of corporate activities increased by million in compared to  with the cost increase mostly attributable to higher losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and higher net expenses for interest and administration 
the foreign currency losses occurred because the us dollar generally strengthened against other significant foreign currencies used in the company s business in  especially compared to the british pound sterling 
the higher net interest expense was mostly caused by lower interest capitalized to e p development projects 
the period included higher corporate administrative costs mostly due to higher expense for employee compensation and community and other support activities 

table of contents sales and other operating revenues were billion higher in than in mostly due to higher sales prices and sales volumes for gasoline and other refined products  higher sales prices and sales volumes for crude oil produced by the company  and higher revenues from merchandise sales at retail gasoline stations 
sales prices for natural gas were higher in than  but the favorable price variance was somewhat offset by lower natural gas sales volumes in the current year 
gain loss on sales of assets in was million higher than in and these realized pretax gains were primarily associated with the sales of its interests in berkana energy and the lloydminster area heavy oil properties in canada 
interest and other income was lower by million in due primarily to greater losses on foreign currency exchange  which in the current year was mostly attributable to a generally stronger us dollar compared to the british pound sterling 
crude oil and product purchases expense increased by billion in compared to due to a combination of higher purchase prices and throughput volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks at the company s refineries  higher prices and volumes of refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations  and higher levels of merchandise purchased for sale at the gasoline stations 
the higher crude oil purchase volumes in were caused by a full year of operations at the milford haven  wales refinery in following the december purchase of the remaining interest 
operating expenses increased by million in compared to and included higher refinery and retail station costs  and higher costs for oil field operations in malaysia and synthetic oil operations at syncrude 
refining costs increased due to both higher natural gas and other fuel costs and the full year of operations at milford haven following the acquisition 
exploration expenses were million higher in than in and were primarily associated with higher leasehold amortization expenses at the tupper area in british columbia  more dry hole expense in malaysia and australia  and higher geophysical expenses in suriname 
additionally  included costs for settlement of two work commitments on leases formerly held on the scotian shelf offshore eastern canada 
selling and general expenses were million higher in than in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million higher in compared to due mostly to higher crude oil production volumes  but also due to higher barrel equivalent unit rates for depreciation for virtually all e p segments and higher depreciation for the milford haven  wales refinery acquired in december impairment of long lived assets of million in primarily related to closing underperforming gasoline stations in the us and canada 
accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by million in due to additional abandonment obligations incurred as additional kikeh development wells were drilled during the year and higher estimated costs of future abandonment obligations at syncrude 
net costs associated with hurricanes of million in was due to a downward adjustment of anticipated insurance recoveries at the meraux refinery following hurricane katrina based on updated loss limits communicated in by the company s primary property insurer 
interest expense incurred in was million less than in due to lower average debt levels during compared to the prior year 
the amount of interest costs capitalized to property  plant and equipment decreased by million in due to lower levels of interest allocable to worldwide e p development projects 
minority interest was insignificant and was associated with the operations of berkana energy in canada that was sold in january income tax expense was million higher in than in and was mainly attributable to a higher level of pretax earnings 
the effective income tax rate for consolidated earnings increased from in to in the tax rate in both years was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to a combination of us state income taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceed the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the uncertain ability of the company to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years 
vs 
net income in was million  per diluted share  compared to million  per diluted share  in the improvement in consolidated net income in of million compared to was primarily related to higher earnings in both major businesses e p and r m 
the net costs of corporate activities were higher in and partially offset the improved results in e p and r m 
earnings in the e p business improved by million in as this business benefited from higher oil sales prices  lower exploration expenses and lower income taxes in compared to e p earnings were adversely affected in by lower sales volumes for oil and natural gas and slightly lower realized natural gas sales prices as well as higher expenses for production  depreciation  depletion and administration 
the r m business generated strong profits in  increasing million compared to the improvement was primarily due to higher us refining margins in compared to  a fully operational refinery at meraux  louisiana  during  and lower hurricane repair expenses in  but r m earnings in included an unfavorable impact from noncash inventory revaluations in the uk the meraux refinery was shut down for repairs for the first five months of following significant damage caused by hurricane katrina in late august the company incurred significant repair costs in at meraux following hurricane katrina  certain of which were not recoverable through insurance policies 
in the uk  the company acquired the remaining interest in the milford haven  wales  refinery in late under the company s last in  first out accounting policy for inventory  an after tax noncash charge of million was recorded in the year of acquisition to reduce the carrying value of crude oil and refined products inventory to beginning of year prices  which were significantly lower than at the end of the year 
the net costs of corporate activities increased by million in compared to  with the cost increase mostly attributable to higher net interest expense and higher losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
the higher net interest expense was caused by higher average borrowing levels  partially offset by a higher level of interest costs capitalized to e p development projects 
the us dollar generally weakened against other significant foreign currencies used in the company s business in  especially compared to the canadian dollar 
the period included lower corporate administrative costs mostly due to higher expense in for an educational assistance contribution commitment 
sales and other operating revenues were billion higher in than in mostly due to higher sales volumes and sales prices for gasoline and other refined products  higher sales prices for crude oil produced by the company  and higher sales volumes for merchandise at retail gasoline stations 
sales volumes for oil and natural gas were lower in than in gain loss on sales of assets in was million unfavorable to as the company had no major asset sales in interest and other income was lower by million in 
table of contents due mostly to higher losses on foreign currency exchange attributable to a weakening of the us dollar against the primary foreign currencies affecting the company s operations  which mainly include the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling 
crude oil and product purchases expense increased by billion in compared to due to a combination of higher purchase prices and throughput volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks at the company s refineries  higher prices and volumes of refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations  and higher levels of merchandise purchased for sale at the gasoline stations 
the higher crude oil purchase volumes in were caused by the meraux refinery being operational throughout following about five months of downtime for hurricane related repairs in operating expenses increased by million in compared to and included higher refinery and retail station costs  higher workover and repair costs for gulf of mexico oil and gas fields  and higher costs for oil field operations in malaysia  the uk and ecuador and for canadian synthetic oil operations at syncrude 
exploration expenses were million lower in than in primarily associated with less dry hole and geophysical expenses in malaysia  but partially offset by higher costs in canada for dry holes  geophysical  lease amortization and settlement of two work commitments on leases formerly held in the scotian shelf 
selling and general expenses were million higher in than in as higher compensation  insurance and berkana energy administrative costs in were almost offset by lower costs associated with an educational assistance program called the el dorado promise 
the company acquired of berkana energy in december  and subsequently sold this investment in january depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million higher in compared to due mostly to higher barrel equivalent unit rates for depreciation for virtually all e p segments and higher depreciation for the meraux refinery and retail gasoline stations 
impairment of long lived assets of million in primarily related to closing underperforming gasoline stations in the us and canada 
accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by million in mostly due to additional abandonment obligations incurred as kikeh development wells were drilled during the year  and higher anticipated future abandonment costs on existing wells in the us net costs associated with hurricanes was lower in by million mostly due to uninsured repair costs incurred in at the meraux refinery following hurricane katrina in the million of hurricane expense recorded in related to a downward adjustment of anticipated insurance recoveries at the meraux refinery based on updated projected loss limits announced by the company s primary property insurer 
interest expense increased by million in mostly associated with higher average debt levels during the year compared to the amount of interest costs capitalized to property  plant and equipment increased by million in due to higher spending on e p development projects in malaysia  the us and the republic of the congo 
minority interest in operations of berkana energy in canada was favorable million in compared to income tax expense was million higher in than in and was mainly attributable to higher pretax income levels 
the effective income tax rate for consolidated earnings rose from in to in the tax rate in both years was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to a combination of us state income taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceed the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because the ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years is uncertain 
the tax rates in both years benefitted  however  from overall favorable effects of tax rate changes in foreign countries 
segment results in the following table  the company s results of operations for the three years ended december  are presented by segment 
more detailed reviews of operating results for the company s exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table 
millions of dollars exploration and production united states canada united kingdom malaysia ecuador other refining and marketing north america united kingdom corporate and other net income exploration and production earnings from exploration and production operations were billion in  million in and million in e p earnings improved million in compared to with the significant increase primarily due to higher average realized sales prices for the company s oil and natural gas production  higher crude oil production volumes and gains on disposals of canadian assets 
results in were favorably impacted by income tax benefits associated with tax rate reductions in canada 
the results were unfavorably affected compared to by lower natural gas sales volumes and higher expenses for exploration  production  depreciation  depletion  administration and accretion of discounted abandonment liabilities 
crude oil sales volumes in were higher than in  compared with a increase in crude oil production in compared to crude oil sales volumes grew more than 
table of contents production in due to the timing of sale transactions as the company had a lower inventory of unsold crude oil at year end compared to a year earlier 
the significant unsold crude oil inventory at year end was mostly at kikeh where sales volumes lagged production in late during the start up phase of this field 
during  higher oil sales volumes in malaysia attributable to higher production volumes at the kikeh field were partially offset by lower oil sales volumes at most other producing areas 
lower us crude oil sales volumes in were primarily due to reduced production volumes at several gulf of mexico fields following hurricanes gustav and ike 
certain facilities owned by other companies downstream of our producing fields were down for repairs for an extended period of time in the fourth quarter lower oil sales volumes in canada were attributable to field decline at hibernia  field decline and a higher royalty rate at terra nova  sale of the lloydminster heavy oil property in western canada and more downtime at syncrude 
lower crude oil sales volumes in the uk  ecuador and west patricia  offshore sarawak malaysia  were mostly caused by production declines as these fields mature 
natural gas sales volumes were lower in than and the reduction was mostly due to sale of berkana energy in january additionally  several of the company s gulf of mexico fields were either shut in or had curtailed gas production while downstream facilities owned by others were repaired following third quarter hurricanes 
the company s average realized oil sales price was higher in than  and the average north american natural gas sales price was higher in e p earnings improved million in compared to primarily due to higher average realized oil sales prices in the latter year for the company s production 
in addition  exploration expenses were lower by million in both years were favorably affected by income tax benefits associated with tax rate reductions in foreign countries 
the results were unfavorably impacted compared to by lower oil and natural gas sales volumes  lower realized natural gas sales prices in north america and higher expenses for production  depreciation  depletion  administration and accretion of discounted abandonment liabilities 
crude oil sales volumes in were lower than in  despite a increase in crude oil production in compared to the lower sales volumes were caused by the timing of sale transactions as the company had a larger inventory of unsold crude oil at year end compared to a year earlier 
the increase in unsold crude oil inventory  which was primarily at the kikeh field in malaysia  returned to normal levels during during  lower oil sales volumes in the us and ecuador were only partially offset by higher oil sales volumes in malaysia and canada 
the lower sales volumes in the us were due to field declines in the gulf of mexico  while lower sales volumes in ecuador were caused by nonrecurring make up sales volumes in that related to a prior year 
higher oil sales volumes in malaysia were mostly caused by start up of the significant kikeh field  offshore sabah  in august  partially offset by lower production at the west patricia field  offshore sarawak 
higher volumes in canada were attributable to better production volumes at the terra nova field in the jeanne d arc basin  offshore newfoundland  which was shut in for repairs for about six months in natural gas sales volumes were lower in than and the reduction was mostly due to field declines for maturing fields in the gulf of mexico and onshore south louisiana as well as lower natural gas production at uk north sea fields 
the company s average realized oil sales price was higher in than  while north american natural gas sales prices averaged less in than in the results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages f and f of this form k report 
average daily production and sales rates and weighted average sales prices are shown on page of the annual report 
a summary of oil and gas revenues  including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  is presented in the following table 
millions of dollars united states oil and gas liquids natural gas canada conventional oil and gas liquids natural gas synthetic oil united kingdom oil and gas liquids natural gas malaysia oil and gas liquids natural gas ecuador crude oil total oil and gas revenues the company s crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids production averaged  barrels per day in   barrels per day in and  barrels per day in production of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids in increased by  barrels per day  or compared to  primarily due to continued ramp up of the kikeh field in block k  offshore sabah  malaysia 
this prolific field  which came on production in august produced  net barrels of oil per day for the full year compared to  barrels per day 
table of contents in light oil production in canada declined from barrels per day in to barrels per day in due to sale of berkana energy in january heavy oil production in the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb fell from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  due to sale of the lloydminster property in and lower production volumes at the seal field in alberta 
oil production at hibernia  offshore newfoundland  was  barrels per day in  up slightly from  barrels per day in oil production decreased at terra nova  offshore newfoundland  from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in the reduction at terra nova was attributable to natural field decline plus a higher royalty rate 
syncrude production totaled  barrels per day in compared to  barrels per day in  with the decline caused by more downtime for repairs and maintenance in the current year 
oil production declined in the us from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in the reduction was primarily at gulf of mexico fields where production was curtailed while awaiting repairs to downstream facilities owned by other companies that were damaged by third quarter hurricanes 
oil production in the uk was down from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  with the reduction caused by declining production at the company s primary fields in the north sea 
the west patricia field  offshore sarawak malaysia  had net production of  barrels per day in after production levels of  barrels per day in west patricia experienced declining production and a smaller portion of production was allocated to the company s account under the production sharing contract 
oil production totaled  barrels per day in ecuador in  compared to  barrels per day in due to a shut down of the block development drilling program during following an arbitrary decision by the government to impose a revenue sharing provision starting in late on all sales prices exceeding a benchmark price that averaged about per barrel during the year 
production of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids in increased by  barrels per day  or compared to  primarily due to start up in august of the kikeh field in block k  offshore sabah  malaysia 
this prolific field came on production only five years after discovery 
kikeh produced  barrels of oil per day for the full year oil production also increased in at terra nova  offshore eastern canada  at syncrude in alberta  and in ecuador 
oil volumes declined in at most other areas  including the us and at hibernia  west patricia  the uk north sea and the wcsb 
terra nova produced throughout after being off line for major equipment repairs for six months in total production at terra nova was  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in syncrude production totaled  barrels per day in compared to  barrels per day in the production increase at syncrude was mostly attributable to a third coker unit that started up during oil production totaled  barrels per day in ecuador  up barrels per day due to a more significant development drilling campaign in block in oil production declined in the us from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in the reduction was due to declines at various maturing fields in the gulf of mexico 
heavy oil production in the wcsb fell from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  primarily due to a slower development drilling program for non operated fields in alberta 
oil production at hibernia  offshore newfoundland  was  barrels per day in down from  barrels per day in as the field experienced production decline during the year 
oil production in the uk was down from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  with the reduction caused by declining production at the company s primary fields in the north sea 
the west patricia field  offshore sarawak malaysia  had net production of  barrels per day in after production levels of  barrels per day in west patricia experienced declining production along with an increased government take under the production sharing contract 
worldwide sales of natural gas were million cubic feet mmcf per day in  million in and million in natural gas sales volumes in the united states increased in and averaged mmcf per day 
the increase of mmcf per day in would have been significantly higher but for the reduced gas production associated with hurricane damage to downstream facilities late in the year 
natural gas sales volumes in canada averaged mmcf per day in  lower than in january  the company sold berkana energy  formerly its largest gas producing asset in canada 
natural gas sales volumes in the uk were up in and averaged mmcf per day 
the uk gas sales volumes were mostly attributable to more gas volumes sold at the mungo and monan fields in the north sea 
natural gas production commenced from the kikeh field offshore sabah malaysia in december and sales volumes averaged mmcf per day for the year 
natural gas sales volumes in the united states fell in and averaged mmcf per day 
the decline of mmcf per day in was due to declines at various fields in the deepwater gulf of mexico and onshore south louisiana 
natural gas sales volumes in increased in canada and averaged mmcf per day 
natural gas sales volumes in the uk fell in and averaged mmcf per day 
the lower uk gas sales volumes were attributable to lower associated gas volumes sold from two oil fields in the north sea 
the company s average worldwide realized crude oil  condensate and gas liquids sales price was per barrel in compared to per barrel in this was an increase of in oil prices began to plummet in the second half of and continued to display weakness in early as west texas intermediate crude oil prices averaged about per barrel in january in the us  the company realized an average price of per barrel in  up from the average sales price in for heavy oil produced in canada was per barrel  higher than in hibernia and terra nova sales prices averaged and per barrel  respectively  during  which were increases of and 
synthetic oil production sold for per barrel  up from a year earlier 
uk oil prices increased to per barrel in in malaysia  oil produced at the kikeh field sold for less in than in  with an average of per barrel for the just completed year 
kikeh came on stream in august and all sales during that year occurred in the fourth quarter when prices were at the strongest point during at the west patricia field offshore sarawak the average sales price of per barrel was above the average price 
the average realized sales price after revenue sharing with the ecuadorian government for block oil was per barrel  a decrease of from during  the government required a share of block realized sales 
table of contents prices that exceeded a benchmark price that escalates with the monthly us consumer price index 
this government revenue sharing increased from above the benchmark price to in october at year end  the benchmark oil price for block was approximately per barrel 
the company and its partners in block have initiated arbitration proceedings claiming that the government does not have the right under the contract to change this sharing arrangement 
the company is unable to predict when the arbitration proceedings will be concluded 
the company and its partners stopped paying the revenue share above the benchmark price to the government in mid the company has recorded a liability of approximately million for unpaid revenue share with the government at year end the company s average realized oil sales price was per barrel in  up from the average of per barrel 
in the us  the company realized an average price of per barrel in  up from the average sales price for canadian heavy oil production was per barrel  higher than in hibernia and terra nova sales prices averaged and per barrel  respectively  during  which were increases of and 
synthetic oil production sold for per barrel in  up from a year earlier 
uk oil prices increased to per barrel in in malaysia  oil produced at the west patricia field sold for more in than in  with an average of for the year 
the kikeh field came on stream in august and all sales from this field occurred in the stronger price environment during the fourth quarter at an average of per barrel 
the average realized sales price after revenue sharing with the ecuadorian government for block oil was per barrel  an increase of from for most of the year  the government received a share of realized sales prices that exceeded a benchmark price that escalates with the monthly us consumer price index 
however  in mid october the government changed its share of such revenue from to 
at year end  the benchmark oil price for block was approximately per barrel 
the company s natural gas sales prices rose in compared to the company s average realized north american natural gas sales prices increased by in to per thousand cubic feet mcf 
in the uk  the average natural gas price rose to per mcf 
the company s average realized north american natural gas sales prices fell in to per mcf 
in the uk  the average natural gas price rose to per mcf 
based on sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each per barrel and per mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production operations by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the company s refining and marketing segments could be affected differently 
production expenses were million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
costs per equivalent barrel during the last three years are shown in the following table 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil united kingdom malaysia ecuador worldwide excluding synthetic oil production cost per equivalent barrel decreased in the us in compared to due to lower costs incurred for workovers and repairs at fields in the gulf of mexico 
us per barrel equivalent costs were higher in versus mostly due to higher workover and field repairs and lower production volumes 
the per unit costs for canadian conventional oil and gas operations  excluding syncrude  were higher in than mostly due to lower production levels 
the cost for conventional oil in canada was lower in than primarily due to higher production levels and lower repair costs at terra nova in terra nova was shut in for major repairs for six months in higher production costs per barrel for canadian synthetic oil operations in were due to additional costs for fuel and repairs and lower production levels 
the increased syncrude cost in was primarily due to a higher net profit royalty rate and a higher foreign exchange rate 
the average cost per barrel in the uk in versus was caused by lower overall production levels and higher repair costs 
the higher average uk cost per barrel in was mostly due to higher maintenance costs  lower oil production at the north sea fields and a higher foreign exchange rate 
the lower average cost per barrel in malaysia in compared to was attributable to higher production at kikeh where unit costs per equivalent barrel are lower than at west patricia 
the higher per unit cost in malaysia in was due to the start up phase for kikeh oil and a lower production level for west patricia compared to higher per unit operating costs in ecuador in compared to were mostly attributable to lower production levels in the most recent year 
higher per unit operating costs in ecuador in were primarily caused by additional water handling costs as block wells mature 

table of contents exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f on this form k report 
certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars dry holes geological and geophysical other undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses dry hole expense was million more in than in and was attributable to more exploration drilling capital expenditures in with mostly new e p management in  much of that year was spent reevaluating the company s worldwide exploration drilling prospects 
the higher costs for dry holes in was mostly in the offshore waters of malaysia and western australia 
dry holes expense was million less in than primarily due to a lower level of exploration drilling activity in geological and geophysical g g expenses were million higher in mostly due to a d seismic program at block  offshore suriname  and more seismic activities in the tupper area in british columbia 
g g expenses were million less in than primarily due to lower spending in malaysia for d seismic for blocks sk and h and lower geophysical analyses on pm blocks the lower malaysian costs were partially offset by higher seismic costs in in the gulf of mexico and offshore australia  and higher geophysical studies offshore the republic of the congo 
other exploration expenses in were million lower than mostly due to a million settlement in for unfulfilled work commitments on two expiring scotian shelf leases  offshore eastern canada 
other exploration expenses in were million higher than in also due to the scotian shelf work commitment settlement 
undeveloped leasehold amortization expense rose million in compared to  after an increase of million in compared to  primarily due to amortization of undeveloped land acquisition costs at the tupper property in northeast british columbia  where the company has aggressively added undeveloped acreage over the last two years 
a million charge in the exploration and production business for asset impairment in related to write down of an unused e p administrative office to estimated fair value 
expense of million was incurred in in the company s exploration and production operations for uninsured costs to repair damages and to recognize associated higher insurance costs caused by hurricanes katrina and rita in the gulf of mexico 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense related to exploration and production operations totaled million in  million in and million in the increase of million in expense compared to was mostly caused by a much higher production level at the kikeh field  offshore sabah  malaysia 
the million increase in compared to was caused by generally higher per unit rates for development capital  the start up of the kikeh field  and an increase in foreign exchange rates in canada and the uk the company continues to experience high drilling and related costs caused by a strong demand for such services 
the exploration and production business recorded expenses of million in  million in and million in for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities 
because the abandonment liability is carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value  accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment 
the increase in accretion costs in was associated with higher estimated abandonment costs at syncrude and additional development wells drilled at the kikeh field 
the higher accretion costs in were mostly related to higher estimated future abandonment costs for facilities and wells in the gulf of mexico and future abandonment obligations related to kikeh development wells drilled in the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was in  in and in the effective tax rate was higher in than the previous two years as both and included net tax benefits from enacted changes in foreign tax rates 
canada lowered federal tax rates in both and  and in the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan also reduced tax rates 
the net benefit from these canadian tax rate reductions  which effectively reduced recorded deferred tax liabilities was million in and million in the effective tax rate exceeded the us statutory tax rate due to higher overall foreign tax rates and exploration activities in areas where current tax relief is not available 
the effective tax rate in was slightly below the us statutory tax rate of primarily due to the enacted canadian federal tax rate reduction during the year 
the effective tax rate was lower than in mostly due to a deferred tax expense in related to a increase in uk tax rates on oil and gas profits 
a million us tax benefit was realized in for a charitable building donation 
also in  the company incurred lower exploration and other expenses in tax jurisdictions where tax relief is currently not available 
tax jurisdictions with no current tax benefit on expenses primarily include non revenue generating areas in malaysia  the republic of the congo  suriname  australia and indonesia 
each main exploration area in malaysia is currently considered a distinct taxable entity and expenses in certain areas may not be used to offset revenues generated in other areas 
no tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for blocks h  p  l and m  offshore sabah  and blocks pm  offshore peninsula malaysia 
the effective tax rate was only slightly higher than the us statutory tax rate of due to net overall benefits from the aforementioned tax rate changes in canada and the uk in that year 

table of contents at december   approximately of the company s us proved oil reserves and of the us proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped 
virtually all of the total us undeveloped reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis are associated with the company s various deepwater gulf of mexico fields 
further drilling  facility construction and well workovers are required to move undeveloped reserves to developed 
in block k malaysia  of oil reserves of million barrels and of natural gas reserves of billion cubic feet at year end for the kikeh field are undeveloped pending completion of facilities and continued development drilling  and of the million barrels of oil reserves at the kakap field are undeveloped pending completion of drilling operations directed by another company 
also in malaysia  there were billion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves at various fields offshore sarawak at year end  which were held under this category pending completion of development drilling and facilities 
first gas production at the kikeh field occurred in december and is scheduled for the sarawak gas fields in the third quarter on a worldwide basis  the company spent approximately million in  million in and million in to develop proved reserves

refining and marketing the company s refining and marketing r m operations generated record earnings of million in  after earning million in and million in the improvement in earnings compared to was caused by favorable uk refining profits following the acquisition of the remaining of the milford haven refinery in december  and nonrecurring charges in for a last in  first out lifo inventory writedown in the uk and retail gasoline station impairments in north america 
the improvement in r m earnings in compared to was due to stronger refining margins in the us  lower hurricane related expenses in  and a fully operational meraux refinery which was shut down for repairs for about five months in following hurricane katrina 
total hurricane expenses after taxes in r m operations were million in and million in the meraux  louisiana refinery significantly increased crude oil throughputs in compared to as the earlier year was unfavorably affected by downtime for repairs 
r m earnings in were net of two significant charges a million after tax charge related to closure of gasoline stations in the us and canada  and an after tax inventory charge of million in the uk the company s north american r m operations generated earnings of million in  million in and million in north american operations include refining activities in the united states and marketing activities in the united states and canada 
north american r m earnings were down slightly in compared to as lower profits generated by the us refining operations were not quite offset by much stronger retail marketing profits in demand for gasoline declined in the us in due to higher costs and a weakening economy 
this lower demand led to much tighter crack spreads for us refineries in compared to crack spreads represent the uplift of gasoline and distillate prices over the cost of crude oil feedstocks 
both us refineries were temporarily shut down for turnaround activities during the and operating results for the company s north american refining business were negatively impacted by hurricane related costs and below optimal meraux refinery crude throughput volumes as a result of hurricane katrina 
uninsured damages  higher insurance premiums  settlement of the class action oil spill litigation and other hurricane related pretax costs in the company s north american operations were million in and million in the hurricane expense in was caused by a downward adjustment of expected insurance recoveries based on an updated loss limit published by the company s primary insurer 
the meraux refinery throughput volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks averaged  barrels per day in   barrels per day in and  barrels per day in significant flooding and wind damage associated with hurricane katrina resulted in the refinery being shut down from late august through may during the refinery s nine months of downtime for repairs  major upgrades and improvements were completed  and turnarounds on the refinery s hydrocracker and fluid catalytic cracking unit debutanizer were performed 
the company s refinery in superior  wisconsin also generated weaker earnings in than in as a result of tighter crack spreads in the later year 
north american retail gasoline station operations had improved results in compared to as this business enjoyed higher per gallon margins  higher sales volumes and lower store closure costs compared to the prior year 
this operation s business model of always offering competitive fuel prices usually leads to increased sales volumes during periods of high gasoline prices such as in the first nine months of the operating results for the company s north american retail gasoline stations were lower in compared to as underperforming stores were closed during  including in the us and all eight stations in canada 
the company recorded impairment expense of million in associated with these store closures 
excluding this impairment charge  the operating results for this business would have been essentially flat with a total of retail stations were added in the us during  including in the parking lots of walmart supercenters and at other stand alone locations 
average fuel sales volumes per station increased again in  the th straight year of improvements 
unit margins sales realization less costs of crude and other feedstocks  transportation to point of sale and refinery operating and depreciation expenses averaged per barrel in north america in  in and in north american refined product sales volumes increased to a record  barrels per day in  following a increase to  barrels per day in the company s us retail gasoline stations continued to increase per site fuel sales volumes with a increase in the average monthly fuel sales volume per station in following a increase in operations in the united kingdom had earnings of million in compared to a loss of million in and earnings of million in on december   the company acquired of the milford haven  wales refinery  after having a interest in the asset prior to that date 
the improved earnings in compared to were mostly related to profits generated by the milford haven refinery as the refinery generated stronger margins in and the period included a significant inventory charge 
in association with the late milford haven acquisition  the company built a significant additional layer of crude oil and refined products inventory 
the period included 
table of contents a million after tax non cash charge to reduce the carrying value of these higher inventory levels to early prices 
under the company s lifo inventory accounting policy  inventory volume increases are priced at the first purchase prices during the year  and the prices of crude oil and refined products were at a much lower level in early compared to the price at the time these products were acquired near year end the lifo inventory charge reduced the average carrying value for these additional inventories in the uk by approximately per barrel 
excluding this non cash inventory charge  the operating result for the company s uk operations was slightly improved over in late  the company purchased six existing fuel stations and leased an additional stations in england and scotland 
unit margins in the united kingdom averaged per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in overall sales of refined products in the uk increased more than in  following an increase of in the sales increase was attributable to additional quantities of refined products produced and sold throughout at the milford haven refinery following the company s acquisition of the remaining interest in december corporate the after tax costs of corporate activities  which include interest income  interest expense  foreign exchange gains and losses  and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions  were million in  million in and million in the net cost of corporate activities increased million in compared to primarily due to higher costs associated with foreign exchange where transactions are denominated in currencies other than the operation s functional currency 
additionally interest costs  net of amounts capitalized to development projects  and administrative costs were also higher in than in the after tax costs of foreign currency exchange amounted to million in compared to costs of million in the additional costs were primarily related to us dollar transactions within the us s sterling functional downstream operations  as these dollar transactions expanded significantly with the addition of milford haven  wales refinery ownership beginning in december at year end the us dollar had strengthened against the british pound sterling  against the euro  and against the canadian dollar compared to the end of net interest expense increased million in compared to mostly due to lower amounts of interest capitalized to ongoing oil and gas development projects during the just completed year 
administrative expenses in the corporate area increased in primarily due to higher total compensation expense and higher contributions to community and educational programs in the current year 
interest income increased million in versus and was mostly associated with higher average short term invested funds in canada and the uk income taxes in were million favorable to  and were primarily related to benefits on the higher foreign exchange losses and higher net interest expense as discussed above 
net corporate costs increased million in compared to due primarily to higher net interest expense and higher losses on foreign exchange 
these higher costs were partially offset by lower costs in associated with an educational assistance commitment 
net interest expense rose by million in compared to due to interest associated with higher average outstanding long term debt balances 
the company s borrowings increased due to higher capital spending on oil and natural gas development projects in malaysia  the republic of the congo and canada  and in the downstream business related to capital spending for the purchase of the milford haven  wales refinery and land underlying most gasoline stations at walmart sites 
the amount of interest capitalized to development projects increased in in association with higher capital development spending 
the after tax effect of foreign exchange was a charge of million in compared to a charge of million in the us dollar weakened in by against the canadian dollar  against the euro and against the british pound sterling 
administrative expenses in in the corporate area were million less than due mostly to lower costs associated with the el dorado promise educational assistance contribution  but partially offset by higher compensation costs in the current year 
the el dorado promise involves the company s commitment to contribute million per year through to pay for post secondary tuition for eligible graduates of el dorado high school in arkansas 
income taxes were unfavorable in the corporate area in compared to due to a higher portion of interest and administrative expenses allocable to foreign operations without current tax relief

table of contents environmental matters murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations dealing with the environment 
compliance with existing and anticipated environmental regulations affects our overall cost of business 
areas affected include capital costs to construct  maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities  in concert with ongoing operating costs for environmental compliance 
anticipated and existing regulations affect our capital expenditures and earnings  and they may affect our competitive position to the extent that regulatory requirements with respect to a particular production technology may give rise to costs that our competitors might not bear 
environmental regulations have historically been subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities  and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of such regulations on our operations 
violation of federal or state environmental laws  regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and construction bans or delays 
a discharge of hazardous substances into the environment could  to the extent such event is not insured  subject us to substantial expense  including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations and claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for any personal injury and property damage that might result 
the most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting our us operations are the us clean air act  which regulates air emissions the us clean water act  which regulates discharges into us waters the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases the us federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which regulates the handling and disposal of solid wastes the us federal oil pollution act of opa  which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the united states the u 
s safe drinking water act  which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground wells regulations of the us department of the interior governing offshore oil and gas operations 
these laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of air  water and solid waste discharges 
they also generally require permits for new or modified operations 
many states and foreign countries where the company operates also have or are developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water as well as the characteristics and composition of refined products  which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements 
we are also subject to certain acts and regulations  including legal and administrative proceedings  governing remediation of wastes or oil spills from current and past operations  which include but may not be limited to leaks from pipelines  underground storage tanks and general environmental operations 
cercla commonly referred to as the superfund act  and comparable state statutes primarily address historic contamination and impose joint and several liability upon potentially responsible parties prp  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
cleanup of contaminated sites is the responsibility of the owners and operators of the sites that released  disposed  or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
cercla also authorizes the us environmental protection agency epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible persons 
in the course of our ordinary operations  we generate waste that falls within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
we may be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been disposed of or released into the environment 
cercla also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous or extremely hazardous and must be reported to the national response center  if they exceed an epa established reportable quantity 
the epa currently considers us to be a prp at two superfund sites 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
however  based on current negotiations and available information  we believe that we are a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at these superfund sites 
we have not recorded a liability for remedial costs on superfund sites 
we could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at these sites or other superfund sites 
we believe that our share of the ultimate costs to clean up the superfund sites will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on murphy s net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
we currently own or lease  and have in the past owned or leased  properties at which hazardous substances have been or are being handled 
although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control 
these properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under such laws we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
while some of these historical properties are in various stages of negotiation  investigation  and or cleanup  we are investigating the extent of any such liability and the availability of applicable defenses and believe costs related to these sites will not have a material adverse affect on murphy s net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 

table of contents rcra and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of solid wastes  with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment  storage or disposal of hazardous wastes 
we generate non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of rcra and comparable state statutes 
our operating sites also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
the types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories spent catalysts usually hydro treating catalysts  spent used filter media  tank bottoms and api separator sludge  contaminated soils  laboratory and maintenance spent solvents  and industrial debris 
the costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
however  it is possible that additional wastes  which could include wastes currently generated during operations  will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes 
hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes 
such changes in the regulations could result in additional capital expenditures and operating expenses 
murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations  and such capital expenditures were million in and are projected to be million in our liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites 
although regulatory authorities may require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes  the cost of such potential alternative processes is not expected to exceed the accrued liability by a material amount 
certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by us from other sources  primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states 
since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur  we have not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries as of december  we are also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in our operations 
under our accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
under opa  owners and operators of tankers  owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the united states 
to the best of our knowledge  there has been no such opa claims made against murphy 
the epa has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels  primarily related to the level of sulfur found in highway diesel and gasoline  which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel is used 
several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels 
the epa s mandated requirements for low sulfur gasoline are effective in and both of our us refineries have been expanded and are now capable of producing the required low sulfur gasoline 
each of the us refineries must begin to produce the epa required ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd beginning in the meraux refinery is currently capable of producing this ulsd for approximately half of its diesel production  but the superior refinery is not yet capable of meeting the ulsd standard 
our management is currently studying alternatives available for fully meeting this ulsd standard at meraux and superior 
the energy independence and security act eisa was signed into law in december the eis act through epa regulation requires refiners and gasoline blenders to obtain renewable fuel volume or representative trading credits as a percentage of their finished product production 
this act greatly increases the renewable fuels obligation defined in the renewable fuels standard which began in september murphy is actively blending renewable fuel volumes through its retail and wholesale operations and trading corresponding credits known as renewable identification numbers rins to meet its obligation 
the federal water pollution control act of fwpca imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters 
the fwpca imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation and damages 
we maintain wastewater discharge permits for our facilities where they are required pursuant to the fwpca and comparable state laws 
we have also applied for all necessary permits to discharge storm water under such laws 
we believe that compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
our us operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state and local statutes 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these statutes in all states in which we operate 
amendments to the federal clean air act enacted in late require or will require most refining operations in the us to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the epa and state environmental agencies 
under the epa s clean air act authority  the national petroleum refinery npr initiative global consent decree was initiated as a national priority to investigate four marquee compliance areas for refinery operations i new source review prevention of significant deterioration for fluidized catalytic cracking units  heaters and boilers  ii new source performance standards for flares  sulfur recovery units  fuel gas combustion devices including heaters and boilers  iii leak detection and repair requirements  and iv benzene national emissions 
table of contents standards for hazardous air pollutants 
murphy  in began negotiations with the epa  which were interrupted by the events of hurricane katrina 
both the state of louisiana and wisconsin are parties to the npr 
negotiations with epa resumed in and are continuing 
while substantial progress has been made in these negotiations  the company is unable at this time to predict the capital costs  operating costs and potential fines or penalties that may occur in the future upon conclusion of the npr negotiations 
our meraux  louisiana refinery is also currently negotiating with the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq regarding three compliance order notice of proposed penalty co nopp notifications regarding air and water discharges 
while we are in various stages of negotiations and or settlement  the company is unable to predict the costs that it will incur related to these co nopp negotiations 
world leaders have held numerous discussions about the level of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions 
as part of these discussions  the kyoto agreement was adopted in and was ratified by certain countries in which we operate or may operate in the future  with the united states being the primary country that has yet to ratify the agreement 
the agreement became effective for ratifying countries in and these countries have implemented regulations or are in various stages of developing regulations to address its contents that ultimately target a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
we are unable to predict how us regulations if any associated with the kyoto agreement will impact costs in future years 
the european union has adopted an emissions trading scheme in response to the kyoto agreement in order to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
our refining operations at milford haven currently have the most exposure to these requirements and may require purchase of emission allowances to maintain compliance with environmental permit requirements 
these environmental expenditures are expensed as incurred 
currently  various national and international legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxides are in various phases of discussion or implementation 
these include proposed us federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs  each of which have imposed or would impose mandatory reporting and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
these actions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities  ii install new emission controls on our facilities  and iii administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions program 
these actions could also impact the consumption of refined products  thereby affecting our refinery operations 
the company is unable to predict at this time how much the cost of compliance with any future us legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions  if it occurs  will be in future periods 
proactively  murphy has instituted an internal climate change workgroup  conducts annual greenhouse gas inventories and participates in the massachusetts institute of technology mit joint program on the science and policy of global change 
safety matters we are also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 
in  osha announced a national emphasis program nep for inspecting all refineries in the us for compliance with osha s process safety management psm regulations 
osha completed an inspection of our superior  wisconsin refinery in february and issued several compliance related citations and a penalty of  as of december   all of the cited osha items have been abated 
other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
prices for oil field goods and services have generally risen with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant during the last few years primarily driven by high demand for such goods and services when oil and gas prices were strong 
as noted earlier  oil and natural gas prices have fallen significantly in late and early  however  the prices for oil goods and services have not generally declined in tandem with oil and gas prices 
should a lower price environment for oil and gas continue  the company anticipates that prices for certain equipment and services will decline due to falling demand for such items 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services

significant accounting policies in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires significant estimates 
the most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
sec rules require that year end oil and natural gas prices must be used for determining proved reserve quantities 
year end prices usually do not approximate the average price that the company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production 
the company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations 
estimated reserves are subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the company s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations 
the company s proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages f and f of the annual report 
an unfavorable us oil revision in resulted from updated reservoir modeling of one field in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
an unfavorable revision in canada in was related to low heavy oil prices at year end  but this was partially offset by a favorable impact from better field performance at hibernia 
a favorable oil reserve revision in malaysia was attributable to better than anticipated drilling results and additional drilling opportunities in the main reservoir at the kikeh field  coupled with better reservoir performance and artificial lift improvements at the west patricia field 
an unfavorable oil reserve revision in the us in was mostly related to poor performance at one deepwater field in the gulf of mexico 
favorable oil reserve revisions in in canada relate primarily to better performance at the hibernia and terra nova fields 
favorable oil revisions in malaysia relate to west patricia and kikeh well performances 
the oil reserve revisions in in the us  canada  malaysia and ecuador were based on performance of various local wells 
the favorable oil reserve revision in malaysia in was mostly due to extension of proved oil in the kikeh reservoir 
an unfavorable natural gas reserve revision in malaysia in was related to entitlement adjustments under the sarawak blocks sk and sk production sharing contract and gas volumes lost due to operational delays that restricted sales volumes at the kikeh field  offshore sabah 
downward revisions to us natural gas reserves in and were mostly caused by unfavorable production performance for gas wells at various fields in the gulf of mexico and onshore south louisiana 
the favorable natural gas reserve revision in canada in is mostly attributable to well performance at the natural gas field owned by a consolidated subsidiary 
the downward revision to natural gas reserves in malaysia is based on higher contractual sales prices at year end compared to the significant upward revision of natural gas reserves in malaysia in related to gas associated with the kikeh field that will be sold to the local government beginning in the company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
on december   the sec adopted revisions to oil and natural gas reserve reporting requirements which are effective for the company at year end  unless the timing is subsequently amended 
among other things  the rule revises the definition of proved reserves  including the pricing used to determine economic producibility  expands the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include non traditional and unconventional resources  which includes the company s synthetic oil operations in alberta  and allows  but does not require  companies to disclose probable and possible reserves in sec filings 
the company is currently evaluating these new rules and cannot predict how the new rules will affect its future reporting of oil and natural gas reserves 
the full rule is available at the sec s website at www

successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 

table of contents in some cases  a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves can not be made immediately 
this is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon s found 
the determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is  in turn  usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves 
under current accounting rules  the company holds well costs in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked  dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred 
dry hole expense related to wells drilled in a prior year was million in  there were no dry holes in or that were drilled in prior years 
impairment of long lived assets the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment and goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  future capital and abandonment costs  future margins on refined products produced and sold  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable reserve revisions  expected deterioration of future refining and or marketing margins for refined products  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a property s carrying value for possible impairment 
in making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment  the company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices  future production volumes  and future capital and operating costs 
due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets  the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the company s projections 
estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves 
although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  however  there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection 
the company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available 
the company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations 
although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable  at times  costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated 
in assessing potential impairment involving refining and marketing assets  the company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events  which include projections of future margins  future capital expenditures and future operating expenses 
future marketing or operating decisions  such as closing or selling certain assets  and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the company s conclusion about potential asset impairment 
based on an evaluation of expected future cash flows from properties at year end  the company does not believe it had any significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at that date 
the expected future sales prices for crude oil and natural gas used in the evaluation were based on quoted future prices for the respective production periods 
these quoted prices generally reflected higher expected prices for oil and natural gas in the future compared to the existing spot prices at the end of if quoted prices for future years had been lower  the smaller projected cash flows for properties could have led to significant impairment charges being recorded for certain properties in in addition  one or a combination of factors such as lower future sales prices  lower future production  higher future costs  lower future margins on refining and marketing sales  or the actions of government authorities could lead to impairment expenses in future periods 
based on these unknown future factors as described herein  the company can not predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future 
murphy holds a interest in block ecuador  where the company and its partners produce oil for export 
on october   the government of ecuador enacted into law a levy that increases from to its share of oil sales prices that exceed a threshold reference price that was about per barrel at december  the company and its partners in block have initiated arbitration proceedings with an international arbitrator as permitted by its participation contract 
while arbitration proceedings are ongoing the block partners are actively negotiating contractual changes with the ecuadorian government 
should the arbitration  negotiations and other designated security arrangements fail to permit the company to recover its investment  the company could have to record an impairment charge to reduce its investment in block in a future period 
the company s carrying value of fixed assets in ecuador amounted to million at december  income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and 
table of contents c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to basis differences for property  equipment and inventories  and dismantlements and retirement benefit plan liabilities 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
a valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for blocks h  pm  p  l and m in malaysia  exploration licenses in the republic of the congo and australia  and certain basis differences in the uk due to management s belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities  gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 
accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans murphy oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees 
the company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired us employees 
the expense associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries 
the most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
for the retiree medical and insurance plans  the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate 
discount rates are adjusted as necessary  generally based on the universe of high quality corporate bonds available within each country  and after cash flow analyses are performed to discount projected benefit payment streams 
expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics 
anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs 
based on bond yields at year end  the company has used a discount rate of in and beyond for the primary us plans 
although the company presently assumes a return on plan assets of for the primary us plan  it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions 
the smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current year s pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset valuations 
the company s normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses are expected to increase slightly in compared to based on the effects of a growing employee base 
in  the company paid million into various retirement plans and million into postretirement plans 
in  the company is expecting to fund payments of approximately million into various retirement plans and million for postretirement plans 
the retirement plan contribution includes a currently anticipated voluntary contribution of million 
the company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years 
future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines  the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed  or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected 
as described above  the company s retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions  primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets 
a decline in the discount rate would increase annual retirement and postretirement expenses by million and million  respectively  and a decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase retirement expense by million 
legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and other contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters  and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the company 
contractual obligations and guarantees the company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements  operating leases  purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments  and other long term liabilities 
in addition  the company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period 
total payments due after under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below 
amount of obligation millions of dollars total after total debt including current maturities operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total 
table of contents the company has entered into an agreement to lease production facilities for the kikeh field offshore malaysia 
in addition  the company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section 
the company s share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the table on the previous page 
in the normal course of its business  the company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the company fails to perform under those contracts 
the amount of commitments as of december  that expire in future periods is shown below 
amount of commitment millions of dollars total after financial guarantees letters of credit total material off balance sheet arrangements the company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes 
the most significant of these arrangements at year end includes an operating lease of the kikeh floating  production  storage and offloading vessel fpso  a natural gas transportation contract for the tupper area in british columbia and a hydrogen purchase contract for the meraux refinery 
the kikeh fpso lease calls for future monthly net lease payments over the next seven years 
the tupper transportation contract requires minimum monthly payments through the meraux refinery contract to purchase hydrogen ends in the hydrogen contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased 
future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown above 
outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
a strong global economy  which fueled demand for energy  led to generally stronger prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products during and the first half of beginning in the second half of and continuing into early  crude oil prices have fallen precipitously from the highs at mid year the decline in the prices for crude oil is primarily attributable to softening demand for energy associated with the worldwide economic downturn 
due to the weak prices for crude oil and north american natural gas prices  the company is making substantial efforts to balance its cash flow and spending in early the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to be below levels 
since the budget was approved by the company s board of directors  crude oil and north american natural gas prices have generally been below the levels assumed in the budget 
based on a recent review of capital expenditure projects  capital expenditures in are projected to total approximately billion 
of this amount  billion or about  is allocated for the exploration and production program 
geographically  e p capital is spread approximately as follows for the united states  for malaysia  for canada and for all other areas 
spending in the us is primarily associated with continued development of producing and nonproducing deepwater fields as well as for the company s gulf of mexico exploration program 
in malaysia  the majority of the spending is for continued development of natural gas fields in blocks sk and offshore sarawak where first production is anticipated in and the kakap field in block k 
the bulk of canadian spending in will relate to natural gas development at tupper in western canada 
spending in the republic of the congo includes continuing development costs for the azurite discovery offshore  which is scheduled to start production in mid refining and marketing expenditures in should be about million  including funds for construction of additional us retail gasoline stations and early costs for an expansion of the crude unit at the milford haven  wales refinery 
capital and other expenditures will be routinely reviewed during and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during the year 
capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases  which often are not anticipated at the time the budget is prepared 
the company will primarily fund its capital program in using operating cash flow  but will supplement funding where necessary using borrowings under available credit facilities 
the company will endeavor to have no increase in long term debt in  but a continued low price environment could reduce actual cash flow generated from operations to such a level that borrowings might be required during the year to maintain funding of the company s ongoing development projects 
as noted earlier  crude oil and north american natural gas prices in early were well below the levels assumed in the budget 
also  through early  margins within the company s refining and marketing operations were generally below amounts included in the company s budget 
the company currently expects production in to average about  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
a key assumption in projecting the level of company production is the anticipated ramp up of natural gas production from tupper in western canada and kikeh offshore sabah malaysia  and start up of natural gas production offshore sarawak malaysia 
in addition  continued reliability of production at significant fields such as kikeh  syncrude  hibernia and terra nova are necessary to achieve the anticipated production levels

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates  prices of crude oil  natural gas and petroleum products  and foreign currency exchange rates 
as described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
murphy was a party to short term derivative instruments at december  for a notional amount of approximately million barrels of oil that are intended to manage the price of certain superior  wisconsin refinery crude oil to be purchased in these contracts were marked to market at year end with a pretax charge of million 
a increase in the price of crude oil would have improved pretax income in by million  while a decrease in the price of crude oil would have reduced pretax income by million
