general description of our operations as of december   we operated dealerships in metropolitan markets throughout the united states 
we developed our dealership portfolio through the acquisition of large  locally branded dealership groups operating throughout the united states 
we complemented these large dealership groups with the purchase of numerous single point dealerships and small dealership groups in our existing market areas referred to in this annual report as tuck in acquisitions 
our retail network is currently organized into two regions  east and west  and includes nine locally branded dealership groups

table of contents new vehicle sales our franchises include a diverse portfolio of american  european and asian brands 
our new vehicle unit sales include the sale of new vehicles to individual retail customers new light vehicle retail  the sale of new vehicles to commercial customers fleet  and the sale of new heavy trucks heavy trucks the terms new light vehicle retail  fleet and heavy trucks  being collectively referred to as new 
our new light vehicle retail revenue and new light vehicle gross profit include revenue and gross profit from new light vehicle unit and fleet unit sales 
in  we sold  new vehicles through our dealerships 
new light vehicle retail sales were of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  new heavy truck revenue totaled of total revenue and of gross profit for the year ended december  we evaluate the results of our new vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on changes in consumer preferences as a result of our strong brand mix  which is heavily weighted towards mid line import and luxury brands 
please see business strategy focus on premier brand mix  strategic markets and diversification below for a discussion on our diverse offering of brands and products 
our new vehicle retail sales include new vehicle sales  new vehicle retail lease transactions provided by third parties and other similar agreements arranged by our individual dealerships 
as a result of finite lease terms  customers who lease new vehicles generally return to the market more frequently than customers who purchase new vehicles 
in addition  because third party lessors frequently give our dealerships the first option to purchase vehicles returned by customers at lease end  leases provide us with an additional source of late model vehicles for our used vehicle inventory 
generally  leased vehicles remain under factory warranty for the term of the lease  allowing dealerships to provide warranty repair service to the lessee throughout the lease term 
used vehicle sales we sell used vehicles at all of our dealership locations 
used vehicle sales include the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers used retail and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction wholesale the terms used retail and wholesale being collectively referred to as used 
in  we retailed  used vehicles through our dealerships 
retail sales of used vehicles  which generally have higher gross margins than new vehicles  made up approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  we evaluate the results of our used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold 
used vehicle revenue from wholesale sales was of total revenue for the year ended december  profits from the sales of used vehicles depend primarily on the ability of our dealerships to obtain a high quality supply of used vehicles and the use of the best available technology to manage our inventory 
our new vehicle operations provide our used vehicle operations with a large supply of high quality trade ins and off lease vehicles  which we believe are good sources of attractive used vehicle inventory 
we purchase a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory at auctions restricted to new vehicle dealers offering off lease  rental and fleet vehicles and open auctions that offer vehicles sold by other dealers and repossessed vehicles 
used vehicle inventory is typically wholesaled if they are not retailed within days  except for used vehicles that do not fit within our inventory mix  which are wholesaled almost immediately 
the reconditioning of used vehicles also creates profitable service work for our parts and service departments 
in addition to our high quality supply of used vehicles  we employ state of the art technology to manage our inventory on a local basis 
we transfer used vehicles among our dealerships to provide a balanced mix of used vehicle inventory at each of our dealerships 
we believe that acquisitions of additional dealerships expand the internal market for the transfer of used vehicles among our dealerships and  therefore  increase the ability of each dealership to offer a balanced mix of used vehicles 
we have taken several steps towards building customer confidence in our used vehicle inventory  including participation in manufacturer certification programs as well as the development of our own used vehicle certification program 
manufacturer programs make certain used vehicles eligible for vehicle benefits such as special finance rates and extended manufacturer warranties 
in addition  our internal used vehicle certification 
table of contents program includes a thorough inspection of used vehicle inventory within the program and allows our customers to return used vehicles for any reason within five days or five hundred miles  whichever occurs first 
we guarantee the operation of the vehicle  subject to certain limitations and state laws  for sixty days from the date of purchase 
in addition  we offer customers the opportunity to purchase extended warranties  which are provided by third parties 
over time  we intend to grow our used vehicle sales by maintaining high quality inventory across all price ranges and all classes of used vehicles  including factory certified as well as traditional non certified used vehicles providing competitive prices to our customers  executing our marketing initiatives  and increasing our focus on training our sales and service team 
parts and service we sell parts and provide maintenance and repair service at all of our franchised dealerships  primarily for the vehicle brands sold at those dealerships 
in addition  as of december   we maintained free standing collision repair centers either on the premises of  or in close proximity to  our dealerships 
we operate approximately  service bays 
parts and service accounted for approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  historically  parts and service revenues have been more stable than vehicle sales 
industry wide  parts and service revenues have consistently increased over time primarily due to the increased cost of maintaining vehicles  the added technical complexity of vehicles and the increased number of vehicles on the road 
we believe the variety and quality of parts and service offerings available for both new and used vehicles in recent years have seen progressive expansion and improvement 
our parts and service business benefits from the service work generated through the sale of extended service contracts to customers who purchase new and used vehicles from us because customers tend to service their vehicles at the same location where they purchase extended warranty contracts 
for the year ended december   warranty work accounted for of our parts and service revenue 
historically  the automotive repair industry has been highly fragmented 
we believe  however  that the increased use of advanced technology in vehicles has made it difficult for independent repair shops to have the expertise to perform major or technical repairs  especially as such repairs relate to luxury and mid line imports that comprise a significant majority of our new vehicle retail sales 
additionally  all manufacturers require manufacturer warranty work to be performed only at franchised dealerships 
as a result  unlike independent service stations or independent and superstore used car dealerships with service operations  our franchised dealerships are qualified to perform work covered by manufacturer warranties on increasingly technologically complex vehicles 
one of our major goals is to retain each vehicle purchaser as a long term customer of our parts and service departments 
therefore  we believe that significant opportunity for growth exists in our maintenance service business 
each dealership has systems in place to track customer maintenance records and to notify owners of vehicles purchased at the dealership when their vehicles are due for periodic services 
we have additional customer retention initiatives in place and have expanded our service offerings over the last few years to essentially make the parts and service business at our stores a one stop shop 
service and repair activities are an integral part of our overall approach to customer service 
from selling tires to utilizing state of the art diagnostic equipment  our parts and service business offers our customers all the services needed to maintain their vehicles 
in order to improve the profitability of our parts and service business  we continue to recruit technicians and other employees to our service centers to ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service 
over 
table of contents time  we maintained growth in this line of our business due to our attention to customer retention initiatives and our continued investment in human capital in past years 
we continue to train our staff  including service advisors  on menu selling and customer service skills 
we have also added business development centers in some of our stores to drive customer retention 
at these business development centers  we have staff dedicated to maintaining periodic contact with our customers 
furthermore  we have continued to add equipment to our service centers that help our technicians identify issues with our customers vehicles and promote incremental service sales 
we expect to improve our parts and service profitability by i maximizing the use of our service capacity  ii upgrading equipment  where appropriate  iii capitalizing on our regional training programs  and iv continuing to develop long term customer relationships 
finance and insurance we refer to the finance and insurance area of our business as f i 
through our f i business  we arrange for third party financing of the sale or lease of new and used vehicles to customers  as well as offer a number of insurance and warranty products such as extended service contracts  guaranteed asset protection gap insurance  prepaid maintenance  credit life and disability insurance  and similar products 
our finance and insurance business generated approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  we arranged customer financing on approximately of the vehicles we sold during the year ended december  these transactions resulted in commissions being paid to us by the third party lenders  including manufacturer captive finance subsidiaries 
as a general matter  we do not retain liability for the credit risk associated with these purchase and lease transactions after the completion of the transactions 
however  we may be required to repay the finance company certain commissions if a customer prepays or defaults on the retail installment sales contract  typically during a specified time period following the sale 
similarly  we may be required to refund a portion of our profit relating to the sale of warranty  maintenance and insurance products in the event of early cancellation 
we do not  however  bear any risk related to insurance payments  which are borne by third parties 
we receive favorable pricing on many of the warranty  maintenance and insurance products that we provide as a result of our size and sales volume 
we earn sales based commissions on substantially all of these products and may be charged back chargebacks for these commissions in the event a finance contract is cancelled  typically within the first days or if a non finance contract is canceled prior to its maturity 
we are currently party to a number of preferred lender agreements 
under the terms of the preferred lender agreements  each lender has agreed to provide a marketing fee to us above the standard commission for each loan that our dealerships place with that lender 
furthermore  many of the warranty and insurance products we sell result in underwriting profits and investment income based on portfolio performance 
recent developments on march   we announced that  as part of our continuous restructuring and cost reduction efforts  we are eliminating our regional management structure 
in connection with this further evolution of our company  michael s 
kearney  former president and ceo of our east region  has been named senior vice president and chief operating officer  responsible for the oversight of our dealership operations 
our independent public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its audit report for our financial statements that indicated there is uncertainty that we will remain in compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements  and that this uncertainty raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the inclusion of this explanatory paragraph in the audit report constituted a default under our revolving credit facility with bank of america  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of commercial banks and commercial financing entities the bofa revolving credit facility  our used vehicle floor plan facility with 
table of contents jpmorgan chase bank  na and bank of america the jpmorgan used vehicle floor plan facility and our new vehicle floor plan facility with general motors acceptance corporation 
as of march   we had received waivers from all of our associated lending partners with respect to these defaults and  as a result  we were in compliance with the covenants contained in these borrowing facilities 
in connection with these waivers  we agreed to reduce the total credit availability under our bofa revolving credit facility by million to million and the total credit availability under our jpmorgan used vehicle floor plan facility by million to million 
on august   a us district court jury in portland  oregon reached a verdict against one of our subsidiaries in an action by four former salesmen alleging claims related to a hostile work environment at our former thomason toyota dealership in gladstone  oregon 
we sold the thomason toyota dealership in  though the alleged conduct involved in this matter occurred in during trial  the court dismissed the plaintiffs claims for race discrimination and retaliation in employment as well as their claims for economic damages 
the jury  however  awarded million in total damages against our subsidiary consisting of million in non economic damages and million in punitive damages 
in a post trial opinion and order issued january   the us district court in portland  oregon reduced the total damages awarded against our subsidiary to million consisting of  in non economic damages and  in punitive damages 
the court gave the plaintiffs the choice of either accepting the reduced award or proceeding with a new trial on damages 
we will seek to further reduce damages if the plaintiffs request a new trial and  if necessary  we will seek to overturn the verdict or seek to eliminate or further reduce damages on appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
we believe that the jury verdict is unsupported by both the evidence and the law  and that we will prevail on appeal 
business strategy focus on premier brand mix  strategic markets and diversification we classify our franchise sales into luxury  mid line import  mid line domestic  value  and heavy trucks 
luxury and mid line imports together accounted for approximately of our new light vehicle retail revenues for the year ended december  over the last two decades  luxury and mid line imports have gained market share at the expense of mid line domestic brands 
luxury and mid line import vehicles have delivered more desirable vehicle models and have demonstrated greater resilience to downturns in the economy  garnered higher customer loyalty and presented more attractive service and used car opportunities 
the mid line import brands are generally viewed as more fuel efficient and continue to be in higher demand during times when gas prices are high 

table of contents the following table reflects the number of franchises and the share of new light retail vehicle revenue represented by each class of franchise as of december  class franchise number of franchises as of december  of new light vehicle retail revenue for the year ended december  light vehicles luxury bmw acura mercedes benz a infiniti lincoln lexus volvo audi cadillac jaguar land rover porsche total luxury mid line import honda nissan b toyota mini mazda volkswagen total mid line import mid line domestic chevrolet ford mercury chrysler dodge buick gmc jeep pontiac total mid line domestic value smart hyundai kia total value total light vehicles

new vehicle sales revenue is diversified among certain manufacturers as shown in the table above 
we believe that our broad geographic coverage as well as diversification among manufacturers decreases our exposure to regional economic downturns and manufacturer specific risks such as warranty issues or production disruption 
see risk factors risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers for a list of such manufacturer specific risks 
each of our dealerships maintains a strong local brand that has been enhanced through local advertising over many years 
we believe our cultivation of strong local brands is beneficial because consumers prefer to interact with a locally recognized brand 
by placing franchises in one geographic location under a single  local brand  we expect to generate advertising synergies and retain customers even as they purchase and service different automobile brands 
maintain flexible cost structure and emphasize expense control we continually focus on controlling expenses at our existing dealerships and those that are integrated into our operations upon acquisition 
we categorize our cost structure in three groups  which are variable  semi variable and fixed 
variable costs include incentive based compensation and vehicle carrying cost 
salespeople  sales managers  service managers  parts managers  service advisors  service technicians and the majority of other non clerical dealership personnel are paid a commission 
the majority of our general manager compensation and virtually all salesperson compensation is tied to profits of the dealership 
in addition  the bonus portion of our salaried employee s compensation is tied to our operating results 
fixed costs include rent  utilities and depreciation expense 
semi variable expenses include base salaries  outside services  travel and entertainment expenses  advertising and loaner vehicle amortization 
we believe we can further manage these types of costs by centralizing our processing systems and capitalizing on best practices among our dealerships  standardizing of compensation and benefit plans  and negotiating contracts with certain of our vendors on a national rather than regional basis 
furthermore  in order to further control our expenses  in the third quarter of  we commenced a corporate and regional restructuring plan  which included the relocation of our corporate offices and the reorganization of our retail network 
we have moved our corporate headquarters to duluth  georgia  and we 
table of contents expect to close our corporate offices in new york  new york and stamford  connecticut  by the end of march we expect this relocation will deliver cost savings of up to million annually  resulting primarily from staffing reductions and lower rent expense 
in addition  the reorganization of our retail network has reduced our operating structure to two regions from four regions and two stand alone platforms 
finally  we are expanding our store level productivity initiatives  focusing on advertising and personnel expenses  improved inventory management and selected technology investments to enhance our productivity 
for a further discussion of the cost savings resulting from our restructuring and productivity initiatives  please see the discussion in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report 
focus on higher margin products and services while new vehicle sales are critical to drawing customers to our dealerships  parts and service  used vehicle retail sales  and finance and insurance generally provide significantly higher profit margins and account for the majority of our profitability 
in addition  we have discipline specific executives at both the corporate and regional levels who focus on increasing the penetration of current services and expanding the breadth of our offerings to customers 
while each of our dealership general managers has flexibility to respond effectively to local market conditions  including market specific advertising and management of inventory mix  each pursues an integrated strategy  as directed from our centralized management team at our corporate office  to enhance profitability and stimulate organic growth 
parts and service 
we offer parts  perform vehicle service work and operate collision repair centers at our dealerships  all of which provide important sources of recurring revenue with high gross profit margins 
we expect to improve the profitability of our parts and service business by i maximizing the use of our service capacity  ii upgrading equipment  where appropriate  iii capitalizing on our regional training programs  and iv continuing to develop long term customer relationships 
over the long term  we intend to expand this higher margin business by adding new service bays and increasing capacity utilization of existing service bays 
to help ensure high levels of customer satisfaction within our parts and service operations  we continue to recruit and train skilled technicians and service advisors to our operations 
in addition  given the increased sophistication of vehicles  our repair operations provide detailed expertise and state of the art diagnostic equipment that we believe independent repair shops cannot adequately provide 
our repair operations also provide manufacturer warranty work that must be done at certified franchise dealerships  rather than through independent dealers 
used vehicles 
we sell used vehicles at all of our franchised dealerships 
used vehicle sales include the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction 
we maximize the profitability of our used vehicle business by maintaining high quality inventory across all price ranges  providing competitive prices  continuing to enhance our marketing initiatives by focusing our efforts on marketing used vehicles through the internet and building customer confidence in our vehicle inventory through manufacturer sponsored and internally developed used car certification programs 
finance and insurance 
historically  we have increased our finance and insurance revenues over the years by offering a broad range of conventional finance and lease alternatives to fund the purchase of new and used vehicles 
moreover  continued in depth sales training and certification efforts and innovative computer technologies have and will serve as important tools in improving our finance and insurance profitability 
we have increased same store dealership generated finance and insurance revenue per vehicle sold to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  we have successfully increased our dealership generated finance and insurance revenue per vehicle sold each year since our inception 

table of contents local management of dealership operations we believe that local management of dealership operations enables our retail network to provide market specific responses to sales  customer service and inventory requirements 
our dealerships are operated as distinct profit centers in which the general managers are responsible for the operations  personnel and financial performance of their dealerships as well as other day to day operations 
our local management teams familiarity with their markets enables them to effectively run day to day operations  market to customers and recruit new employees 
the general manager of each dealership is supported by a management team consisting  in most cases  of a new vehicle sales manager  a used vehicle sales manager  a finance and insurance manager  and a parts and service manager 
this management structure is complemented by regionally centralized technology and financial controls  as well as sharing market intelligence throughout the organization 
see business strategy experienced corporate and regional management below for a discussion of the incentive based pay system for corporate and regional management 
we believe that our leadership at the store level represents some of the best talent in the industry 
our regional executives and store general managers are proven leaders in their local markets and have many years of experience in the automotive retail industry 
in addition  our continued focus on college recruiting  training  development  and retention is designed to maintain our talented management pool 
see business strategy investment in human capital below for further description of certain of our training programs 
we tie compensation of our senior dealership management to performance by relying upon an incentive based pay system 
we compensate our general managers based on dealership profitability  and our department managers and salespeople are similarly compensated based upon departmental profitability and individual performance 
we believe the application of professional management practices provides us with a competitive advantage over many independent dealerships 
we regularly examine our operations in order to identify areas for improvement and disseminate best practices company wide 
experienced corporate management we have a corporate management team that has served in prominent leadership positions within the automotive industry

centralized administrative and strategic functions our corporate headquarters are located in duluth  georgia 
the corporate office is responsible for the capital structure of the business and its expansion and operating strategy 
the implementation of our operational strategy rests with each dealership management team based on the policies and procedures established and promulgated by the corporate office 
furthermore  we employ professional management practices in all aspects of our operations  including information technology and employee training 
our dealership operations are complemented by 
table of contents regionally centralized technology and strategic and financial controls  as well as shared market intelligence throughout the organization 
corporate and dealership management utilize computer based management information systems to monitor each dealership s sales  profitability and inventory on a regular basis 
while in the past we have used various companies to provide our dealer management systems for the data processed at our dealerships  in october  we executed an agreement with dealertrack holdings  inc dealertrack 
dealertrack s arkona dealer management system will become our sole dealer management system 
we began this conversion in late  and anticipate that all of our dealerships will use the arkona dealer management system by as of december   of our dealerships were converted to the arkona dealer management system 
we expect to achieve an annualized cost savings of approximately million annually in our data processing costs upon the completion of our conversion to the arkona dealer management system 
furthermore  we expect that moving toward a single dealer management system through which all our dealerships will process information will create a more efficient retail operation that will result in a better experience for our customers 
we consolidate financial  accounting and operational data received from our dealerships nationwide through a private communication network 
the information from the dealer systems is aggregated at our corporate headquarters to create a consolidated view of the business using hyperion financial products 
our information technology approach enables us to integrate and aggregate the information from a new acquisition 
by creating a connection over our private network between the dealer management system and corporate hyperion financial products  corporate management can view the financial  accounting and operational data of the newly acquired dealership 
hyperion s products allow us to review operating and financial data at a variety of levels 
for example  from our headquarters  management can review the performance of any specific department eg  parts and services at any particular dealership 
this system also allows us to compile and monitor our consolidated financial results in a shorter amount of time 
investment in human capital we recognize that our ability to grow our new vehicle sales is impacted by external factors  including the manufacturers i ability to develop vehicles that meet the consumers satisfaction and vehicles that consumers desire  ii rebates and incentives  as well as iii consumer confidence  iv gas prices  v interest rates  vi the availability of credit for consumers and vii other economic factors 
growth in our parts and service business is dependent on our ability to generate long term customer relationships and having our customers return to our stores for service and repairs 
our finance and insurance business is dependent on our ability to arrange financing for our customers through third party lenders 
in each revenue source of our business  our ability to capture the customer and close the deal will enable us to generate revenue 
in our effort to improve the profitability of all of our revenue sources and set us apart from our competitors  we invest in the training and growth of our employees 
in an effort to provide superior customer service to our customers  our finance and insurance managers  our new and used sales managers and our sales force are certified in the areas of compliance and ethics through third party programs or internally developed programs 
these employees attend classes or seminars on compliance and ethics as such topics relate to the automotive retailing industry  and more specifically  finance and insurance for the finance and insurance managers  and are then required to pass a written examination on these subjects in order to receive certification 
the employees are required to renew their certification annually  which ensures their knowledge of compliance and ethics is current 
furthermore  we believe that by certifying these employees  we build the knowledge base of our employees  which improves morale and performance 
in addition  our parts and service employees undergo training provided by the vehicle manufacturers and certain of our vendors  as well as training arranged by dealership management  as needed  addressing various aspects of our parts and service business 
our parts and service employees are trained so that they can offer new car clinics and service clinics to our customers 
we believe that as the knowledge base of our parts and service employees increases  we not only build their confidence and improve their performance  but also provide better 
table of contents experience for our customers as they interact with those employees 
we believe that a customer who has a positive experience with one of our employees will be a repeat customer  which will lead to the continued growth of our business 
we also have a policy that requires all finance and insurance personnel to go through a standard certification process and undergo continuing eduction in the areas of legal  regulatory and ethical compliance matters 
our corporate and regional executives have also benefited from attending a management training program to assist them in setting and reaching personal and professional goals  and the effective management of their staffs 
through exposure to such training programs  we empower our corporate and regional executive team to work together more efficiently in the management of the business and its employees 
we believe that a motivated management team will have a direct  positive effect on the business 
with a highly motivated and goal oriented workforce  we believe that we can continue to generate improved results 
dealership portfolio management we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities 
in the past  we have focused our acquisition strategy on establishing a presence in new markets through the purchase of multiple individual franchises or through the acquisition of large  profitable and well managed dealership groups with leading market positions 
our present strategy is to become the leader in every market in which we currently operate 
as such  we intend to evaluate tuck in acquisitions that complement our current dealerships 
tuck in acquisitions are typically re branded immediately after acquisition and operate thereafter under our respective local brand name 
by focusing on geographic and brand diversity  we seek to manage economic risk and drive growth and profitability 
because we own dealerships of all major brands and avoid significant concentration with one manufacturer  we are well positioned to respond to changing customer preferences 
we believe that these tuck in acquisitions have facilitated  and will continue to facilitate  our regional operating efficiencies and cost savings 
in addition  we have generally been able to improve the gross profits of tuck in acquisitions within twelve months following the acquisition 
we believe this is due to a number of factors  including improvement in finance and insurance per vehicle sold  additional cost savings in finance  insurance and warranty products because of the size of our company  greater utilization of service bays acquired in the acquisition  improved management practices  and enhanced unit sales volumes related to the strength of our local brand names 
we will also evaluate opportunities to acquire large dealership groups or to enter new markets as such opportunities become available 
we continuously evaluate the financial and operating results of our dealerships  as well as each dealership s geographical location and from time to time  we may seek to sell certain of our dealerships to raise capital or to refine our dealership portfolio 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell our dealerships on terms reasonable to us 
commitment to customer service we are focused on providing a high level of customer service to meet the needs of an increasingly sophisticated and demanding automotive consumer 
we design our dealership service business to meet the needs of our customers and establish relationships that will result in both repeat business and additional business through customer referrals 
furthermore  we provide our dealership managers with incentives to employ more efficient selling approaches  engage in extensive follow up to develop long term relationships with customers and extensively train our sales staff to be able to meet customer needs 

table of contents we continually evaluate innovative ways  and implement new technology  to improve the buying experience for our customers  and believe that our ability to share best practices across our dealerships gives us an advantage over independent dealerships 
for example  our customer relations management tool facilitates communications with our customers before  during and after the sale 
our auto exchange system continues to be our used car inventory management tool 
all of our stores have access to these tools to drive the performance of our employees and enhance customer service 
see also the discussion above under business strategy centralized administrative and strategic functions for a discussion of our expectation of how the use of the arkona dealer management system will improve the customer experience 
in addition  our service and repair operations are an integral part of our overall approach to customer service  providing an opportunity to foster ongoing relationships and improve customer loyalty 
we continue to train our skilled technicians and service advisors to ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service 
we intend to invest in the human capital necessary to ensure that this aspect of our business continues to expand 
marketing our advertising and marketing efforts are focused at the local market level  with the aim of building our business with a broad base of repeat  referral and new customers 
we spend the majority of our advertising dollars on television advertising  followed by internet based advertising  including lead generation  radio  print  direct mail and the yellow pages 
in addition  we also use electronic mail to assist our marketing efforts and to stay in contact with our customers 
the automotive retail industry has traditionally used locally produced  largely non professional materials for advertising  often developed under the direction of each dealership s general manager 
however  we have chosen to create common marketing materials for our brand names using professional advertising agencies 
our total company advertising expense from continuing operations was million for the year ended december   which translates into an average of per retail vehicle sold 
in addition  manufacturers direct advertising spending in support of their brands has historically been a significant component of the total amount spent on new car advertising in the united states 
competition in new vehicle sales  our dealerships compete with other franchised dealerships in their regions 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from the manufacturers 
instead  we rely on advertising and merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation  strong local brand names and location of our dealerships to sell new vehicles 
our used vehicle operations compete with other franchised dealers  independent used car dealers  internet based vehicle brokers and private parties for supply and resale of used vehicles 
see risk factors other risks substantial competition in automobile sales and services may adversely affect our profitability 
we compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty repairs and with other automobile dealers and franchised and independent service centers for non warranty repair and routine maintenance business 
we compete with other automobile dealers  service stores and auto parts retailers in our parts operations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are the use of factory approved replacement parts  price  the familiarity with a manufacturer s brands and models  and the quality of customer service 
a number of regional and national chains as well as some competing franchised dealers may offer certain parts and services at prices lower than our prices 
in arranging financing for our customers vehicle purchases  we compete with a broad range of financial institutions 
in addition  financial institutions are now offering finance and insurance products through the internet  which may reduce our profits on these items 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in providing financing are convenience  interest rates and flexibility in contract length 

table of contents we compete with other national dealer groups and individual investors for acquisitions 
some of our competitors may have greater financial resources and the market may increase acquisition pricing of target dealerships 
see risk factors risks related to our dealership portfolio management there is competition to acquire automotive dealerships  and we may not be able to fully implement our growth through acquisition strategy if attractive targets are acquired by competing buyers or if the market drives prices to the point where an acceptable rate of return is not achievable 
dealer and framework agreements each of our dealerships operates pursuant to a dealer agreement between the dealership and the manufacturer or in some cases the distributor of each brand of new vehicles sold and or serviced at the dealership 
our typical dealer agreement specifies the locations at which the dealer has the right and obligation to sell the manufacturer s vehicles and related parts and products and or to perform certain approved services 
each dealer agreement also governs the use of the manufacturer s trademarks and service marks 
the allocation of new vehicles among dealerships is subject to the discretion of the manufacturer  and generally does not guarantee the dealership exclusivity within a given territory 
most dealer agreements impose requirements on virtually every aspect of the dealer s operations 
for example  most of our dealer agreements contain provisions and standards related to inventories of new vehicles and manufacturer replacement parts  the maintenance of minimum net working capital and in some cases minimum net worth  the achievement of certain sales and customer satisfaction targets  advertising and marketing practices  facilities and signs  products offered to customers  dealership management  personnel training  information systems  and dealership monthly and annual financial reporting 
in addition to requirements under dealer agreements  we are subject to additional provisions contained in supplemental agreements  framework agreements  dealer addenda and manufacturers policies  collectively referred to as framework agreements 
framework agreements impose additional requirements similar to those discussed above 
such agreements also define other standards and limitations  including company wide performance criteria  capitalization requirements  limitations on changes in our ownership or management  limitations on the number of a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us  restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to pledge the stock of certain of our subsidiaries  and conditions for consent to proposed acquisitions  including sales and customer satisfaction criteria as well as limitations on the total local  regional and national market share percentage that would be represented by a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us after giving effect to a proposed acquisition 

table of contents some dealer agreements and framework agreements grant the manufacturer the right to purchase its dealerships from us under certain circumstances  including the occurrence of an extraordinary corporate transaction without the manufacturer s prior consent or a material breach of the framework agreement 
some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements also give the manufacturer a right of first refusal if we propose to sell any dealership representing the manufacturer s brands to a third party 
these agreements may also attempt to limit the protections available under state dealer laws and require us to resolve disputes through binding arbitration 
provisions for termination or non renewal of dealer and framework agreements 
certain of our dealer agreements expire after a specified period of time  ranging from one year to eight years  while other of our agreements have a perpetual term 
we expect to renew expiring agreements in the ordinary course of business 
however  typical dealer agreements give the manufacturer the right to terminate or the option of non renewal of the dealer agreements under certain circumstances  including insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealership  failure to adequately operate the dealership or to maintain required capitalization levels  impairment of the reputation or financial condition of the dealership  change of control of the dealership without manufacturer approval  failure to complete facility upgrades required by the manufacturer or agreed to by the dealer  or material breach of other provisions of a dealer agreement 
see risk factors risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers if we fail to obtain renewals of one or more of our dealer and framework agreements on favorable terms  if certain of our franchises are terminated  or if certain manufacturers rights under their agreements with us are triggered  our operations may be adversely affected  for a further discussion of the risks related to the termination or non renewal of our dealer and framework agreements 
while our dealer agreements may be terminated or not renewed for the reasons listed above  it is possible to negotiate a waiver of termination or non renewal with the manufacturer 
regulations we operate in a highly regulated industry 
under various state laws each of our dealerships must obtain a license in order to establish  operate or relocate a dealership or operate an automotive repair service 
in addition  we are subject to federal  state and local laws regulating the conduct of our business including advertising  motor vehicle and retail installment sales practices  leasing  sales of finance  insurance and vehicle protection products  consumer credit  deceptive trade practices  consumer protection  consumer privacy  money laundering  environmental  land use and zoning  and health and safety and employment practices 

table of contents our business is also subject to laws and regulations generally relating to corporate entities 
we actively make efforts to assure we are in compliance with these laws and related regulations 
see risk factors other risks government regulations and environment regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our profitability 
we benefit from the protection of state dealer laws which limit a manufacturer s ability to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement  provide dealers with protest rights with respect to the addition of dealerships within proscribed geographic areas  and protect dealers against manufacturers unreasonably withholding consent to proposed changes in ownership of dealerships 
however  some framework agreements attempt to limit the protection of state dealer laws 
see risk factors risks related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers the reorganization or bankruptcy of one or more of the vehicle manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our operations  and if state dealer laws that protect automotive retailers are repealed  weakened or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements 
environmental matters we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  the handling and disposal of wastes and the remediation of contamination 
as with automobile dealerships generally  and service and parts and collision repair center operations in particular  our business involves the generation  use  handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances and wastes 
operations involving the management of wastes are subject to requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state statutes 
pursuant to these laws  federal and state environmental agencies have established approved methods for handling  storage  treatment  transportation and disposal of regulated substances and wastes with which we must comply 
our business also involves the use of above ground and underground storage tanks 
under applicable laws and regulations  we are responsible for the proper use  maintenance and abandonment of our regulated storage tanks and for remediation of subsurface soils and groundwater impacted by releases from existing or abandoned storage tanks 
in addition to these regulated tanks  we own  operate  or have otherwise closed in place other underground and above ground devices or containers such as automotive lifts and service pits that may not be classified as regulated tanks  but which could or may have released stored materials into the environment  thereby potentially obligating us to clean up any soils or groundwater resulting from such releases 
we are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at or from our facilities or at facilities where we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  and similar state statutes  imposes liability for the entire cost of a cleanup  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on those that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance 
responsible parties include the owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at such sites 
these responsible parties also may be liable for damages to natural resources 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances 
currently  we are not aware of any material superfund or other remedial liabilities to which we are subject 
further  the federal clean water act and comparable state statutes prohibit discharges of pollutants into regulated waters without the necessary permits  require containment of potential discharges of oil or hazardous substances and require preparation of spill contingency plans 
we are not aware of any non compliance with the wastewater discharge requirements  requirements for the containment of potential discharges and spill contingency planning or other environmental laws applicable to our operations 

table of contents environmental laws and regulations are very complex and it has become difficult for businesses that routinely handle hazardous and non hazardous wastes to achieve and maintain full compliance with all applicable environmental laws 
from time to time we experience incidents and encounter conditions that will not be in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
however  none of our dealerships has been subject to any material environmental liabilities in the past  nor do we know of any fact or condition that would result in any material environmental liabilities being incurred in the future 
nevertheless  environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement change frequently and we believe that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations is likely to continue 
as a result  there can be no assurance that compliance with environmental laws or regulations or the future discovery of unknown environmental conditions will not require additional expenditures by us  or that such expenditures would not be material 
our operations are subject to substantial laws and regulations and related claims and proceedings  any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  people 
we believe our relationship with our employees is favorable 
we do not have employees that are represented by a labor union 
in the future  we may acquire additional businesses that have unionized employees 
certain of our facilities are located in areas of high union concentration  and such facilities are susceptible to union organizing activity 
in addition  because of our dependence on vehicle manufacturers  we may be affected adversely by labor strikes  work slowdowns and walkouts at vehicle manufacturers production facilities and transportation modes 
insurance because of their vehicle inventory and the nature of the automotive retail business  automobile retail dealerships generally require significant levels of insurance covering a broad variety of risks 
our insurance program includes multiple umbrella policies with a total per occurrence and aggregate limit of million 
we also have directors and officers insurance  real property insurance  comprehensive coverage for our vehicle inventory  general liability  worker s compensation  employee medical and employee dishonesty insurance 

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  you should consider carefully the following risk factors when evaluating our business 
risks related to our company if we are unable to generate sufficient cash  our ability to service our debt may be materially adversely affected  and our failure to comply with certain covenants in our debt  mortgage and lease agreements could adversely affect our ability to access our revolving credit facilities and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
we have substantial debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total debt of million  excluding floor plan notes payable and the effects of our terminated fair value hedge on our senior subordinated notes due the notes 
in addition  we and our subsidiaries have the ability to obtain additional debt from time to time to finance acquisitions  real property purchases  capital expenditures or for other purposes  subject to the restrictions contained in our bofa revolving credit facility  our jpmorgan used vehicle floor plan facility and the indentures governing our notes and our senior subordinated notes due the notes 
we will have substantial debt service obligations  consisting of required cash payments of principal and interest  for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we have operating and financial restrictions and covenants in certain of our leases and in our debt instruments  including our revolving credit facilities with bank of america  na and jpmorgan chase bank na  the indentures under our notes and our notes and the mortgage agreements or guarantees for mortgages held with wachovia bank  national association  wachovia financial services  inc  bmw financial services na  llc and wells fargo  na these restrictions and covenants limit  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens or other encumbrances  and to make certain payments including dividends and repurchases of our shares and investments 
because of the uncertainties regarding our compliance with financial covenants during  as discussed below  our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph that indicated there is uncertainty that we will remain in compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements and that condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in its audit report for our financial statements 
the inclusion of this going concern explanatory paragraph constituted a default under our bofa revolving credit facility  jpmorgan used vehicle floor plan facility and our floor plan facilities with general motors acceptance corporation 
we obtained waivers with respect to these defaults from the relevant lenders prior to the filing of this form k with the us securities and exchange commission 
however  there can be no assurances that i our independent public accounting firm will not issue a similar opinion in the future  ii we would be able to obtain waivers to our financial covenants  or iii we can repurchase debt as needed to remain compliant under our financial covenants 
our revolving credit facilities  mortgages and or guarantees related to such mortgages  and certain of our lease agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
in order to satisfy certain of our financial covenants in  we relied in part upon income recognized in connection with our purchases of million of our outstanding debt securities at a significant discount 
these purchases generated approximately million of income before tax in we expect that we may need to engage in similar purchases in order to satisfy our financial covenants during we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to make such repurchases in in amounts and at prices sufficient to satisfy our covenants and our ability to comply with these ratios  including our ability to repurchase debt significantly below face value  may be affected by events beyond our control 
our board of directors has authorized us to use an additional million in cash to repurchase debt securities and or make 
table of contents unscheduled principal payments on our existing mortgages 
currently  our bofa revolving credit facility and our jpmorgan used vehicle floor plan facility limit our ability to purchase our debt securities to million per calendar year  plus of the net proceeds from asset sales during any given calendar year 
failure to satisfy any of these covenants would constitute a default under the relevant debt agreements  which would entitle the lenders under such agreements to terminate our ability to borrow under the relevant agreements and accelerate our obligations to repay outstanding borrowings unless compliance with the covenants is waived 
obtaining such waivers often requires the payment to the bank lenders of certain fees 
if we fail to satisfy any of these covenants  we could be required to apply our available cash to repay these borrowings and we could be prevented from making debt service payments on our notes  our notes  and our senior subordinated convertible notes due in many cases  defaults under one of our agreements could trigger cross default provisions in our other agreements 
if we are unable to comply with our financial or other covenants  we would be required to seek waivers or modifications of our covenants from our lenders  or we would need to raise debt and or equity financing or sell assets to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt 
in light of current depressed conditions in the automotive industry and the exceptionally difficult current conditions in the credit markets generally  we cannot give any assurance that we would be able to successfully take these actions 
a number of our dealerships are located on properties that we lease 
certain of the leases governing such properties have certain covenants with which we must comply 
if we fail to comply with the covenants under our leases  the respective landlords could  among other remedies  terminate the leases and seek damages which could equal the amount to which the accelerated rents under the applicable lease for the remainder of the lease term exceeds the fair market rent over the same periods or evict us from the property 
we have significant indebtedness  which may limit our flexibility to manage our business 
our indebtedness and lease obligations could have important consequences to us  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future  a substantial portion of our current cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations and other purposes  some of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which exposes us to the risk of increasing interest rates  and we may be substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to changing market conditions and regulations 
global financial markets and economic conditions have been  and continue to be  disrupted and volatile 
the debt and equity capital markets have been exceedingly distressed 
these issues  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk and the current weak economic conditions have made  and will likely continue to make  it difficult to obtain funding 
in particular  availability of funds from those markets generally has diminished significantly  while the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially 
also  as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt at maturity at all or on terms similar to current debt  and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers 

table of contents if the retail environment continues to be challenging and our dealerships are unable to generate sufficient cash  our liquidity position may be materially adversely affected and may impact our ability to continue as a going concern 
the automotive retail environment experienced an unprecedented challenging environment during  and we expect that the environment in will continue to be challenging 
excluding the impact of impairment expenses  we expect to experience lower net income in as compared to  as a result of i our expectation of us new vehicle unit sales between million and million  which had been above million since  and was million for  ii retail margins continuing to decrease while manufacturers bring supply in line with demand  and iii continued difficulty for consumers to secure vehicle financing 
if we are unable to generate sufficient operating cash flow  we may need to sell certain of our dealerships or other assets and borrow under our existing credit facilities to generate cash to sustain our operations 
in the current economic environment  there can be no assurance that  if necessary  we will be able to sell our dealerships and other assets in a timely manner and on reasonable terms  if at all 
furthermore  in the event we are required to sell dealership assets to maintain our liquidity  the sale of a material portion of such assets could have an adverse effect on our revenue stream  the size of our operations and the efficiencies that are generated from being a certain corporate size 
if we are unable to generate sufficient operating cash flow or execute the sale of our assets in a timely and lucrative manner  our liquidity may be materially adversely affected  which could impact our ability to continue as a going concern 
although we currently have funds available for borrowings under our credit facilities to finance our operations  our lenders may be unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us if these lenders face bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale 
the inability to draw cash under our credit facilities due to any such event facing any one of our lenders would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
see also  risk factors risks related to our company recent turmoil in the credit markets and financial services industry could negatively impact our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity below 
recent turmoil in the credit markets and financial services industry could negatively impact our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions  an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government and other foreign governments and tighter availability of credit 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  they could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to borrow money to finance operations or obtain credit from creditors were to be impaired 
we currently have revolving credit facilities with bank of america  jpmorgan chase bank  na  and a syndicate of other banks under those credit facilities  and we have hedge transactions in place with wells fargo  na  wachovia financial services  inc  goldman sachs co 
and deutsche bank ag  london branch 
if any of these financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us or have entered into hedge or similar transactions with us are adversely affected by the conditions of the us and international capital markets  they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us or otherwise fulfill their obligations under the relevant transactions  which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
the recent events in the credit markets and financial services industry have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
if these recent trends continue  additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
any additional equity financings will be dilutive to our stockholders and any additional debt financings may involve operating covenants that further restrict our business  beyond the operating covenants currently in place 

table of contents in addition  the current economic crisis could also adversely impact our customers ability to purchase or pay for vehicles or other products and services from us or adversely affect the manufacturers ability to provide us with vehicles  either of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
see also  risk factors risks related to the automotive retail industry a decline of available consumer financing may adversely affect our sales of vehicles and the results of our business below 
if economic conditions in the united states do not improve  and the capital markets remain depressed causing a further negative impact on our stock price  such negative effect on our stock price could jeopardize our listing on the nyse and affect our ability to raise equity in the future 
the united states economy has been in a recession since december  according to the national bureau of economic research  and it is widely believed that certain elements of the economy  such as housing  were in decline before that time 
these general economic conditions have had an adverse effect on the capital markets  causing a sharp decline in the overall stock market and the price of shares of stock in the automotive retailing sector of the economy 
on december   our common stock closed at on the nyse and we had a market capitalization of approximately million  representing a and decline in our stock price and market capitalization  respectively  from december  as of march   our common stock closed at and we had a market capitalization of approximately million 
market or business conditions may continue to decline  and may continue to have a negative impact on our stock price 
if our common stock were to trade at an average day closing market price of less than per share and or our equity market capitalization fell under the million minimum requirement of the nyse  our common stock could be removed from the nyse and traded in the over the counter market 
all of these factors  along with otherwise volatile equity market conditions  could limit our ability to raise new equity capital in the future 
our capital costs and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
we generally finance our purchases of new vehicle inventory and have the ability to finance the purchase of used vehicle inventory using floor plan credit facilities under which we are charged interest at floating rates 
in addition  we have the ability to obtain capital for general corporate purposes  dealership acquisitions and property purchases and improvements under predominantly floating interest rate credit facilities 
therefore  our interest expense from variable rate debt will rise with increases in interest rates 
in addition  a significant rise in interest rates may also have the effect of depressing demand in the interest rate sensitive aspects of our business  particularly new and used vehicle sales  because most of our customers finance their vehicle purchases 
as a result  rising interest rates may have the effect of simultaneously increasing our costs and reducing our revenues 
given our debt composition as of december   each one percent increase in market interest rates would increase our total annual interest expense  including floor plan interest  by million 
risks related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers the reorganization or bankruptcy of one or more of the vehicle manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
certain vehicle manufacturers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and have required government bailout funds 
sustained periods of poor financial performance by a manufacturer may cause it to seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy 
a reorganization by a manufacturer may  among other things  result in a delay in the introduction of new or competitive makes or models  an elimination of dealership locations  an elimination of certain makes or models  a decrease in the value of our inventory as consumer demand drops  a disruption in delivery or availability of service or parts  a delay or failure to reimburse us for warranty work and holdback receivables  a disruption in vehicle deliveries to our dealerships  or a significant disruption in the availability of consumer credit for the purchase or lease of vehicles or negative changes in the terms of such financing 
if an attempted reorganization proves unsuccessful for the manufacturer  the continued financial distress could result in the cessation of its operations 

table of contents in the event of a bankruptcy by a vehicle manufacturer  among other things i the manufacturer could seek to terminate all or certain of our franchises  and their efforts may be successful if the state dealership laws that limit their ability to terminate our franchise agreements are superseded by federal bankruptcy laws  ii if the manufacturer is successful in terminating all or certain of our franchises  we may not receive adequate compensation for them  iii we may not be able to collect some or all of our receivables that are due from such manufacturer and we may be subject to preference claims relating to payments to us made by such manufacturer prior to bankruptcy  iv our cost to obtain financing for our new vehicle inventory may increase with such manufacturer s captive finance subsidiary or the manufacturer s captive finance subsidiary may no longer provide financing for our new vehicle inventory  which may cause us to finance our new vehicle inventory with alternate finance sources on less favorable terms  v consumer demand for such manufacturer s products could be materially adversely affected  especially if costs related to improving such manufacturer s poor financial condition are imputed to the price of its products  vi may result in a significant disruption in the availability of consumer credit to purchase or lease vehicles or negative changes in the terms of such financing  which may negatively impact our sales  vii there may be a reduction in the value of receivables and inventory associated with that manufacturer and viii there may be an impairment of our manufacturer franchise rights  to the extent that such franchise rights are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
the occurrence of any one or more of the above mentioned events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our exposure in these areas of our inventory and manufacturer receivables  net of amounts due to manufacturers  as of december   together with comparative data as of december   are as follows in millions december  december  chrysler brands new vehicle inventory parts inventory receivables  net of payables of million and million  respectively general motors brands new vehicle inventory parts inventory receivables  net of payables of million and million  respectively manufacturer franchise rights ford brands new vehicle inventory parts inventory receivables  net of payables of million manufacturer franchise rights adverse conditions affecting the manufacturers of the vehicles that we sell may negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
our ability to successfully market vehicles to the public depends to a great extent on aspects of our manufacturers operations 
conditions which negatively affect our manufacturers in the following areas could similarly have an adverse affect on our revenues and profitability financial condition  marketing efforts  vehicle design  production capabilities  reputation for quality  
table of contents management  and labor relations 
if we fail to obtain renewals of one or more of our dealer and framework agreements on favorable terms  if certain of our franchises are terminated  or if certain manufacturers rights under their agreements with us are triggered  our operations may be adversely affected 
each of our dealerships operates under the terms of a dealer agreement with the manufacturer or manufacturer authorized distributor of each new vehicle brand it carries and or is authorized to service 
our dealerships may obtain new vehicles from manufacturers  service vehicles  sell new vehicles and display vehicle manufacturers trademarks only to the extent permitted under dealer agreements 
as a result of the terms of our dealer  framework and related agreements and our dependence on these franchise rights  manufacturers exercise a great deal of control over our day to day operations and the terms of these agreements govern key aspects of our operations  acquisition strategy and capital spending 
our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed by manufacturers for a number of reasons  and many of the manufacturers have the right to direct us to divest our dealerships if there is a default under the franchise agreement  an unapproved change of control  or other unapproved events 
although we currently have certain dealer agreements that will expire during  and we expect that these agreements will be renewed  there can be no assurances that we will be able to renew these agreements or that we will be able to obtain renewals on favorable terms 
most of our dealer agreements also provide the manufacturer with the right of first refusal to purchase from us any franchise we seek to sell 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected to the extent that our franchise rights become compromised or our operations restricted due to the terms of our dealer agreements or if we lose franchises representing a significant source of our revenues 
if we fail to comply with the financial covenants contained in certain of our framework agreements  the manufacturers who are parties to such agreements may terminate our dealer agreements with them and cause us to divest our dealerships with them  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
certain of our manufacturers require us to meet certain financial ratios 
our failure to comply with these ratios gives the manufacturer the right to reject proposed acquisitions  and may give them the right to repurchase their franchises for fair value 
the inability to acquire additional dealerships could inhibit the growth of our business  and the repurchase of our dealerships by the manufacturers may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our failure to meet manufacturer consumer satisfaction  financial or sales performance requirements may adversely affect our ability to acquire new dealerships and our profitability 
many manufacturers attempt to measure customers satisfaction with their experience in our sales and service departments through rating systems that are generally known in the automotive retailing industry as consumer satisfaction indexes csi 
csi ratings are in addition to the right of manufacturers to monitor the financial and sales performance of dealerships 
at the time we acquire a dealership or enter into a new dealership or framework agreement  several manufacturers establish sales or performance criteria for that dealership 
these criteria have been modified by various manufacturers from time to time in the past  and we cannot assure you that they will not be further modified or replaced by different criteria in the future 
some of our dealerships have had difficulty from time to time meeting these standards 
we cannot assure you that our dealerships will be able to comply with these standards in the future 
in addition  manufacturers may use these criteria as factors in evaluating applications for acquisitions 
a manufacturer may refuse to consent to our acquisition of one of its franchises if it determines our dealerships do not comply with its performance standards 
this may impede our ability to execute acquisitions and hinder our ability to grow 
in addition  we receive payments and incentives from certain manufacturers based  in part  on csi scores  and future payments may be materially reduced or eliminated if our csi scores decline 

table of contents manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions or divestitures may limit our future growth and impact our profitability 
we are generally required to obtain manufacturer consent before we can acquire any additional dealerships 
in addition  many of our dealer and framework agreements require that we meet certain customer service and sales performance standards as a condition to additional dealership acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will meet these performance standards or that manufacturers will consent to future acquisitions  which may prevent us from being able to take advantage of market opportunities and restrict our ability to expand our business 
the process of applying for and obtaining manufacturer consents can take a significant amount of time  generally to days or more 
delays in consummating acquisitions caused by this process may negatively affect our ability to acquire dealerships that we believe will produce acquisition synergies and integrate well into our overall growth strategy 
in addition  manufacturers typically establish minimum capital requirements for each of their dealerships on a case by case basis 
as a condition to granting consent to a proposed acquisition  a manufacturer may require us to remodel and upgrade our facilities and capitalize the subject dealership at levels we would not otherwise choose  causing us to divert our financial resources from uses that management believes may be of higher long term value to us 
furthermore  the exercise by manufacturers of their right of first refusal to acquire a dealership may prevent us from acquiring dealerships that we have identified as important to our growth  thereby having an adverse affect on our ability to grow through acquisitions 
likewise  from time to time  we may determine that it is in our best interest to divest of a dealership 
parties that are interested in acquiring our dealership must also seek the consent of the manufacturers 
the refusal by the manufacturer to approve a potential buyer would delay the divestiture of the dealership  as we would either have to find another potential buyer or wait until the buyer is able to meet the requirements of the manufacturer 
a delay in the sale of a dealership may have a negative impact on our profitability and an adverse affect on our business 
many vehicle manufacturers place limits on the total number of franchises that any group of affiliated dealerships may own 
certain manufacturers place limits on the number of franchises or share of total brand vehicle sales maintained by an affiliated dealership group on a national  regional or local basis  as well as limits on store ownership in contiguous markets 
if we reach these limits  we may be prevented from making further acquisitions  which could affect our growth 
if state dealer laws that protect automotive retailers are repealed  weakened or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements 
applicable state dealer laws generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
though unsuccessful to date  manufacturers lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of state dealer laws 
we have framework agreements with certain of our manufacturers 
among other provisions  these agreements attempt to limit the protections available to dealers under state dealer laws 
if dealer laws are repealed in the states in which we operate  manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice  an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause 
without the protection of state dealer laws  it may also be more difficult for our dealers to renew their dealer agreements upon expiration 
furthermore  if a manufacturer seeks protection from creditors in bankruptcy  it is possible that the federal bankruptcy laws may supersede the state laws which protect automotive retailers

table of contents our dealerships depend upon vehicle sales and  therefore  their success depends in large part upon customer demand for the particular vehicle lines they carry 
the success of our dealerships depends in large part on the overall success of the vehicle lines they carry 
historically  we have generated most of our revenue through new vehicle sales 
new vehicle sales also tend to lead to sales of higher margin products and services such as finance and insurance products and parts and services 
although we have sought to limit our dependence on any one vehicle brand  we have focused our new vehicle sales operations on mid line import and luxury brands 
for the year ended december   brands representing or more of our revenues from new light vehicle retail sales were as follows brand of total new light vehicle retail sales honda nissan toyota bmw mercedes benz lexus ford acura no other brand accounted for more than of our total new light vehicle retail sales revenue for the year ended december  if we fail to obtain a desirable mix of popular new vehicles from manufacturers  our profitability will be negatively impacted 
we depend on manufacturers to provide us with a desirable mix of popular new vehicles 
typically  popular vehicles produce the highest profit margins but tend to be the most difficult to obtain from manufacturers 
manufacturers generally allocate their vehicles among their franchised dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership and in some instances on the level of capital expenditures 
if our dealerships experience prolonged periods of sales declines  those manufacturers may cut back their allotments of popular vehicles to our dealerships and new vehicle sales and profits may decline 
furthermore  if a manufacturer fails to produce desirable vehicles or has a reputation for producing undesirable vehicles  and we own dealerships of that manufacturer  our revenues at those dealerships could be adversely affected as consumers veer their purchases toward more desirable brands  makes and models 
if automobile manufacturers reduce or discontinue incentive programs  our sales volumes may be adversely affected 
our dealerships benefit from certain sales incentives  warranties and other programs of our manufacturers that are intended to promote and support new vehicle sales 
some key incentive programs include customer rebates on new vehicles  dealer incentives on new vehicles  special financing or leasing terms  warranties on new and used vehicles  and sponsorship of used vehicle sales by authorized new vehicle dealers 
manufacturers often make many changes to their incentive programs during each year 
a reduction or discontinuation of key manufacturers incentive programs may reduce our new vehicle unit sales and related revenue 

table of contents manufacturers restrictions regarding a change in our stock ownership may result in the termination or forced sale of our franchises  which may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements with manufacturers prohibit transfers of any ownership interests of a dealership or  in some cases  its parent  without manufacturer consent 
our agreements with some manufacturers provide that  under certain circumstances  we may lose the franchise either through termination or forced sale if a person or entity acquires an ownership interest in us above a specified level or if a person or entity acquires the right to vote a specified level of our common stock without the approval of the applicable manufacturer 
violations by our stockholders of these ownership restrictions are generally outside of our control and may result in the termination or non renewal of our dealer and framework agreements or forced sale of one or more franchises  which may have a material adverse effect on us 
these restrictions may also prevent or deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and  therefore  may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
risks related to the automotive retail industry a continued decline in consumer demand will adversely affect our profitability 
our business is heavily dependent on consumer demand and preferences 
we have witnessed severe economic conditions in the us and globally in and the economic forecast for is equally bleak 
the seasonally adjusted annual rate saar of new vehicle sales in the us decreased to million in the fourth quarter  compared to million in us industry wide vehicle sales for the full year of our revenues will be materially and adversely affected if the downward trend in overall levels of consumer spending is not reversed 
retail vehicle sales are cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
these cycles are often dependent on general economic conditions and consumer confidence  as well as the level of discretionary personal income  credit availability and interest rates 
the current economic climate in the united states and future recessions may have a material adverse effect on our retail business  particularly sales of new and used automobiles 
in addition  fuel prices in reached historically high levels 
significant or sustained increases in gasoline prices could cause a reduction in automobile purchases and a shift in buying patterns from luxury or suv models which typically provide higher profit margins to retailers to smaller  more economical vehicles which typically have lower profit margins 
a continued preference for smaller  more economic vehicles with lower profit margins by consumers may have an adverse affect on our revenues and results of operations 
a decline of available consumer financing may adversely affect our sales of vehicles and the results of our business 
the majority of vehicle buyers finance their purchases  particularly those seeking to purchase used vehicles 
during  consumers experienced a decline in the availability of credit due to a tightening of the lending markets 
if there is a continued decline in the availability of credit or an increase in the cost to consumers for such credit  and such decline is sustained over several periods  the ability of consumers to purchase vehicles could be limited  resulting in a decline in our vehicle sales 
retail sales of used vehicles generally have higher gross margins than new vehicles 
a decline in our vehicle sales could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and an adverse effect on our profitability 
our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in our local markets  even if those conditions are not prominent nationally 
our performance is also subject to local economic  competitive and other conditions prevailing in our various geographic areas 
our dealerships currently are located in the atlanta  austin  chapel hill  charlotte  charlottesville  dallas fort worth  fayetteville  fort pierce  fresno  greensboro  greenville  houston  jackson  jacksonville  little rock  los angeles  orlando  princeton  richmond  sacramento  st 
louis and tampa markets and the results of our operations therefore depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending levels in those areas 

table of contents a decline of available financing in the sub prime lending market may adversely affect our sales of used vehicles 
the majority of vehicle buyers  particularly those seeking to purchase used vehicles  finance the purchase of such vehicles 
sub prime lenders have historically provided financing to those buyers who  for a number of reasons  do not have access to traditional financing  including those buyers who have a poor credit history or lack the down payment necessary to purchase a vehicle 
sub prime lenders have become more stringent with their credit standards  which has made it more difficult for consumers needing sub prime financing to obtain credit 
furthermore  the sub prime lenders may continue to apply higher standards in the future 
if there is a continuous decline in the availability of credit in the sub prime lending market  the ability of these consumers to purchase vehicles could be limited  resulting in a decline in our used vehicle sales 
retail sales of used vehicles generally have higher gross margins than new vehicles 
a decline in our used vehicle sales could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
the results of our second and third quarter results may be disproportionately affected by adverse conditions 
the automobile industry is subject to seasonal variations in revenues 
demand for automobiles is generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
accordingly  we expect our revenues and operating results generally to be lower in our first and fourth quarters than in our second and third quarters 
if conditions surface during the second or third quarters that weaken automotive sales  such as severe weather in the geographic areas in which our dealerships operate  war  high fuel costs  depressed economic conditions or similar adverse conditions  our revenues for the year will be disproportionately adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected by import product restrictions  foreign trade risks and currency valuations that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles or parts profitably 
a portion of our new vehicle business involves the sale of vehicles  parts or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  our operations are subject to customary risks of importing merchandise  including import duties  exchange rates  trade restrictions  work stoppages and general political and socio economic conditions in other countries 
the united states or the countries from which our products are imported may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adjust presently prevailing quotas  duties or tariffs  which may affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and or parts at reasonable prices 
the relative weakness of the us dollar against foreign currencies may adversely affect our cost of purchasing certain vehicles  which may also result in an increase in the retail price of such vehicles  which could discourage consumers from purchasing such vehicles 
this could adversely impact our profitability 
risks related to our dealership portfolio management if we are unable to acquire and successfully integrate additional dealerships  we will be unable to realize desired results and acquired operations may drain resources from comparatively profitable operations 
we believe that the automobile retailing industry is a mature industry whose sales are significantly impacted by the prevailing economic climate in local markets 
accordingly  we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to manage expansion  control costs in our operations and acquire and integrate acquired dealerships into our organization 
in pursuing our strategy of acquiring other dealerships  we face risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions 
these risks include  but are not limited to failing to obtain manufacturers consents to acquisitions of additional franchises  incurring significant transaction related costs for both completed and failed acquisitions  incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses  
table of contents failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships and impairing relationships with employees  incurring undisclosed liabilities at acquired dealerships  disrupting our ongoing business and diverting our management resources to newly acquired dealerships  and impairing relationships with manufacturers and customers as a result of changes in management 
we may not adequately anticipate all the demands that our growth will impose on our personnel  procedures and structures  including our financial and reporting control systems  data processing systems and management structure 
moreover  our failure to retain qualified management personnel at any acquired dealership may increase the risk associated with integrating the acquired dealership 
if we cannot adequately anticipate and respond to these demands  we may fail to realize acquisition synergies and our resources will be focused on incorporating new operations into our structure rather than on areas that may be more profitable 
see also risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions or divestitures may limit our future growth and impact our profitability 
there is competition to acquire automotive dealerships  and we may not be able to fully implement our growth through acquisition strategy if attractive targets are acquired by competing buyers or if the market drives prices to the point where an acceptable rate of return is not achievable 
we believe that the united states automotive retailing market is fragmented and offers many potential acquisition candidates that meet our target criteria 
however  we compete with several other national  regional and local dealer groups  and other strategic and financial buyers  some of which may have greater financial resources 
competition for attractive acquisition targets may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us  and increased acquisition costs 
we will have to forego acquisition opportunities to the extent that we cannot negotiate acquisitions on acceptable terms 
other risks substantial competition in automobile sales and services may adversely affect our profitability 
the automotive retail and service industry is highly competitive with respect to price  service  location and selection 
our competition includes franchised automobile dealerships in our markets that sell the same or similar new and used vehicles  privately negotiated sales of used vehicles  internet based used vehicle brokers that sell used vehicles to consumers  service center chain stores  and independent service and repair shops 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers 
we typically rely on advertising  merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation and dealership location to sell new and used vehicles 
our dealer agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer s product within a given geographic area 
our revenues or profitability may be materially and adversely affected if competing dealerships expand their market share or additional franchises are awarded in our markets 

table of contents government regulations and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our profitability 
we are subject to a wide range of federal  state and local laws and regulations  including local licensing requirements 
these laws regulate the conduct of our business  including motor vehicle and retail installment sales practices  leasing  sales of finance  insurance and vehicle protection products  consumer credit  deceptive trade practices  consumer protection  consumer privacy  money laundering  advertising  land use and zoning  and health and safety and employment practices 
environmental laws and regulations govern  among other things  discharges into the air and water  storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  the handling and disposal of wastes and remediation of contamination arising from spills and releases 
in addition  we may also have liability in connection with materials that were sent to third party recycling  treatment and or disposal facilities under federal and state statutes 
these federal and state statutes impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination 
similar to many of our competitors  we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such federal and state statutes 
if we or our employees at the individual dealerships violate or are alleged to violate these laws and regulations  we could be subject to individual or consumer class actions  administrative  civil or criminal actions investigations or actions and adverse publicity 
such actions could expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties  including suspension or revocation of our licenses and franchises to conduct dealership operations 
some jurisdictions regulate finance fees and administrative or document fees that may be charged in connection with vehicle sales  which could restrict our ability to generate revenue from these activities 
future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practices have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fsp aba a  which changed the accounting for convertible debt that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
fsp aba a will cause an increase to our interest expense by million in 
table of contents the loss of key personnel may adversely affect our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team 
manufacturer dealer or framework agreements may require the prior approval of the applicable manufacturer before any change is made in dealership general managers or other management positions 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees may materially impair the profitability of our operations 
in addition  we may need to hire additional managers as we expand 
potential acquisitions are viable to us only if we are able to retain experienced managers or obtain replacement managers should the owner or manager of the acquired dealership not continue to manage the business 
the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate  particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel  is highly competitive and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 
the loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers may adversely affect the ability of our dealerships to conduct their operations in accordance with the standards set by us or the manufacturers 
we depend on our executive officers as well as other key personnel 
most of our key personnel are not bound by employment agreements  and those with employment agreements are bound only for a limited period of time 
further  we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key personnel 
if we are unable to retain our key personnel  we may be unable to successfully develop and implement our business plans

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states operating franchises dealership locations in metropolitan markets within states as of december  we offer an extensive range of automotive products and services  including new and used vehicles  vehicle maintenance  replacement parts and collision repair services  and financing  insurance and service contracts 
we offer domestic and foreign brands of new vehicles  including heavy truck brands 
we also operate collision repair centers that serve customers in our local markets 
during the third quarter of  we initiated a phased restructuring plan  which included the relocation of our corporate offices and the reorganization of our retail network 
we have moved our corporate headquarters to duluth  georgia and we expect to close our corporate offices in new york  new york  and stamford  connecticut  by the end of march our retail network reorganization has reduced our operating structure to two regions  east and west  from our previous structure of four regions and two stand alone platforms  and includes nine locally branded dealership groups i our east region includes our coggin dealerships  operating primarily in the florida markets of jacksonville  fort pierce and orlando  our courtesy dealerships operating in tampa  florida  our crown dealerships operating in new jersey  north carolina  south carolina and virginia  and our nalley dealerships operating in atlanta  georgia  and ii our west region includes our mcdavid dealerships operating throughout texas  our north point dealerships operating in little rock  arkansas  our california dealerships operating in los angeles  sacramento and fresno  our plaza dealerships operating in st 
louis  missouri  and our gray daniels dealerships operating in jackson  mississippi 
our revenues are derived primarily from i the sale of new vehicles to individual retail customers new light vehicle retail  commercial customers fleet and new heavy trucks heavy trucks the terms new light vehicle retail  fleet and heavy trucks being collectively referred to as new  ii the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers used retail and to other dealers at auction wholesale the terms used retail and wholesale being collectively referred to as used  iii maintenance and collision repair services and the sale of automotive parts collectively referred to as parts and service  and iv the arrangement of vehicle financing and the sale of various insurance  warranty and maintenance products collectively referred to as f i 
we evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold  our parts and service operations based on aggregate gross profit  and f i based on f i per vehicle sold 
we assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit by comparing the year to year results of stores that we have operated for at least twelve full months 
our organic growth is dependent upon the execution of our balanced automotive retailing and service business strategy as well as our strong brand mix  which is heavily weighted towards luxury and mid line import brands 
our vehicle sales have historically fluctuated with general  local and national economic conditions  including consumer confidence  availability of consumer credit and fuel prices 
we believe that the impact on our business by any future negative trends in new vehicle sales will be partially mitigated by i the stability of our parts and service operations  ii the variable nature of significant components of our cost structure and iii our advantageous brand mix 
historically  our brand mix has been less affected by market volatility than the us automobile industry as a whole 
we expect the recent industry wide gain in market share of the luxury and mid line import brands to continue in the near future 
our gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix 
the sale of new vehicles generally results in lower gross profit margin than used vehicle sales and sales of parts and services 
as a result  when used vehicle and parts and service revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue  we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase 
we continue to implement new initiatives specifically designed to improve our high margin businesses and to leverage our selling  general and administrative sg a expense structure  although such initiatives may not keep pace with declining margins and lower gross profit as a result of lower sales volumes 

table of contents sg a expenses consist primarily of fixed and incentive based compensation  advertising  rent  insurance  utilities and other customary operating expenses 
a significant portion of our cost structure is variable such as sales commissions  or controllable such as advertising  generally allowing us to adapt to changes in the retail environment over the long term 
we evaluate commissions paid to salespeople as a percentage of retail vehicle gross profit and all other sg a expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total gross profit 
our operating results are generally subject to changes in the economic environment as well as seasonal variations 
we tend to generate more revenue and operating income in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
generally  the seasonal variations in our operations are caused by factors related to weather conditions  changes in manufacturer incentive programs  model changeovers and consumer buying patterns  among other things 
we anticipate that certain automotive manufacturers will continue to use a combination of vehicle pricing and financing incentive programs to increase demand for their product offerings 
in addition  we believe the automotive manufacturers will adjust production to meet consumer demand  however  we do not expect that the near term production adjustments by automotive manufacturers will be sufficient to align inventories with current consumer demand 
the automotive retail market declined significantly throughout  and our results reflect the impact of weak economic conditions in the us  including turmoil in the debt markets  broad declines in the equity markets and continued weakness in the housing markets 
the seasonally adjusted annual rate saar of new vehicle sales in the us decreased to million in the fourth quarter  compared to million in us industry wide vehicle sales for the full year of the economic environment was particularly weak in florida during  which has historically generated over of our total revenues 
tighter lending standards for automotive financing and certain manufacturers decisions to reduce support of customer leasing programs has limited some customers ability to purchase vehicles 
in addition  rapid changes in customer vehicle preferences due to volatility of gasoline prices provided further challenges for us during the second half of while us vehicle sales for all major vehicle manufacturers have declined during the current difficult economic environment  us domestic manufacturers have contributed a disproportionate amount of the decline in us industry wide vehicle sales 
the financial condition of the domestic manufacturers continued to deteriorate during  and the domestic manufacturers may require additional government assistance to avoid bankruptcy 
although the full impact on us of a bankruptcy of any one or more of the domestic manufacturers is not determinable at this time  such bankruptcy could have a material adverse impact on our operations  liquidity position and financial results 
risks associated with a manufacturer bankruptcy include our ability to collect net receivables due from manufacturers  a reduction in the values of our new vehicle and parts inventory and an impairment of our manufacturer franchise rights  to the extent that such franchise rights are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
our exposure in these areas as of december   together with comparable data as of december   are as follows in millions december  december  chrysler brands new vehicle inventory parts inventory receivables  net of payables of million and million  respectively general motors brands new vehicle inventory parts inventory receivables  net of payables of million and million  respectively manufacturer franchise rights ford brands new vehicle inventory parts inventory receivables  net of payables of million manufacturer franchise rights 
table of contents in addition  we rely on the manufacturer captive finance companies of ford motor company and general motors for new vehicle floor plan financing 
the bankruptcy of either of these domestic manufacturers could result in an attempt by the related captive finance company to terminate our floor plan financing  which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and liquidity position 
we expect to continue to be a very challenging retail environment  which will continue to negatively impact new vehicle  used vehicle and f i revenue 
we have experienced increasing momentum in period over period parts and service sales declines  with the fourth quarter of having the largest sales decline in our history 
we expect it will be challenging to maintain parts and service revenue in however  we expect the luxury and mid line import brands  which comprised approximately of our light vehicle unit volumes in the fourth quarter of  will continue to increase their share of the us market 
excluding the impact of impairment expenses  we expect to experience lower net income in as compared to  as a result of our expectation i of new vehicle unit sales between million and million in  which had been above million since  and was million for  ii that retail margins will remain under pressure while manufacturers bring supply in line with demand  and iii that continued difficulty for consumers to secure vehicle financing 
as a result of our lower expectations of net income  it may be necessary for us to repurchase debt significantly below face value in order to remain in compliance with the financial covenants included in our debt and lease agreements 
see also the discussion under  risk factors risks related to our company if we are unable to generate sufficient cash  our ability to service our debt may be materially adversely affected  and our failure to comply with certain covenants in our debt  mortgage and lease agreements could adversely affect our ability to access our revolving credit facilities and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
management s plan for managing through the current economic crisis in response to the weakening us automotive retail environment in and our expectation for continued weakness in us automotive sales in  we took action to further align our expense structure to current business levels  including our phased restructuring plan  which was initiated during the third quarter of  and our store level productivity initiatives 
we expect that the relocation of our corporate offices will deliver pre tax cost savings of up to million annually  resulting principally from staffing reductions and lower rent expense  from which we began to benefit in january  and expect to receive full benefit beginning in april we expect that the reorganization of our operating structure to two regions will reduce the annual pre tax operating expenses of our regions  consisting of personnel and rent expense  by approximately million annually 
we began to experience the benefit from our restructuring plan in january  and expect to receive full benefit beginning in july in addition to our phased restructuring  other recent cost saving measures include i a salary reduction for executive management  ii no bonuses or raises for corporate employees  iii suspension of k matching contributions for employees with a salary greater than  and iv suspension of the company matching contributions for all employees in our deferred compensation plan for these efforts  combined with our store level productivity initiatives  delivered a million reduction in same store sg a expense in and  more recently  a million reduction in same store sg a expense in the fourth quarter of  compared to the corresponding quarter of overall  our nationwide workforce was reduced by during the second half of looking ahead  our phased restructuring plan and store level productivity initiatives have been designed with the objective of structuring our business to be profitable in the current  depressed automotive retail market 
in addition to our expense reduction initiatives  in the fourth quarter of  we placed a greater focus on working capital efficiency and liquidity  as well as managing our capital structure to ensure compliance with our debt covenants 
we repurchased a total of million of our senior subordinated notes for million  resulting in a gain of million  which is net of a million pro rata write off of related debt issuance costs 
in addition  we reviewed our dealership portfolio to limit our exposure to domestic manufacturers by selling stores  closing stores and reducing new vehicle inventory 
we continuously evaluate the financial and operating results of our dealerships  as well as our geographic exposure  and expect to refine our dealership portfolio through strategic divestitures 
we may use the proceeds from the future sale of dealerships to 
table of contents supplement our liquidity position in the current difficult economic environment and to manage our capital structure in order to remain in compliance with the financial covenants included in our debt agreements 
please refer to liquidity and capital resources for further discussion 
basis of presentation management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements which have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  uncertainty exists regarding our need to repurchase debt and the potential need to seek waivers or modifications of our debt covenants from our lenders to maintain compliance with our debt covenants 
management s plans concerning these matters are also described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty

the million decrease in new vehicle revenue was primarily a result of a million decrease in same store light vehicle revenue due to a decrease in same store light vehicle retail unit sales and a decrease in same store fleet unit sales 
these decreases were partially offset by million of revenue derived from acquisitions 
the decreases in new vehicle revenue was driven by declining consumer confidence  an overall weak economic environment  tighter lending standards and a mix shift toward more fuel efficient  lower priced vehicles  and away from the higher priced trucks and suvs 
the new vehicle business declined significantly throughout we experienced sales decreases across all brands  however  our sales decreases were generally in line with overall us vehicle sales and brand specific sales in our regions 
new vehicle saar reached its lowest level since the first quarter of  decreasing to million in the fourth quarter of  from million during the full year of our revenue was impacted by turmoil in the financial markets  which led to tighter lending standards for manufacturer captive and bank financing  including decreasing loan to value ratios and increasing credit score requirements 
unit volumes declined in each brand segment including a decrease in same store light vehicle retail unit sales from our mid line domestic brands  a decrease from our luxury brands and a decrease from our mid line import brands 
we believe that it has been difficult for manufacturers to adapt in the short term to the sharp decrease in consumer demand and as a result  it has been challenging for us to adjust our inventories to consumer demand and maintain retail margins 
however  we continue to benefit from our brand mix as mid line domestic brands continue to lose market share to the luxury and mid line import brands 
in addition  we expect a significant amount of us dealerships to close during the year  and believe that most of these dealerships will be domestic dealerships  which we anticipate will result in market share gains for mid line import and luxury dealerships 
the million decrease in new vehicle gross profit was due to a million decrease in same store light vehicle gross profit  resulting from a decrease in same store light vehicle retail unit sales 
table of contents and a basis point decrease in same store gross margin 
these decreases were partially offset by million of gross profit derived from acquisitions 
the unit sales and margin decreases reflect a competitive marketplace with less business available due to the overall weak economic environment and tighter lending standards 
we continue to experience a mix shift away from higher margin truck and suvs towards more fuel efficient  lower gross margin cars

the million decrease in used vehicle revenue includes a million decrease in same store retail revenue and a million decrease in same store wholesale revenue  partially offset by million derived from dealership acquisitions 
the million decrease in used vehicle gross profit was primarily a result of a million decrease in same store retail gross profit 
the decrease in used vehicle retail revenue and gross profit reflect i a weak retail environment  ii a tighter lending environment  iii lower sales to sub prime customers and iv a sharp increase in consumer demand for smaller and more fuel efficient vehicles and away from trucks and suvs 
the rapid decline in consumer demand for trucks and suvs has caused us to lower our inventory and retail more of these vehicles that otherwise would have been wholesaled because of weak demand for these vehicles at auction 
the decrease in used vehicle wholesale revenue was a result of lower new retail and used retail unit sales  which provided fewer vehicles from trade ins to sell at auction 
in addition  the wholesale markets were virtually closed towards the end of the third quarter and early fourth quarter of  which further reduced our wholesale results 
we have experienced reduced used vehicle sales to sub prime customers  primarily as a result of tighter lending standards  particularly in the second half of we are closely managing our sub prime business and continue to believe there is opportunity to improve our used vehicle profitability by offering appropriately priced used vehicle inventory  however  we expect our sub prime gross margins to decrease from their levels as a result of financing providers lowering their loan to value ratios and increasing credit score requirements 
we continue to focus on inventory management  including aligning our inventory to meet consumer demands and decreasing our inventory in response to the slower retail environment 
although our same store wholesale losses were million  we decreased our used vehicle inventory by in as a result  we believe our used vehicle inventory is now better aligned with consumer demand  with approximately days sales in our year end inventory 
we expect that this improvement in our used vehicle inventory will help mitigate the impact of the challenging economic environment on our used vehicle performance 
in addition  we continue to focus on the growth of all used vehicle product offerings  including factory certified  traditional and low value trade ins

same store revenue and gross profit from our wholesale parts business increased million and million  respectively 
we continue to experience decreases in our warranty business as same store warranty revenue decreased million as a result of improvements in the quality of vehicles produced in recent years 
despite the challenging retail and overall economic environment  our parts and service business during remained relatively stable 
however  we have experienced increasing momentum in period over period sales declines in the second half of  with the fourth quarter being the largest sales decline in our history  down on a same store basis 
we believe that in difficult economic times consumers may delay new vehicle purchases  but will continue to require maintenance and repair work 
however  we believe that customers are deferring larger cost repair items 
we continue to focus on improving our customer pay business over the long term as we i continue to invest in additional service capacity  where appropriate  ii upgrade equipment  iii improve customer retention and customer satisfaction and iv capitalize on our regional training programs 
in addition  we expect to recognize improved parts and service gross profit in the future from heavy trucks as a result of the addition of service capacity at our heavy truck service center in  and as the customers who purchased vehicles prior to the emission law changes in january  which accelerated demand for model year heavy trucks into and the first half of  begin to bring their vehicles in for maintenance and repairs

the decrease in same store dealership generated f i was a result of a decrease in same store unit sales  partially offset by a increase in same store dealership generated f i per vehicle sold 
the increase in dealership generated f i per vehicle sold was attributable to i improved f i performance of the bottom third of our stores  ii lengthening of finance contract terms and iii mix shift away from sub prime customers  as these deals typically generate less finance and insurance revenue 
these increases were partially offset by lower financing commissions due to tighter lending standards 
the tighter lending standards included lower loan to value ratios  which decrease our opportunity to offer customers our full menu of finance and insurance products 
in addition  customers were very concerned about their monthly payment during the difficult economic environment 
overall  our f i performance is dependent on unit sales and the lending environment 
we expect to experience lower f i per vehicle sold levels in compared to as a result of i tighter lending standards  including loan to value constraints  ii lower income as a result of our decision to discontinue our investments in consumer loans and iii lower f i retro payments as a result of the sale of our remaining interest in a pool of extended maintenance contracts

during the third quarter of  we initiated a phased restructuring plan  which included the relocation of our corporate offices and the reorganization of our retail network 
we have moved our corporate headquarters to duluth  georgia  and we will close our corporate offices in new york  new york  and stamford  connecticut  by the end of march we expect that this relocation will deliver pre tax cost savings of up to million annually  resulting principally from staffing reductions and lower rent expense 
during  we incurred pre tax costs of million associated with our restructuring plans 
in addition  other recent cost saving measures include i a salary reduction for executive management  ii no bonuses or raises for corporate employees  iii suspension of k matching contributions for employees with a salary greater than  and iv suspension of the company matching contributions for all eligible employees in our deferred compensation plan for our retail network reorganization has reduced our operating structure to two regions  from our previous structure of four regions and two stand alone platforms 
we expect that this restructuring will reduce the annual pre tax operating expenses of our regions  consisting of personnel and rent expense  by approximately million annually 
we expect approximately of this plan to be complete by the first quarter of and the remaining to be complete by the end of the third quarter of finally  we are expanding our store level productivity initiatives  focusing on personnel and advertising expenses  improved inventory management  and selected technology investments to enhance our efficiency

depreciation and amortization the million increase in depreciation and amortization expense was a result of property and equipment acquired during and  including the purchase of million of previously leased property in the second quarter of impairment expenses during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a sustained decline in market capitalization and a significant decline in total revenue due to overall retail industry conditions driven by declining consumer confidence  tightening lending standards  rising gas prices  changes in consumer demand and falling home prices

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand as of december   the funds that will be generated through future operations  and the funds available for borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  floor plan facilities  mortgage financing  proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and asset sales will be sufficient to fund our debt service and working capital requirements  commitments and contingencies  debt repurchases  acquisitions  capital expenditures and any seasonal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents covenants because of the uncertainties regarding our compliance with financial covenants during  as discussed below  our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph that indicated there is uncertainty that we will remain in compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements and that condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in its audit report for our financial statements 
the inclusion of this going concern explanatory paragraph constituted a default under our bofa revolving credit facility  jpmorgan used vehicle floor plan facility and our new vehicle floor plan facilities with general motors acceptance corporation 
we obtained waivers with respect to these defaults from the relevant lenders prior to the filing of this annual report on form k with the us securities and exchange commission 
we are subject to a number of financial covenants in our various debt and lease agreements  including those described below 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
in order to satisfy certain of our financial covenants in  we relied in part upon income recognized in connection with our purchases of million of our outstanding debt securities at a significant discount 
see subordinated note repurchases below 
these purchases generated approximately million of income before tax in we expect that we may need to engage in similar purchases in order to satisfy our financial covenants during we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to make such repurchases in in amounts and at prices sufficient to satisfy our covenants 
our board of directors has authorized us to use an additional million in cash to repurchase debt securities and or make unscheduled principal payments on our existing mortgages 
currently  our bofa revolving credit facility and our jpmorgan used vehicle floor plan facility limit our ability to purchase our debt securities to million per calendar year  plus of the net proceeds from asset sales during any given calendar year 
failure to satisfy any of our debt covenants would constitute a default under the relevant debt agreements  which would entitle the lenders under such agreements to terminate our ability to borrow under the relevant agreements and accelerate our obligations to repay outstanding borrowings  if any  unless compliance with the covenants is waived 
in many cases  defaults under one of our agreement could trigger cross default provisions in our other agreements 
if we are unable to remain in compliance with our financial or other covenants  we would be required to seek waivers or modifications of our covenants from our lenders  or we would need to raise debt and or equity financing or sell assets to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt 
in light of current depressed conditions in the automotive industry and the exceptionally difficult current conditions in the credit markets generally  we cannot give any assurance that we would be able to successfully take these actions

borrowings of floor plan notes payable associated with inventory acquired in connection with all acquisitions are classified as a financing activity 
cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in operating activities differ from cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in financing activities only to the extent that the former are cash flows related to amounts payable to a lender affiliated with the entity from which we purchased the related inventory while the latter are cash flows related to amounts payable to a lender not affiliated with the entity from which we purchased the related inventory 
floor plan borrowings are required by all vehicle manufacturers for the purchase of new vehicles  and all floor plan providers require amounts borrowed for the purchase of a vehicle to be repaid immediately after the related vehicle is sold 
as a result  we believe that it is important to understand the relationship between the cash flows of all of our floor plan notes payable and new vehicle inventory in order to understand our working capital and operating cash flow and to be able to compare our operating cash flow to that of our competitors ie  if our competitors have a different mix of trade and non trade floor plan as compared to us 
in addition  we include all floor plan borrowings and repayments in our operating cash flow forecasts 
as a result  we use adjusted cash flow from operating activities to compare our results to forecasts

off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements during the years presented other than those disclosed in notes and of our consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting estimates preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting estimates described below are those that require management judgments  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
goodwill  manufacturer franchise rights and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess cost of the businesses acquired over the fair market value of the identifiable net assets 
we have determined that  based on how we integrate acquisitions into our business  how the components of our business share resources and interact with one another  and the fact that all components are economically similar  we qualify as a single reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
our dealership general managers are responsible for customer facing activities  including inventory management  advertising and personnel decisions  and have the flexibility to respond to local market conditions 
the corporate management team  with input from the regional management teams  is responsible for infrastructure and general strategy decisions 
the fair market value of our manufacturer franchise rights is determined at the acquisition date through discounting the projected cash flows specific to each franchise 
we have determined that manufacturer franchise 
table of contents rights have an indefinite life as there are no economic or other factors that limit their useful lives and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers brand names 
furthermore  to the extent that any agreements evidencing such manufacturer rights expire  we expect to renew those agreements in the ordinary course of business 
due to the fact that manufacturer franchise rights are specific to the location in which we acquire a dealership  we have determined that the dealership is the reporting unit for purposes of testing franchise rights for impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives 
we review goodwill and indefinite lived manufacturer franchise rights for impairment annually on october st of each year  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that manufacturer franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in fair market value of our individual franchises or to the extent that goodwill becomes impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of our automotive retail business 
in addition to the testing above  which is done at least on an annual basis  management uses certain indicators to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable  such as i current period operating or cash flow declines combined with a history of operating cash flow declines or a forecast that demonstrates continuing declines in the cash flow of an entity or inability of an entity to improve its operations to forecasted levels  ii a significant adverse change in the business climate  whether structural or technological  that could affect the value of an entity or iii whether the book value of our shareholders equity continues to be significantly in excess of our market capitalization 
we have determined that the recent economic conditions and the resulting impact on the automotive retailing industry  as well as the uncertainty surrounding the going concern of the domestic automobile manufacturers indicated the impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  the test for goodwill impairment  as defined by sfas no 
 is a two step approach 
in the first step of the impairment test  we determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
we calculated our estimated fair value used in the step one determination of fair value as the amount that we would receive in a sale of our company as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants as of december   using two valuation methods 
first  we used the quoted market price of our outstanding common shares at december   and added a control premium that is representative of i recent comparatively sized sale transactions and ii certain qualitative and quantitative macroeconomic conditions  including the current economic environment  which we believe impacted the quoted market price of our common stock 
second  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis using forward looking projections of our estimated future operating results 
based on the results of both valuation methods  we concluded that the fair value of our company was below the carrying value of our net assets at december  as a result  we proceeded to the second step  which involved an analysis reflecting the allocation of the fair value determined in the first step as if it were the purchase price in a business combination 
this process resulted in no allocation of fair value to goodwill 
the calculated fair value of the goodwill resulting from this allocation was therefore deemed to be zero and as a result we incurred a non cash impairment of million related to the decline in the value of our goodwill 
we do not have any goodwill remaining as of december  prior to our adoption on july   of sfas no 
 business combinations  and in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we did not separately identify franchise rights associated with the acquisition of dealerships as separate intangible assets 
in performing the second step  we were required by sfas no 
to assign value to these previously unrecognized identifiable intangible assets including such franchise rights even though such amounts were not separately identified on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents we determined that the fair market value of certain of our manufacturer franchise rights was below its carrying value 
we calculated the fair market value using a discounted projected cash flow analysis specific to each franchise 
the reduction in the fair market value was a result of lower projected cash flows and increased discount rates  which is reflective of the current economic environment 
as a result we recognized a million non cash impairment of manufacturer franchise rights 
as of december   we had million of manufacturer franchise rights remaining  primarily related to our luxury franchises  million of which were classified as assets held for sale 
the impairment expense associated with other intangible assets totaling million consisted primarily of miscellaneous intangible assets related to completed acquisitions 
impairment of long lived assets we identified potential impairment indicators related to certain of our real estate  after giving consideration to the likelihood that certain facilities would not be sold or used by a prospective buyer as an automobile dealership operation given current market conditions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we reviewed the carrying value of such assets compared to estimates of fair market values determined by third party appraisal and brokers opinions of value 
accordingly  we recorded an million non cash impairment of certain property and equipment 
f i chargeback reserve we receive commissions from the sale of vehicle service contracts  credit life insurance and disability insurance to customers 
in addition  we receive commissions from financing institutions for arranging customer financing 
we may be charged back chargebacks for finance  insurance or vehicle service contract commissions in the event a customer prepays or defaults on a retail sales contract or cancels an insurance or warranty contract 
the revenues from financing fees and commissions are recorded at the time the vehicles are sold and a reserve for future chargebacks is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
this data is evaluated on a product by product basis 
our loss histories vary depending on the product but generally range between and 
our f i chargebacks from continuing operations for the twelve months ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
our chargeback reserves were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
total chargebacks as a percentage of f i revenue for the twelve months ended december  and  were and  respectively 
a change in our estimate for all our products would have changed our finance and insurance  net by approximately million 
used vehicle inventory lower of cost or market reserves our used vehicle inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the specific identification method to value our vehicle inventories 
we maintain a reserve for specific inventory units where cost basis exceeds fair value 
in assessing lower of cost or market for used vehicles  we consider i the aging of used vehicles  ii loss histories of used vehicles and iii current market conditions 
our used light vehicle loss histories have indicated that our losses range between and of our used light vehicle inventory 
our used light vehicle losses for the twelve months ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   our used light vehicle loss reserve was million or of used light vehicle inventory 
as of december   our used light vehicle loss reserve was million  or of used light vehicle inventory 
as of december   each change in our estimate would change our used light vehicle reserve approximately million 
as a result of current market conditions our inventory reserves are at the highest percentage level in recent history 
if one or more vehicle manufacturers were to file for bankruptcy  we believe we would need to significantly increase our inventory reserves 

table of contents insurance reserves we are self insured for certain employee medical claims and maintain stop loss insurance for individual claims 
we have large deductible insurance programs in place for workers compensation  property and general liability claims 
we maintain and review at least monthly our claim and loss history to assist in assessing our future liability for these claims

reconciliation of non gaap financial information the following operating performance measure cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted is not a measure of operating performance under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for gaap profitability measures such as cash provided by operating activities 
this non gaap operating performance measure has material limitations and as a result should be evaluated in conjunction with the directly comparable gaap measure 
for example  these non gaap measures are not defined by gaap and our definition of each measure may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
other limitations of these non gaap measures are discussed below 
in order to compensate for these limitations  we also review the related gaap measures 
investors should not consider the non gaap measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under gaap 
cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to a party unaffiliated with the entity from which we purchase a particular new vehicle  and all floor plan notes payable relating to pre owned vehicles collectively referred to as floor plan notes payable non trade  are classified as financing activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  with borrowings reflected separately from repayments 
the net change in floor plan notes payable to a party affiliated with the entity from which we purchase new vehicles collectively referred to as floor plan notes payable trade is classified as an operating activity on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
borrowings of floor plan notes payable associated with inventory acquired in connection with all acquisitions are classified as a financing activity 
cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in operating activities differ from cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in financing activities only to the extent that the former are cash flows related to amounts payable to a lender affiliated with the entity from which we purchased the related inventory while the latter are cash flows related to amounts payable to a lender not affiliated with the entity from which we purchased the related inventory 
floor plan borrowings are required by all vehicle manufacturers for the purchase of new vehicles  and all floor plan providers require amounts borrowed for the purchase of a vehicle to be repaid immediately after the related vehicle is sold 
as a result  we believe that it is important to understand the relationship between the cash flows of all of our floor plan notes payable and new vehicle inventory in order to understand our working capital and operating cash flow and to be able to compare our operating cash flow to that of our competitors ie  if our competitors have a different mix of trade and non trade floor plan as compared to us 
in addition  we include all floor plan borrowings and repayments in our operating cash flow forecasts 
as a result  we use adjusted cash flow from operating activities to compare our results to forecasts 
we believe that by splitting the cash flows of floor plan notes payable between operating activities and financing activities while all new vehicle inventory activity is included in operating activities results in significantly different operating cash flow than when all the cash flows of floor plan notes payable are classified together in operating activities 
the non gaap measure cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted has material limitations 
cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted includes borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to lenders not affiliated with the entity from which we purchase the related vehicle

in order to compensate for these limitations we also review the related gaap measures 
we have provided a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities  as if all changes in floor plan notes payable  except for i borrowings associated with acquisitions and repayments associated with divestitures and ii borrowings and repayments associated with the purchase of used vehicle inventory  were classified as an operating activity

although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future floor plan credits  it is our expectation  based on historical data that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers
