some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are set forth herein in item a  risk factors  of this report and elsewhere in this report 
all forward looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this annual report are made as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statement or reason why actual results may differ 
control deficiencies we restated pericom s consolidated financial statements for its first  second and third fiscal quarters ended september   december   and march   and are filing amended forms q for those periods reflecting the restated information 
as a result of the errors leading to the restatement  we have concluded in item a of this report that our internal control over financial reporting as of our fiscal year end at june   was not effective 
we also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of that date  and as of the end of those three quarterly periods  were not effective 
information concerning the restatement is contained in the following sections of this report and should be read in conjunction with the information reported under this item part ii  item a  controls and procedures  and part i  item a  risk factors  we and our independent registered public accounting firm determined that we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our most recent fiscal year  june  there can be no assurance that a material weakness will not arise in the future 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
and our finance department has undergone  and continues to undergo  significant changes 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be reasonable given the circumstances 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company to make its most difficult and subjective accounting judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances  which impact the recording of revenues  valuation of inventories  which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins  accounting for income taxes  which impacts the income tax provision and net income  impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and investments  which impacts the goodwill  intangible asset and investment accounts  and share based compensation  which impacts costs of goods sold and operating expenses 
these policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further below 
we also have other important policies that we discuss in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products in conformity with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab no 

accordingly  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  the company meets these conditions upon shipment because  in most cases  title and risk of loss passes to the customer at that time 
in addition  the company estimates and records provisions for future returns and other charges against revenue at the time of shipment 
for some of our products  notably our fcps that we manufacture in taiwan  we recognize revenue upon delivery for taiwan sales and for foreign sales  days after shipment 
our sales terms for fcp are usually fob shipping point and we use federal express fedex for all of our deliveries 
fedex delivers shipments within one day to taiwanese customers and within days for customers outside of taiwan 
we sell products to both large domestic and international distributors 
we sell our products to domestic distributors at the price listed in our price book for that distributor 
at the time of shipment  we book a sales reserve for the entire amount if the customer has the right to return the product 
in addition  at the time of sale we book a sales reserve for ship from stock and debits ssd s  stock rotation amounts expected to be returned  return material authorizations rma s  authorized price protection programs  and any special programs approved by management 
these sales reserves offset revenues  which produces the net revenues amount we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the market price for our products can be significantly different from the book price at which we sold the product to the distributor 
when the market price  as compared with the book price  of a particular sales opportunity from our distributor to their customer would result in low or negative margins to our distributor  we negotiate a ship from stock and debit with the distributor 
we analyze our ssd history and use the history to develop ssd rates that form the basis of the ssd sales reserve we record each period 
we use historical ssd rates to estimate the ultimate net sales price to the distributor 
our distribution agreements provide for semi annual stock rotation privileges of typically of net sales for the previous six month period 
the contractual stock rotation applies only to shipments at book price 
asian distributors typically buy our product at less than book price and therefore are not entitled to the stock rotation privilege 
in order to provide for routine inventory refreshing  for our benefit as well as theirs  we typically grant asian distributors stock rotation privileges between and even though we are not contractually obligated to do so 
each month we record a sales reserve for the estimated stock rotation privilege anticipated to be utilized by our distributors that month 
from time to time  customers may request to return parts for various reasons including the customers belief that the parts are not performing to specification 
many such return requests are the result of customers incorrectly using the parts  not because the parts are defective 
our management reviews these requests and  if approved  we establish a rma 
we are only obligated to accept returns of defective parts 
for customer convenience  we may approve a particular return request  even though we are not obligated to do so 
each month  we record a sales reserve for the approved rmas that have not yet been returned 
in the past  we have not kept a general warranty reserve because historically valid warranty returns  which are the result of a part not meeting specifications or being non functional  have been immaterial and frequently we can resell parts to other customers for use in other applications 
we monitor and assess rma activity and overall materiality to assess whether a general warranty reserve has become appropriate 
we grant price protection solely at the discretion of our management 
the purpose of price protection is to reduce our distributors cost of inventory as market prices fall  which reduces our ssd rates 
our sales management team prepares price protection proposals for individual products located at individual distributors 
our general management reviews these proposals and if a particular price protection arrangement is approved  we estimate the dollar impact based on the book price reduction per unit for the products approved and the number of units of those products in that distributor s inventory 
we record a sales reserve in that period for the estimated amount at the time revenue is recognized 
reserves for price protection were increased approximately million in  an amount well above normal reserve increases which average approximately  annually 
this reflects the economic conditions and competitive situations that we faced in fiscal at the discretion of our management  we may offer rebates on specific products sold to specific end customers 
the purpose of the rebates is to allow for pricing adjustments for large programs without affecting the pricing we charge our distributor customers 
we record the customer s rebate at the time of shipment 
customers are typically granted payment terms of between and days and they generally pay within those terms 
we grant relatively few customers any sales terms that include cash discounts 
we invoice our distributors for shipments at our listed book price 
when our distributors pay those invoices  they may claim debits for ssds  stock rotations  cash discounts  rmas and price protection when appropriate 
once claimed  we confirm these debits are in line with our management s prior authorizations and reduce the reserve we previously established for that customer 
the revenue we record for sales to our distributors is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current trends and other related factors 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and in banks and all highly liquid debt investments with a time to maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase 
short and long term investments 
our policy is to invest excess funds in instruments with investment grade credit ratings 
we classify our investments as available for sale  trading or held to maturity 
further  we classify our trading securities as current assets and our available for sale securities as either current or non current based on the specific attributes of each security 
we recognize unrealized gains and losses in our trading securities in current earnings  and unrealized gains and losses in our available for sale securities as an increase or reduction in shareholders equity 
we report our trading and available for sale securities at their fair values 
we evaluate our available for sale securities for impairment quarterly 
we recognize impairment losses on other than temporary declines in the value of investments in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which we discover the impairment 
we have also made other investments including loans  bridge loans convertible to equity or asset purchases as well as direct equity investments 
we make these loans and investments with strategic intentions and  historically  are in privately held technology companies  which by their nature are high risk 
these investments are included in other assets in the balance sheet and we carry them at the lower of cost  or market if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we monitor these investments quarterly and make appropriate reductions in carrying value if we deem a decline in value is other than temporary 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors 
we record a specific allowance in cases where we become aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to pay fully their financial obligation to us 
for all other customers  we recognize an allowance based on the length of time the receivable balances are past due  based on the current economic environment and our historical experience 
inventories 
for our ic and certain fcp products we record inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we adjust the carrying value of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory based on inventory age  shipment history and our forecast of demand over a specific future period 
the semiconductor markets that we serve are volatile and actual results may vary from our forecast or other assumptions  potentially affecting our assessment of excess and obsolete inventory resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
we record the inventories of the remainder of our fcp products at the lower of weighted average cost which approximates actual cost or market value 
weighted average cost is comprised of average manufacturing costs weighted by the volume produced in each production run 
we define market value as the net realizable value for our finished goods and replacement cost for raw materials and work in process 
we consider raw material inventory slow moving and we write it down to zero if it has not moved in days 
for assembled devices  we disaggregate the inventory by part number 
we compare the quantities on hand in each part number category to the quantity we shipped in the previous twelve months  the quantity in backlog and to the quantity we expect to ship in the next twelve months 
we write down to zero the value of each quantity on hand that is in excess of the lesser of the three comparisons 
we believe our method of evaluating our inventory fairly represents market conditions 
we consider the material written off to be available for sale 
we do not revalue the written off inventory should market conditions change or if a market develops for the obsolete inventory 
in the past  we have sold obsolete inventory that we have previously written off as worthless 
refer to the gross profit discussion in this item of our annual report on form k for further discussion of sales of our obsolete inventory 
property  plant and equipment 
we record our property  plant and equipment at cost and depreciate the cost over the estimated useful lives of each asset classification  ranging between and years 
cost includes purchase cost  applicable taxes  freight  installation costs and interest incurred in the acquisition of any asset that requires a period of time to make it ready for use 
in addition  we capitalize the cost of major replacements  improvements and betterments  while we expense normal maintenance and repair 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we hold ownership interests in various investees 
our ownership in these affiliates varies from to approximately  which we classify as investments in unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated balance sheets 
we account for long term investments in companies in which we have an ownership share larger than and in which we have significant influence over the activities of the investee using the equity method 
we recognize our proportionate share of each investee s income or loss in the period in which the investee reports the income or loss 
we eliminate all intercompany transactions in accounting for our equity method investments 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we determined that no impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets existed at june  we also evaluate other definite lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we determined that no impairment of these other definite lived intangible assets existed at june  income taxes 
we account for income taxes using sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach to recording deferred taxes 
our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that will result in deductible amounts in future years  including net operating loss carry forwards 
based on estimates  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
if  in the future  we experiences losses for a sustained period of time  we may not be able to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
if this occurs  we may be required to increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
overview we incorporated pericom semiconductor corporation in june in california 
we completed our first profitable fiscal year on june  we design  manufacture and market high performance digital  analog and mixed signal integrated circuits ics and frequency control products fcps used for the transfer  routing and timing of digital and analog signals within and between computer  networking  data communications and telecommunications systems 
our first volume sales occurred in fiscal and consisted exclusively of volt bit interface logic circuits 
we have introduced new products to the market every year since we produced our first shipments 
in recent years  we have expanded our product offering by introducing the following products  among others in fiscal  the production availability of gen pci express signal switches and a high performance  zero delay gen clock buffer family  the first in the industry  enabling the design of ultra high speed gbps gen pci express serial connectivity systems  the pcie to pci x bridge for target applications including server  hba  storage  nic cards  video and gaming  networking and telecommunications  one clock synthesizer  two lvpecl differential clocks  three spread spectrum clock generators  three clock buffers  five low phase noise vcxo s  eight new hdmi  four analog video and two high speed usb switches to penetrate target applications including gigabit ethernet networking switch  digital tv  set top box  cell phone  mp mp player and pda  in fiscal  a total of new products across our timing  signal conditioning  and connectivity product areas  including industry first signal conditioning products specifically designed to meet the stringent specifications of the new  high speed pci express gen gb s  and sata sas gb s protocols  products which have become enabling technology by allowing system designers to maintain critical signal integrity within next generation platforms  industry first display port switches and level shifters  which help enable adoption of the new protocol  in the area of pci express  the industry s first pcie bridge and packet switch products in low cost  small size bga and qfp packages  which help enable the use of pci express in volume platforms such as notebook  docking station  digital tv  and multi function soho printers mfp  and new timing products including industry first extremely low jitter clock oscillators specifically designed for the new pci express gen specification  and in fiscal  pericom introduced a total of new products across our timing  signal conditioning  and connectivity product areas  including industry leading or industry first product introductions eight new timing products including one jitter cleaner product  four clock generators buffers for pcie  networking and ultramobility applications  and three multi product families of oscillators the m  xp  and fd series 
the xp oscillators are an industry first hybrid technology providing a high performance  high frequency timing reference for sas  gpon  gigabit ethernet serial connectivity standards  while the fd series oscillators provide a very low jitter  low power  small size solution for hard disk drive and wireless applications 
eight new signal conditioning products including sata  display port  sas  and pcie gen including an industry first pcisig compliant pcie gb s redriver  an industry first esata gb s redriver  and a first to market display port redriver 
twenty four new connectivity products  including usb  display port  pcie  hdmi  ethernet  and lvds switches  and pcie bridges and packet switches including the industry s smallest low power pcie packet switch 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we expect selling prices for our products to decline over the life of each product 
our ability to increase net revenues is highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of existing products 
in order to have sufficient supply for increased unit sales  we seek to increase the wafer fabrication capacity allocations from our existing foundries  qualify new foundries  increase the number of die per wafer through die size reductions and improve the yields of good die through the implementation of advanced process technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
magnachip and chartered manufactured approximately to of the wafers for our semiconductor products in fiscal years  and  with the balance coming from between three and six other suppliers 
declining selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with the sale of new  higher margin products or achieve commensurate reductions in unit costs 
we seek to improve our overall gross margin through the development and introduction of selected new products that we believe will ultimately achieve higher gross margins 
a higher gross margin for a new product is typically not achieved until some period after the initial introduction of the product after start up expenses for that product have been incurred and once volume production begins 
in general  costs are higher at the introduction of a new product due to the use of a more generalized design schematic  lower economy of scale in the assembly phase and lower die yield 
our ability to reduce unit cost depends on our ability to shrink the die sizes of our products  improve yields  obtain favorable subcontractor pricing and make in house manufacturing operations more productive and efficient 
there can be no assurance that these efforts  even if successful  will be sufficient to offset declining selling prices 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended june  june  june  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net interese expense other than temporary decline in value of investment income before income taxes income tax provision minority interest in income loss of consolidated subsidiaries equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates net income comparison of fiscal  and net revenues the following table sets forth our revenues and the customer concentrations with respect to such revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended fiscal year ended june  june  june  june  in thousands change change net revenues percentage of net revenues accounted for by top direct customers number of direct customers that each account for more than of net revenues percentage of net revenues accounted for by top end customers number of end customers that each account for more than of net revenues direct customers purchase products directly from the company 
these customers include distributors and contract manufacturers that in turn sell to many end customers as well as oems that also purchase directly from the company 
end customers are oems whose products include the company s products 
end customers may purchase directly from the company or from distributors or contract manufacturers 
for end customer sales data  we rely on the end customer data provided by our direct distribution and contract manufacturing customers 
net revenues consist of product sales  which we generally recognize upon shipment  less an estimate for returns and allowances 
our order backlog stood at million as of june  and million as of june  we expect to fulfill most of our backlogged orders as of june  within the first quarter of fiscal we remain heavily reliant on orders that book and ship in the same quarter turns orders 
our reliance on turns orders  the uncertain strength of our end markets and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy make it difficult to predict near term demand 
net revenue decreased million or in fiscal versus primarily as the result of a decrease in the sales of analog switch products to million  a decrease of million  a decrease of million or in sales of our fcp product family to million  and sales decreases in digital switch  interface and clock ic products  which combined for a million sales decrease  partially offset by a million increase in connect ic products to million 
these sales increases and decreases are primarily the result of changes in unit sales volumes of existing products as well as the introduction and sale of new products 
for the years ended june  and june   net revenue was reduced by sales reserves for price protection and rebates in the amount of million and  respectively 
the increased reserves were a consequence of the economic downturn and customers increasingly demanding price concessions 
net revenue increased million or in fiscal versus primarily as the result of a increase in the sales of analog switch products to million  an increase of million  an increase of million or in sales of our fcp product family to million  and continued sales growth in digital switch  interface  clock  and connect ic products  which combined for a million sales increase 
these sales increases are the result primarily of increased unit sales volumes of existing products as well as the introduction and sale of new products 
for the years ended june  and june   net revenue included sales reserves for price protection and rebates in the amount of  and  respectively 
in the future  market conditions could become more difficult as other companies compete more aggressively for business 
pricing for our higher margin analog switch  clock and connect products  many of which are proprietary  is more stable and new product introductions and cost reductions generally offset price declines 
the following table sets forth net revenues by country as a percentage of total net revenues for the fiscal years ended june   june  and june  years ended june  june  june  in thousands net sales to countries taiwan china including hong kong united states singapore others less than each total net sales over the past three years  sales to taiwan and china have increased  from of total net sales in the year ended june   to in the year ended june   to in the year ended june  this shift reflects both sre s operations and manufacturing migration to asia 
sre derives its revenue primarily from customers in taiwan and china 
in addition  we are shipping an increasing number of products to asia  especially taiwan and china  where an increasing volume of contract manufacturing work occurs 
we expect our future sales to continue to grow  as a percentage of net revenues  in taiwan and china in future periods 
as the migration of assembly operations to asia continues  we expect our net revenues from sales in north america to decline  as they have during fiscal and gross profit fiscal year ended fiscal year ended june  june  june  june  in thousands change change net revenues gross profit gross profit percentage the million decrease in gross profit in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to sales declines in all lines except connect ic  resulting in a million reduction in gross profit  reduced margins in all lines as a result of competitive markets and underutilized capacity  reducing gross profit by approximately million  partially offset by sales growth in connect ic  which increased gross profit by approximately million 
with respect to the increase in gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal of million  the increase is the result of sales growth in analog switches  which generated million increased gross profit  increased sales of the fcp product family  which contributed million of additional gross profit  and improved margins in ic products  which added million gross profit 
during fiscal years  and  gross profits and gross margins benefited from the sale of inventory  previously valued at   and  respectively  that we had previously identified as excess and written off 
future gross profit and gross margin are highly dependent on the level and product mix included in net revenues 
this includes the mix of sales between lower margin fcp products and our higher margin integrated circuit products 
although we have been successful at favorably improving our integrated circuit product mix and penetrating new end markets  there can be no assurance that this will continue 
accordingly  we are not able to predict future gross profit levels or gross margins with certainty 
research and development fiscal year ended fiscal year ended june  june  june  june  in thousands change change net revenues research and development r d as a percentage of net revenues research and development r d expenses consist primarily of costs related to personnel and overhead  non recurring engineering charges and other costs associated with the design  prototyping and testing of new product concepts  manufacturing process support and customer applications support 
the  expense decrease for fiscal as compared with fiscal is attributable primarily to decreases of  in compensation related expenses including those for stock compensation  with the savings primarily in mandatory shutdown days and reduced bonus accruals  and decreases of  in use of outside design consultants  partially offset by increased expenditures of  for engineering masks and  for software maintenance 
the million expense increase for fiscal as compared with fiscal is attributable primarily to increases of  in compensation  reflecting merit increases  bonus  and staff additions from to employees  and  in design and other consultant expenditures 
we believe that continued investment in research and development to develop new products and improve manufacturing processes is critical to our success and  consequently  we expect to increase research and development expenses in future periods over the long term 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year ended fiscal year ended june  june  june  june  in thousands change change net revenues selling  general and administrative sg a as a percentage of net revenues selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  administration  human resources and general management 
the  expense decrease for fiscal as compared with fiscal is attributable primarily to decreases of  in product sample and mailing expenses   in outside sales rep commissions   in travel and entertainment expenses and  in temporary labor  partially offset by increases of  in compensation related expenses  primarily higher salaries and wages and stock compensation expenses 
the million expense increase for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to increased personnel expense of  increased share based compensation expense of  increased product sample and mailing expenses of  and an increase of  in recruiting expenditures 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase significantly in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year due to an estimated million to million of accounting  legal and other costs related to the delayed filing of this report  the restatement and other matters described in item a of this report 
we further anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as we add to our support and administrative staff  particularly in sales and marketing  and as we face increasing commission expense to the extent we achieve higher sales levels 
in addition  we believe continuing compliance with sarbanes oxley section and remediation of our material weaknesses will be a significant expense 
we intend to continue to focus on controlling selling  general and administrative expenses 
restructuring charge in fiscal  the company instituted a restructuring plan to align its costs with prevailing market conditions 
as part of the restructuring plan  the company reduced its workforce by employees  with in operations  in research and development  in sales and marketing  and in general and administration 
the company incurred  of restructuring charges in the year ended june   as compared with none in the year ended june  at june    of the  had been paid with the balance expected to be paid over the next six months 
the plan was implemented over the second and third quarters of fiscal  with full savings benefits of approximately  per quarter realized beginning in the fourth quarter 
the benefits arose from reduced salaries and wages  commissions and bonus  and travel and entertainment expenses  and were predominantly realized in operating expenses 
these benefits are expected to continue into fiscal  although we expect that they will eventually be eroded as the economy recovers and we anticipate we may require additional resources to meet increasing demand 
interest and other income  net fiscal year ended fiscal year ended june  june  june  june  in thousands change change net revenues interest income other income expense n m  n m total interest and other income  net interest and other income  net as a percentage of net revenues n m means not meaningful 
the decrease in interest income for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily the result of an approximately reduction on average in the amount of short and long term investments in marketable securities in as compared with  partially offset by a million increase in realized gains from the sale of investment securities 
other income expense for fiscal and primarily result from an exchange rate gain and loss  respectively 
the increase in interest income for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily the result of  in realized gains from the sale of investment securities 
other income expense for fiscal primarily results from an exchange rate loss as the us dollar weakened approximately against the new taiwan dollar  while in fiscal other income benefited from the gain of million resulting from the sale of of an investment in a privately held semiconductor company 
interest expense interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as the company s ptl subsidiary acquired its headquarters building with mortgage financing 
interest expense was reduced to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as outstanding debt was retired in the first half of the fiscal year 
other than temporary decline in value of investment other than temporary decline in value of investment increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily because of a  decline in the value of an investment security 
the  charge was for an other than temporary impairment of a marketable debt security held in our short term investment portfolio 
this resulted from the issuing company filing for chapter bankruptcy protection 
the company s investment guidelines require a diversified portfolio of investment grade instruments  and it is unlikely that any future impairments would be material to the company s liquidity and financial position 
provision for income taxes fiscal year ended fiscal year ended june  june  june  june  in thousands change change pre tax income income tax provision effective tax rate our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  the effect of foreign income tax and foreign losses  the utilization of research and development tax credits and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate for fiscal decreased from fiscal primarily due to reduced state income taxes  net of federal benefit  reduced foreign income and withholding taxes and increased research and development tax credits 
the effective tax rate for fiscal increased from fiscal primarily due to increased state income taxes  net of federal benefit  reduced research and development tax credits and unfavorable change in the valuation allowance 
a reconciliation of our tax rates for fiscal years  and is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report on form k 
minority interest for the year ended june   net minority interest in income of our consolidated subsidiaries  ptl and sre  was  we acquired the minority interest of ptl during the year

equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates fiscal year ended fiscal year ended june  june  june  june  in thousands change change equity in net income of pti equity in net income of jcp equity in net losses of other investees total equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates includes our allocated portion of the net income of pericom technology  inc pti  a british virgin islands corporation based in shanghai  people s republic of china and hong kong 
pericom and certain pericom shareholders formed pti in to develop and market semiconductors in china and certain other asian countries 
we account for our investment in pti using the equity method of accounting 
we have invested in pti using several different transactions over a period of years 
initially  pti generated losses which were attributable to each of the various rounds of financing and we accounted for those losses using our percentage of each round of financing until our investment was exhausted 
when pti began showing gains  we recouped our losses against each of the rounds 
during fiscal  and most of we accounted for our equity in pti following our ownership of pti s series a preferred stock  but in the fourth quarter we reverted to using our overall ownership position as the series a investment recovery was completed  thus completing the recuperation of all previously recorded losses 
our allocated portion of pti s results increased to income of  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal  and  in fiscal equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates also includes the company s allocated portion of the net income of jiyuan crystal photoelectric frequency technology ltd 
jcp  an fcp manufacturing company located in science park of jiyuan city  henan province  china 
jcp is a key manufacturing partner of sre  and sre has acquired a equity interest in jcp 
for fiscal  the company s allocated portion of jcp s results was income of  as compared with  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   our principal sources of liquidity included continuing operations as well as cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments of approximately million  as compared with million as of june  and million as of june  in fiscal  and  we made no acquisitions of other companies 
as of june   we owned assets classified as cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million as of june  and million as of june  the maturities of our short term investments are staggered throughout the year to ensure we meet our cash requirements 
because we are primarily a fabless semiconductor manufacturer  we have lower capital equipment requirements than other semiconductor manufacturers that own fabrication foundries fabs 
during the fiscal year  we purchased million of property and equipment as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively

sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a non controlling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the non controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its non controlling interest 
the provisions of sfas are effective for the fiscal year beginning june  and the presentation and disclosure requirements must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented at that date

item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure at june   the company s investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  of million see note of notes to financial statements 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
we could realize a loss on these securities if we were forced to sell them in a period when interest rates are higher than current rates 
we do not expect such a scenario to occur 
for example  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   such as from to  the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would be approximately million 
on the other hand  if interest rates were to decline the effect on our portfolio would be in the opposite direction 
the company transacts business in various non us currencies  primarily the new taiwan dollar and the japanese yen 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable from sales in these foreign currencies and the net monetary assets and liabilities of the related foreign subsidiary 
a hypothetical unfavorable change in the foreign currency exchange rate would reduce cash by approximately  as those monetary assets are converted to cash
