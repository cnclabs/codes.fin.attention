the services we offer across all the markets we serve include printed circuit board and flexible circuit fabrication  systems assembly and manufacturing  logistics  after sales services  design and engineering services  original design manufacturing odm services  and components design and manufacturing 
we believe that the combination of our extensive design and engineering services  significant scale and global presence  vertically integrated end to end services  advanced supply chain management  industrial campuses in low cost geographic areas and operational track record provide us with a competitive advantage in the market for designing  manufacturing and servicing electronics products for leading multinational and regional oems 
through these services and facilities  we simplify the global product development and manufacturing process and provide meaningful time to market and cost savings for our oem customers 
industry overview historically  the ems industry experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elected to outsource some or all of their design  manufacturing  and distribution requirements 
following the technology downturn  we saw an increase in penetration of global oem manufacturing requirements as more and more oems pursued the benefits of outsourcing rather than internal manufacturing 
as a result of macroeconomic conditions  the global economic crisis and related decline in demand for our customers products  many of our oem customers have reduced their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing which has negatively impacted our capacity utilization levels 
despite the current economic downturn  we believe the long term  future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities  design and engineering services and after market services remain strong 
the total available market for outsourcing electronics manufacturing services continues to offer opportunities for growth with current penetration rates estimated to be less than 
the intensely competitive nature of the electronics industry  the continually increasing complexity and sophistication of electronics products  pressure on oems to reduce product costs  and shorter product life cycles encourage oems to utilize ems providers as part of their business and manufacturing strategies 
utilizing ems providers allows oems to take advantage of the global design  manufacturing and supply chain management expertise of ems providers  and enables oems to concentrate on product research  development  marketing and sales 
we believe that oems realize the following benefits through their strategic relationships with ems providers reduced production costs  reduced design and development costs  accelerated time to market and time to volume production  reduced capital investment requirements and fixed costs  
table of contents improved inventory management and purchasing power  access to worldwide design  engineering  manufacturing  and logistics capabilities  and ability to focus on core branding and r d initiatives 
we believe that growth in the ems industry will be driven largely by the needs of oems to respond to rapidly changing markets and technologies and to reduce product costs 
additionally  we believe that there are significant opportunities for ems providers to win additional business from oems in certain markets or industry segments that have yet to substantially utilize ems providers 
service offerings we offer a broad range of customer tailored  vertically integrated services to oems 
we believe that flextronics has the broadest worldwide capabilities in the ems industry  from design resources to end to end  vertically integrated  global supply chain services 
we believe a key competitive advantage is our ability to provide more value and innovation to our customers because we offer both global economies of scale in manufacturing  logistics and procurement  as well as market focused expertise and capabilities in design  engineering and odm services 
as a result of our focus on specific markets  we believe we are able to better understand complex market dynamics and anticipate trends that impact our oem customers businesses  and can help improve their market positioning by effectively adjusting product plans and roadmaps to deliver low cost  high quality products and meet their time to market requirements 
our vertically integrated services allow us to design  build  ship and service a complete packaged product to our oem customers 
these services include printed circuit board pcb and flexible circuit fabrication 
printed circuit boards are platforms composed of laminated materials that provide the interconnection for integrated circuits  passive and other electronic components and thus are at the heart of most every electrical system 
they are formed out of laminated  flame retardant and multi layered epoxy resin systems with very fine traces and spaces and plated holes called vias  which interconnect the different layers to an extreme dense circuitry network that carries the integrated circuits and electrical signals 
semiconductor designs are currently so complex that they often require printed circuit boards with multiple layers of narrow  densely spaced wiring or flexible circuits 
as semiconductor designs become more and more complex and signal speeds increase there is an increased demand on printed circuit board integration density requiring higher layer counts  finer lines  smaller vias microvias and base materials with electrically very low loss characteristics 
the manufacture of these complex multilayer interconnect and flexible circuit products often requires the use of sophisticated circuit interconnections between layers  and adherence to strict electrical characteristics to maintain consistent circuit transmission speeds 
the global demand for wireless devices and the complexity of wireless products are driving the demand for more flexible printed circuits as the flexible circuit board facilitates a reduction in the weight of a finished electronic product 
additionally  flexible printed circuit boards allows for the elimination of bulky connections and wiring  reduces the number of components and expands the boundaries of design and packaging with its ability to fold 
we also provide complete printed circuit board design services  incorporating high layer counts  advanced materials  component miniaturization technologies  signal integrity and rigid flex requirements 
we are an industry leader in high density  multilayer and flexible printed circuit board manufacturing 
we also provide our customers with rigid flex circuit board design and manufacturing 
we manufacture printed circuit boards on a low volume  quick turn basis  as well as on a high volume production basis 
we provide quick turn prototype services that allow us to provide small test quantities to meet the needs of customers product development groups in as little as hours
