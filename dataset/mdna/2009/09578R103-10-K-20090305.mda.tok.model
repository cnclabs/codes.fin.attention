item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the heading item a 
risk factors 
management overview about blue nile incorporated in  blue nile is a leading online retailer of diamonds and fine jewelry that offers an exceptional customer experience  including substantial education  guidance and value 
we have successfully built blue nile into a premium brand 
our long term financial focus is primarily on sustainable growth in free cash flow non gaap free cash flow is primarily driven by increasing our operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures 
increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites  improvements in operating margins and the efficient management of operating costs  offset by the investments that we make in longer term strategic initiatives 
differentiating factors and value proposition we have built an innovative business model that delivers exceptional value and service to customers 
we have developed relationships with a large number of independent vendors with whom we have exclusive agreements as an online retailer 
our unique inventory model allows us to offer our customers access to an enormous selection of high quality diamonds 
in most cases  we purchase diamonds from our suppliers only when a customer has ordered them from us 
as a result  we do not incur the significant costs typically associated with carrying high levels of diamond inventory in physical retail 
as an online retailer  we also do not incur most of the operating costs associated with physical retail stores  including occupancy costs and related overhead 
as a result  while our gross profit margins are lower than those typically maintained by traditional diamond and fine jewelry retailers  we are able to realize relatively higher operating income as a percentage of net sales 
in the year ended january   we had a gross profit margin  as compared to what we believe to be gross profit margins of up to or more by some traditional retailers 
our lower gross profit margins result from lower retail prices that we offer to our customers 
we believe that these lower prices  in turn  will result in increasing our market share in the luxury jewelry retail space 
our efficient operating model provides for negative working capital benefits 
payments are received from customers within a few days of their orders  but our vendor payment terms are typically in the day range 
we have an obsessive focus on the customer 
we develop our websites to offer easy to understand  step by step guides to visualizing  evaluating  selecting and purchasing diamonds and fine jewelry 
our customer support centers are staffed with non commissioned product experts who offer advice and guidance to customers 
we continue to invest in optimizing our fulfillment operations to ensure that our customized products can be delivered within approximately three business days of order 
customer feedback and customer satisfaction ratings are among the key non financial measures we review 
we believe that maintaining high overall customer satisfaction is critical to our ongoing efforts to promote the blue nile brand and to increase our net sales and net income 
we actively solicit customer blue nile defines free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  as net cash provided by used in operating activities less cash outflows for purchases of fixed assets  including internal use software and website development 

table of contents feedback on our website functionality as well as on the entire purchase experience 
to maintain a high level of performance by our diamond and jewelry consultants  we also undertake an ongoing customer feedback process 
seasonality we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products 
our quarterly sales are impacted by various gift giving holidays including valentine s day first quarter  mother s day second quarter and christmas new year s fourth quarter 
as a result  our quarterly revenue is typically lowest in the third quarter as a result of the lack of recognized gift giving holidays and highest in the fourth quarter 
future growth opportunities a customer s first purchase from blue nile is often an engagement ring 
our goal is to provide an unrivaled customer experience such that we become our customers jeweler for life 
we have continued to expand our product lines to include non engagement diamond jewelry as well as other products such as pearls  gemstones and various silver  gold and platinum offerings 
our satisfied customers are also an important source of referrals that will help drive future growth 
we intend to selectively pursue opportunities in international markets in which we can leverage our existing infrastructure and compelling value proposition 
to date  we have launched sites offering local currency pricing in the uk and canada 
in  we expanded our website offerings to include shipment to over additional countries and territories throughout the world 
we will prioritize and pursue future opportunities based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  each market s consumer spending on jewelry  adoption rate of online purchasing and overall competitive landscape 
trends in  global economic and financial market conditions weakened  creating uncertainty for consumers 
this macroeconomic downturn has had a significant impact on consumer spending  most notably on purchases of high ticket items  including jewelry 
it is uncertain how long the current challenging economic conditions will continue 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make certain estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following are the critical accounting policies that we believe require significant estimation and management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue and the related gross profit on the date on which ownership passes from blue nile to our customers 
for us  canadian and uk customers  this is at the time the package is received by the customer 
for other customers  ownership passes at the time the product is shipped 
as we require customer payment prior to order shipment  any payments received prior to the transfer of ownership are not recorded as revenue 
for us  canadian and us shipments  we utilize our freight vendors tracking information to determine when delivery has occurred  which is typically within one to three days after shipment 
we reduce revenue by a provision for returns  which is based on our historical product return rates and current economic conditions 
our contracts with our suppliers generally allow us to return diamonds purchased and returned by our customers 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r 
we use the black scholes merton option valuation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term expected volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of employee stock options and consequently  the related amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
we performed the following sensitivity analysis using changes in the expected term and expected volatility that could be reasonably possible in the near term 
if we assumed a six month increase or decrease in the expected term or a basis point increase or decrease in expected volatility  the value of a newly granted hypothetical stock option would increase decrease by the following percentages increase decrease expected term expected volatility sensitivity to change in assumptions was determined using the black scholes merton valuation model compared to the following original assumptions stock price and exercise price equal to the closing market price of blue nile  inc common stock on january   expected term of years  expected volatility of  expected dividend yield of and a risk free interest rate of 
results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales year ended year ended year ended january  december  december  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income the following describes certain line items set forth in our consolidated statement of operations net sales 
substantially all of our net sales consist of diamonds and fine jewelry sold via the internet  net of estimated returns 
historically  net sales have been higher in the fourth quarter as a result of higher consumer spending during the holiday season 
we expect this seasonal trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
gross profit 
our gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold to customers  inbound and outbound shipping costs  depreciation on assembly related assets  insurance on shipments and the costs incurred to set diamonds into ring  earring and pendant settings  including labor and related facilities costs 
our gross profit has fluctuated historically and we expect it to continue to fluctuate based primarily on our product acquisition costs  product mix and pricing decisions 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefit costs for our employees  stock based compensation  marketing costs and credit card fees 
these expenses also include certain facility related costs  fulfillment  customer service  technology and depreciation expenses  as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
fiscal year 
the company s fiscal year generally ends on the sunday closest to december each fiscal year consists of four week quarters  with one extra week added in the fourth quarter every five to six years 
our fiscal year included one extra week in the fourth quarter  or weeks for the fiscal year  as a result of our retail reporting calendar 
the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated  including a comparison of the financial results for the periods indicated dollars in thousands  except per share data comparison of comparison of year ended year ended january  to december  to year ended year ended year ended year ended year ended january  december  december  december  december  change change change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income  net interest income  net other income  net nm income before income taxes income tax expense net income basic net income per share diluted net income per share nm not meaningful fiscal year consists of weeks comparison of year ended january  to year ended december  net sales net sales decreased in the year ended january   compared with the year ended december  excluding the additional week of sales included in the year ended january   net sales would have decreased approximately when compared to the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was due to a decrease in the number of orders shipped to customers  partially offset by an increase in the average retail value per order shipped 
in  our sales were significantly impacted by the extensive weakening of the us and global economies  which has had a severe impact on consumer spending  particularly for luxury products such as jewelry 

table of contents our sales were also impacted by rising prices for diamonds 
we purchase diamonds on a just in time basis from our suppliers when a customer places an order for a specific diamond 
as diamond pricing in the overall market rises and falls  we generally adjust our retail prices to take these price changes into account 
this results in us passing along price increases or decreases to customers more quickly than traditional retailers that maintain larger inventories 
as a result  our sales can be impacted negatively in a rising price environment for diamonds 
similarly  we believe we are at a competitive advantage in a declining price environment for diamonds  as our business model allows us to pass on lower prices to consumers on a real time basis more quickly than traditional retailers 
world diamond prices increased throughout much of  but started to decline late in the fourth quarter 
our international sales are defined as products sold through our us  uk and canadian websites and delivered to customers outside the us international sales were million for the year ended january   comprising of sales  compared to million for the year ended december   comprising of total sales 
in  we began offering our products for sale through our websites to over new countries and territories throughout the world 
this expanded offering primarily contributed to the increase in our international sales in compared to although international sales increased in  in the fourth quarter we experienced sales declines  which we believe were the results of the strengthening of the us dollar combined with global economic weakness 
on a constant dollar basis  international sales increased in the fourth quarter of we are pleased with the growth in our international sales in and the long term opportunities we see in international markets 
however  we believe that the recent tightening of credit and deterioration of the global economic environment  in addition to the weakening of many major currencies against the us dollar  could impact our international sales growth in the near term 
gross profit gross profit decreased in the year ended january  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the decrease in net sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in the year ended january  compared to in the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is attributed to changes in product mix 
our engagement category  which typically carries a lower gross margin than our jewelry category  performed relatively better than the non engagement jewelry in the year ended january  sales of non engagement jewelry appear to have been more impacted from consumers pulling back on discretionary purchases 
additionally  costs for our jewelry products are impacted by prices for precious metals  including gold  platinum and silver  which rise and fall based upon global supply and demand dynamics 
in making retail pricing decisions  we take into account fluctuations in the pricing of precious metals  which in turn  affect the gross margin that we realize from such products 
while prices for diamonds and precious metals increased for much of  they began to decline in the latter part of as a result of lower demand caused by global economic weakness 
we anticipate that prices for diamonds and precious metals will continue to fluctuate based upon global supply and demand dynamics 
we cannot adequately predict the amount and timing of any such fluctuations 
we expect that gross profit will fluctuate in the future based on changes in product acquisition costs  product mix and pricing decisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended january  compared to million in the year ended december  due to several factors 
stock based compensation expense increased approximately million due to the number of options granted and the fair value of these stock options expensed under sfas r 
legal costs increased approximately million related to intellectual property and corporate matters 
marketing and advertising costs increased approximately million  driven by spending in online marketing vehicles  such as search  affiliate channels  online portals and other marketing initiatives to drive higher sales volumes 
depreciation expense added approximately million to expenses  primarily due to the expansion of our us fulfillment facility and the addition of our 
table of contents ireland fulfillment center in these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in payroll and related costs due primarily to lower management incentive pay in credit card processing fees decreased million due to lower sales volumes 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended january  and december   respectively 
other income  net the decrease in interest income for the year ended january  as compared with the year ended december  was due to a decrease in interest rates and lower overall cash balances  primarily due to share repurchases 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for the year ended january  was as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to lower blended tax rates 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net sales net sales increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in net sales in the year ended december  was primarily due to growth in sales volumes  nearly all due to an increase in the number of orders shipped to customers and  to a lesser extent  the average shipment value 
international sales totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of primarily due to an increase in the number of orders shipped to customers 
we believe our marketing efforts to increase brand awareness  our transition to local currency on our uk and canadian websites  and our continued efforts to expand our product selection and lower our retail prices all contributed to the increased order volumes for the year ended december  gross profit the increase in gross profit in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resulted primarily from increases in net sales volume  as discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to volume increases in the non engagement jewelry category  which typically carries a higher gross margin than the engagement category  partially offset by cost increases of metal components of our jewelry products that were not fully passed on to our customers 
the engagement category  which includes diamonds and ring settings  represented approximately of our total net sales in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to several factors 
marketing costs increased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to increased spending in online marketing vehicles  such as search  affiliate channels  online portals and other marketing initiatives to drive higher sales volumes 
payroll and related costs increased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due to additional personnel and increased compensation costs 
stock based compensation increased approximately million to million compared to the year ended december   due to the number and fair value of stock options expensed under sfas r 
credit card processing fees increased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   
table of contents due to the increase in sales volume 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses also includes costs related to the establishment of our new international facility in ireland 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  resulted primarily from our ability to leverage our fixed cost base 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income 
the increase of million in interest income in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to an increase in the average cash balance partially offset by a decrease in interest rates 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the december  effective tax rate reflects a benefit of million due to deferred tax asset adjustments 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations through cash generated by operations  the sale of equity securities  subordinated indebtedness  credit facilities and capital lease obligations 
the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash and trade accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our business model provides certain beneficial working capital characteristics 
while we collect cash from sales to customers within several business days of the related sale  we typically have extended payment terms with our suppliers 
recessionary economic cycles  investment and credit market conditions  unemployment levels and other economic factors impact consumer spending patterns 
the extensive weakening of the us and global economies that began in has had a significant impact on consumer spending  including the sale of luxury products such as jewelry 
if the current challenging general economic conditions continue  we believe our revenue  cash flow from operations and net income will be negatively impacted and may decline from historical levels 
our liquidity is primarily dependent upon our net cash from operating activities 
our net cash from operating activities is sensitive to many factors  including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures 
working capital at any specific point in time is dependent upon many variables  including our operating results  seasonality  inventory management and assortment expansion  the timing of cash receipts and payments  and vendor payment terms 
as of january   working capital totaled million  consisting of cash and cash equivalents of million  inventory of million and other current assets totaling approximately million  offset by accounts payable of million and other current liabilities totaling approximately million 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  cash and cash equivalents  inventory and accounts payable are generally higher in the fourth quarter  resulting in fluctuations in our working capital 
net cash used in operating activities was million in the year ended january  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million and million in the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended january  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the working capital dynamics of our model associated with the sales decline in the fourth quarter and the resulting slower than historical build up of accounts payable and  to a lesser extent  our decrease in net income of million 
accounts payable decreased million in the year ended january  compared to an increase of million in the year ended december  we experience greater cash flow from operations in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due to the significant increase in revenue from our 
table of contents holiday sales 
in the first quarter  we typically have a significant pay down of our accounts payable balance that was built up during the fourth quarter holiday season 
due to lower sales volumes in the year ended january   particularly in our fourth fiscal quarter  we experienced a net decrease in payables for the year ended january   compared to a net increase in payables for the year ended december  similarly  accrued liabilities decreased million compared to an increase of million in non cash benefits realized upon the exercise of stock options  which represent the tax deductions in excess of stock compensation expense recorded in the financial statements  decreased to million in the year ended january   from million in the year ended december  due to the number of options exercised and the change in the market price of our common stock 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in working capital from inventory of million for the year ended january  compared to a net decrease in working capital from inventory of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to cash generated from net income of million  non cash stock based compensation expense of million  tax benefits realized upon the exercise of stock options of million  and growth in accounts payable related to net sales growth and extended payment terms with our suppliers 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in inventory balances  the change in deferred income taxes resulting from the utilization of our tax net operating losses and  to a lesser extent  a higher accounts receivable balance due to settlement timing differences at december  compared to december  net cash of million was used in investing activities in the year ended january  for the net purchase of property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and million in the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively  primarily related to the net sales of marketable securities 
our capital needs are generally minimal and include computer hardware and software to operate our websites  capital improvements to our leased warehouse and office facilities  and furniture and equipment 
additionally  we have the ability to reduce and or delay capital investments in challenging economic conditions  without significant disruption to our business or operations 
we do not anticipate significant growth in our capital expenditures for at least the next months 
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended january  was million  primarily related to the repurchase of our common stock 
during the year ended january   we repurchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock within the month period following the approval date of such additional repurchase 
this repurchase authorization expired on july  on february   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common stock within the month period following the approval date of such additional repurchase 
as of january   approximately million remains under this repurchase authorization 
since the inception of our buyback programs in the first quarter of through january   we have repurchased million shares for a total of million 
shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions or in negotiated transactions off the market 
the timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by management based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
repurchases may also be made under a rule b plan  which would permit shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws 
we continually assess market conditions  our cash position  operating results  current forecasts and other factors when making decisions about stock repurchases 
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december  was million  related primarily to repurchases of our common stock 
in the year ended december   we purchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises partially offset the cash used to repurchase common shares 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december  was million relating primarily to the repurchases of our common stock 
in the year ended december   we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the cash used to repurchase shares was partially offset by the proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on liquidity and cash flows as of january  in thousands 
less than over contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases financing obligation purchase obligations purchase obligations includes open merchandise purchase orders at january  includes commitments for advertising and marketing services at january  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we do not carry any long or short term debt 
however  projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to many factors and to uncertainty 
we continually assess our capital structure and opportunities to obtain credit facilities  sell equity or debt securities  or undertake other transactions for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
however  there can be no assurance that additional equity  debt or other financing transactions will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements at january   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation and changing prices on our operations was not significant during the periods presented
