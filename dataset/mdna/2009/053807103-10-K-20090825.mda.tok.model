item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of avnet and the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the description of the business appearing in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other information appearing in item of this report 
the company operates on a week fiscal year 
the fiscal years ended june   june  and june  all contained weeks 
fiscal year will have weeks ending on july  there are numerous references to the impact of foreign currency translation in the discussion of the company s results of operations 
over the past several years  the exchange rates between the us dollar and many foreign currencies  especially the euro  have fluctuated significantly 
for example  the us dollar has strengthened against the euro by approximately when comparing fiscal with fiscal and the dollar weakened against the euro by approximately when comparing fiscal with fiscal when the stronger us dollar exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of avnet s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies  the resulting impact is a decrease in us dollars of reported results as compared with the prior period 
when the us dollar weakens  the resulting impact is an increase in us dollars of reported results as compared with the prior period 
in the discussion that follows  this is referred to as the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company also discloses certain non gaap financial information  such as income or expense items as adjusted for the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as discussed above 
sales adjusted for the impact of acquisitions by adjusting avnet s prior periods to include the sales of businesses acquired as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the period presented and  in the discussion that follows  this adjustment for acquisitions is referred to as pro forma sales or organic sales 
operating income excluding the non cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recognized during fiscal  the impact of which is presented in the following table operating income pre tax income net income fiscal loss loss loss eps in thousands  except per share data gaap results impairment charges adjusted results management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods  primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these items 
management also uses these non gaap measures to establish operational goals and  in some cases  for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results and outlook on a non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  data presented in accordance with gaap 

table of contents results of operations executive summary during fiscal year  the company s financial results were adversely impacted by the global economic slowdown as year over year sales declined by just over and organic sales declined by over 
however  there are indications that the current economic environment may be stabilizing as sequential sales in the june quarter were essentially flat  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
gross profit margins declined basis points year over year primarily due to business mix changes in em and market conditions 
as a result of the write down of goodwill and intangible assets  the company incurred an operating loss of just over billion compared to operating income of million in fiscal excluding impairment charges  operating income margins declined basis points 
as the challenging economic environment accelerated during the fiscal year  demand continued to weaken in both operating groups and  in response  the company took actions to continue to reduce costs over the course of the fiscal year to better align its cost structure with the market conditions 
approximately of the total of million in annualized cost savings had been achieved through the end of the fiscal  with the remaining actions expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal in addition  the company expects to achieve cost synergies of approximately million as a result of acquisition integration activities most of which were completed by the end of fiscal with the remaining expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal the company continued to focus on managing working capital  defined as receivables plus inventory less accounts payable  which declined year over year and contributed to the generation of over billion in cash from operating activities as compared with million in fiscal however  as revenues seem to be stabilizing and working capital velocity are at appropriate levels for the operating groups  management does not expect to continue to generate the same levels of cash from operating activities as were generated in fiscal during fiscal  the company invested in five acquisitions see table in the sales section and expects to continue to make strategic investments through acquisition activity to the extent the investments strengthen avnet s competitive position and meet management s return on capital requirements

table of contents items impacting year over year sales comparisons during the past three fiscal years  the company acquired fourteen businesses impacting both operating groups  as presented in the following table 
as the acquisitions impact the comparison of fiscal year sales performance over prior years  the discussions that follow include sales on a pro forma basis as well as on a reported basis

em emea fiscal azure technologies ts asia pac access distribution ts americas  emea in addition  a change to net revenue reporting impacted the comparative financial results for avnet when comparing fiscal results to fiscal in conjunction with the acquisition of access distribution  the company reviewed its method of recording revenue related to the sales of supplier service contracts and determined that such sales were to be classified on a net revenue basis rather than on a gross basis effective with the third quarter of fiscal referred to as the change to net revenue reporting in this md a 
although this change reduced sales and cost of sales and positively impacted gross and operating profit margins for the technology solutions operating group and on a consolidated basis  it had no impact on operating income  net income  cash flow or the balance sheet 
as the change to net revenue reported impacts the sales performance comparisons  the discussions that follow include sales adjusted for this impact 
fiscal comparison to fiscal the table below provides the comparison of reported fiscal and sales for the company and its operating groups to pro forma or organic sales which consist of reported sales adjusted for acquisitions that closed

excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sales declined year over year 
both operating groups experienced double digit organic contraction in sales as consolidated pro forma sales were down year over year 
however  on a sequential quarterly basis  fourth quarter consolidated sales grew and were essentially flat on a pro forma basis 
in response to the year over year organic sales contraction in both operating groups  management took actions during fiscal to reduce costs 
see discussion under selling  general and administrative expenses later in this md a 
em sales of billion declined over the prior year sales of billion and declined excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the decline in revenue was most significant in the americas and the emea regions as the global economic slowdown negatively impacted the broad industrial markets in these regions 
year over year sales were down  and in the americas  emea and asia  respectively 
the decline in emea sales was compounded by the negative impact of the us dollar strengthening against the euro during fiscal as the emea region s year over year sales declined excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and on a pro forma basis 
year over year organic sales in the americas and asia declined and  respectively  however  asia sales grew sequentially in the fourth quarter of fiscal ts sales of billion in fiscal were down year over year and down excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
organic sales declined year over year 
year over year sales in the americas and emea were down and  respectively 
asia sales were up year over year and up on a sequential quarterly basis  due in part to the recent organic investments in china and the acquisition in india 
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  emea year over year revenue was up but organic sales were down year over year 
fiscal comparison to fiscal the following table provides a comparison of reported sales for fiscal and fiscal to pro forma sales which are adjusted for i acquisitions completed in fiscal and as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year and ii the change to net revenue reporting as if the change had occurred at the 
table of contents beginning of fiscal the pro forma sales information allows readers to better assess and understand the company s revenue performance on a more comparable basis

on a pro forma basis  consolidated sales and sales for em and ts were roughly higher year over year 
em generated fiscal sales of billion  representing a increase over fiscal sales 
excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  em fiscal sales increased over the prior year 
on a pro forma basis  em sales increased over fiscal em americas year over year sales growth was while the emea region sales were up year over year and down excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales growth in asia was year over year and on a pro forma basis 
the asia region continued to experience the highest growth rate among the three regions 
ts reported sales of billion for fiscal  up billion  or  compared with fiscal sales of billion 
excluding the positive translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  ts sales were up year over year 
on a pro forma basis  ts sales grew over prior year 
at a regional level  sales in the americas region were up year over year on a reported basis and up on a pro forma basis as growth in storage and networking offset declines in proprietary servers 
in emea  sales were up on a reported basis and up on a pro forma basis 
in asia  sales growth was year over year on a reported basis benefited by acquisitions 
on a pro forma basis  asia grew over prior year  impacted by relatively weak microprocessor and memory product sales in the last quarter of fiscal gross profit and gross profit margins consolidated gross profit for fiscal was billion  down million  or  over the prior year primarily due to the decline in revenue 
gross profit margin of declined basis points over prior year 
for em  gross profit margin was down basis points year over year as it was negatively impacted by the combination of a regional mix shift to asia  which represented of em sales as compared with in the prior year  and lower margins in the americas region 
ts gross profit margin was up basis points year over year as the emea region s improvement was mostly offset by declines in the americas and asia regions 
consolidated gross profit was billion in fiscal  a million increase  or  as compared with fiscal this increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and the year over year weakening of the us dollar against the euro 
consolidated gross profit margin of in fiscal decreased basis points from the prior year due primarily to slightly lower margins at ts and the mix of business between em and ts described below 
the em asia business continued to grow faster than the americas or emea regions  and although the em asia business has relatively lower gross profit margin than the other regions  em s gross profit margin increased basis points over prior year 
ts gross profit margins declined basis points year over year 
in addition  as a result of the acquisitions in fiscal  ts sales grew to of the consolidated sales as compared with of the consolidated sales in fiscal because the ts business typically yields lower gross margins relative to the em business  the larger representation by ts in the consolidated sales also has a negative impact on the 
table of contents consolidated gross profit margin 
notwithstanding the lower gross profit margins  the ts business contributed to the company s performance goals through the combination of its operating profit margin and asset velocity which is typically higher than asset velocity at em 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses were billion in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  over the prior year 
management estimates that this cost reduction was net of approximately million in additional sg a expenses associated with companies acquired in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in sg a expenses of million due to the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
metrics that management monitors with respect to its operating expenses are sg a expenses as a percentage of sales and as a percentage of gross profit 
in fiscal  sg a expenses were of sales and of gross profit as compared with and  respectively  in fiscal due to the decline in sales and gross profit margin  the company initiated significant cost reduction actions over the past four quarters in order to realign its expense structure with market conditions  however  the precipitous decline in revenue has more than offset the beneficial impact of the cost reduction actions undertaken to date see restructuring  integration and other charges for a discussion of charges associated with the actions undertaken 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company began to experience demand weakness and organic sales growth at both em and ts continued to slow through the first quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  the company experienced continued sales deceleration in both operating groups  particularly in november in the asia region and in december in the americas region 
during the third quarter of fiscal  end demand in the em business deteriorated even further  in particular in em americas and em emea which have been the company s most profitable regions 
as a result of the poor market conditions through mid march  the company took actions to reduce costs by approximately million on an annualized basis and expected such actions to be completed by the end of the june quarter 
however  based upon third quarter results  the company announced further actions to reduce annualized costs by an additional million  bringing the aggregate annual cost reductions announced to approximately million since march as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  management estimates that approximately million in annualized cost savings have been achieved 
the remaining cost reduction actions are anticipated to be complete by the end of september with the full benefit of the cost savings expected to be reflected in the december quarter of fiscal in addition  the company expects to achieve cost synergies of approximately million as a result of acquisition integration activities most of which were completed by the end of fiscal with the remaining expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal sg a expenses in fiscal were billion  a million increase  or  as compared with fiscal the year over year increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to acquisitions and the weakening of the us dollar versus the euro 
management estimates that approximately million of the sg a expense increase was attributable to the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sg a expenses were also impacted by the overall volume increase due to acquisitions 
furthermore  management believed that during second half of fiscal  sg a expenses were higher than necessary to support the level of business in certain business segments due to revenue weakness in those segments 
as a result  during the second half of fiscal  management took actions  as described in restructuring  integration and other charges  to adjust the company s cost structure 
in fiscal  sg a expenses were of sales and of gross profit as compared with and  respectively  in fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal were flat as compared with fiscal  however  sg a expenses as a percentage of gross profits were up basis points 
impairment charges during fiscal  the company recognized non cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling billion pre tax  billion after tax and per share 
the company performs its annual goodwill impairment test on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter 
in addition  if and when events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its reporting units below its carrying value  an interim test would be performed 
since the end of september  
table of contents the company s market capitalization declined steadily  which was relatively in line with the decline in the overall market  and was significantly below book value during the second quarter of fiscal due primarily to the global economic downturn s impact on the company s performance and the turmoil in the equity markets 
as a result of these events  the company determined an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary and performed the interim test on all six of its reporting units as of december  based on the test results  the company determined that goodwill at four of its reporting units was impaired 
accordingly  during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of billion pre tax  billion after tax and per share to write off all goodwill related to its em americas  em asia  ts emea and ts asia reporting units 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test which indicated that three of its six reporting units  including em asia and ts emea  continued to have fair values below their carrying values 
as a result  the company was required to recognize the impairment of additional goodwill which arose subsequent to the second quarter of fiscal in the em asia and ts emea reporting units 
of the non cash goodwill impairment charges of million pre and after tax and per share recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal  million related to the recently acquired business in japan  which was assigned to the em asia reporting unit 
accounting standards require goodwill from an acquisition to be assigned to a reporting unit and also requires goodwill to be tested on a reporting unit level  not by individual acquisition 
as noted above  the annual impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of the em asia reporting unit continued to be below its carrying value 
as a result  the goodwill from the recent acquisition was required to be impaired 
the remaining million of the impairment charges related to additional goodwill in the ts emea reporting unit primarily as a result of final acquisition adjustments during the purchase price allocation period related to an acquisition for which the goodwill had been fully impaired in the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company also evaluated the recoverability of its long lived assets at each of the reporting units where goodwill was deemed to be impaired 
based upon this evaluation  the company determined that certain of its amortizable intangible assets were impaired 
as a result  the company recognized a non cash intangible asset impairment charge of million pre and after tax and per share during the second quarter of fiscal in conjunction with the annual goodwill impairment test  the company again evaluated the recoverability of its long lived assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that no impairment had occurred 
the non cash impairment charges had no impact on the company s compliance with debt covenants  its cash flows or available liquidity  but did have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

ts operating income of million was down year over year and operating income margin of was down basis points year over year 
similar to em  the decline in ts operating margin was due to lower sales and gross profit margins  in particular in the americas region  and the benefits from the cost reduction actions only partially offset the decline 
corporate operating expenses were million  a decrease of million as compared with million in fiscal operating income for fiscal was million  or of consolidated sales  as compared with operating income of million  or of consolidated sales  in fiscal operating income margin declined basis points over the prior year primarily due to the results at ts and the mix of business between em and ts

income tax provision avnet s effective tax rate on its income loss before income taxes was in fiscal as compared with in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was negatively impacted by the non deductibility of substantially all of the impairment charges and changes to existing tax positions

avnet s effective tax rate on its income before income taxes was in fiscal as compared with in fiscal the year over year decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to the combination of certain 
table of contents statutory tax rate reductions and a favorable audit settlement  offset by the recognition of transfer pricing exposures and a change to estimates on existing tax positions 
in addition  there was a negative impact on the tax rate in the prior year due to an additional tax provision for transfer pricing exposures in europe  which effectively increased the prior year s tax rate

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the company s continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that 
table of contents require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to valuation of receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customer defaults 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as the company s regular assessment of the financial condition of its customers 
therefore  if collection experience or the financial condition of specific customers were to deteriorate  management would evaluate whether additional allowances and corresponding charges to the consolidated statement of operations are required 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets wherein such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company regularly evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories less marketable 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers  which may provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of rights of return and price protection 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  management would evaluate whether additional write downs of inventories are required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
the company establishes reserves for potentially unfavorable outcomes of positions taken on certain tax matters 
these reserves are based on management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
there may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in reversals of reserves or additional tax liabilities in excess of the reserved amounts 
to the extent such adjustments are warranted  the company s effective tax rate may potentially fluctuate as a result 
in determining the company s effective tax rate  management considers current tax regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which it operates  and requires management s judgment for interpretation and application 
changes to such tax regulations or disagreements with the company s interpretation or application by tax authorities in any of the company s major jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the company s provision for income taxes 

table of contents restructuring  integration and impairment charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
additionally  in assessing the company s goodwill for impairment the company is required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows and overall performance of its reporting units 
the company is also required to make judgments regarding the evaluation of changes in events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its reporting units below its carrying value  the results of which would determine whether an interim test must be performed 
should these assumptions or judgments change in the future based upon market conditions or should the structure of the company s reporting units change based upon changes in business strategy  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges to its remaining goodwill 
see impairment charges in this md a for further discussion of the company s evaluation of goodwill impairment in fiscal contingencies and litigation from time to time  the company may become liable with respect to pending and threatened litigation  tax  environmental and other matters 
management does not anticipate that any contingent matters will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
revenue recognition the company does not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of its business in which revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met upon the actual shipment of product to the customer 
accordingly  other than for estimates related to possible returns of products from customers  discounts or rebates  the recording of revenue does not require significant judgments or estimates 
provisions for returns are estimated based on historical sales returns  credit memo analysis and other known factors 
provisions are made for discounts and rebates  which are primarily volume based  and are generally based on historical trends and anticipated customer buying patterns 
finally  revenues from maintenance contracts  which are deferred and recognized in income over the life of the agreement  are not material to the consolidated results of operations of the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements  from time to time  which are intended to provide a hedge against all or a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
the company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 

table of contents the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of the company s debt outstanding at june  dollars in millions fiscal year thereafter total liabilities fixed rate debt floating rate debt excludes discounts on long term notes 
the following table sets forth the carrying value and fair value of the company s debt at june  dollars in millions carrying value at fair value at carrying value at fair value at june  june  june  june  liabilities fixed rate debt average interest rate floating rate debt average interest rate excludes discounts and premiums on long term notes 
many of the company s subsidiaries  on occasion  purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the company adjusts all foreign denominated balances and any outstanding foreign exchange contracts to fair market value through the consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the market risk related to foreign exchange contracts is offset by changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the asset or liability representing the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is classified in the captions other current assets or accrued expenses and other  as applicable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates under the contracts outstanding at june  would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts  which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged positions
