results of operations economic outlook the current economic environment has made consumers more cautious 
this could lead to reduced consumer spending  to consumers trading down to a less expensive mix of products or to consumers trading down to discounters for grocery items  all of which could affect safeway s sales growth 
additionally  in this uncertain economy  it is difficult to forecast whether we are entering a period of inflation or deflation 
in  safeway experienced overall inflation  while early indications suggest that there may be deflation in certain product categories in food deflation could reduce sales growth  while food inflation  combined with reduced consumer spending  could reduce gross profit margins 
however  in a slowing economy  some customers may trade down from dining out in restaurants to shopping more at grocery stores such as safeway and from purchasing national brand products to purchasing less expensive safeway private label brands 
additionally  when fuel prices are high  consumers may switch from shopping at more remote club and discount stores to safeway s more convenient neighborhood locations

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of safeway s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents safeway inc 
and subsidiaries workers compensation the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liability as determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
self insurance reserves are actuarially determined primarily by applying historical paid loss and incurred loss development trends to current cash and incurred expected losses in order to estimate total losses 
we then discount total expected losses to their present value using a risk free rate of return 
any actuarial projection of self insured losses is subject to a high degree of variability 
for example  self insurance expense increased to million in fiscal from million in and million in litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes  claim settlement patterns and similar factors influenced historical development trends that were used to determine the current year expense and therefore contributed to the variability in annual expense 
however  these factors are not direct inputs into the actuarial projection  and thus their individual impact cannot be quantified 
we believe that the discount rate is a significant factor that has led to variability in self insured expenses 
since the discount rate is a direct input into the estimation process  we are able to quantify its impact 
the discount rate  which is based on the united states treasury note rates for the estimated average claim life of five years  was in  in and in a basis point change in the discount rate affects the self insured liability by approximately million 
the majority of the company s workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in california 
california workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the state s politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business 
some of the many sources of uncertainty in the company s reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels  medical fee schedules  medical utilization guidelines  vocation rehabilitation and apportionment 
store closures safeway s policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values 
when stores that are under long term leases close  safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  net of estimated cost recoveries 
in both cases  fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest 
the company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and  when necessary  uses real estate brokers 
however  these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation  real estate markets and economic conditions 
at any one time  safeway has a portfolio of closed stores which is widely dispersed over several markets 
while individual closed store reserves are likely to be adjusted up or down in the future to reflect changes in assumptions  the change to the total closed store reserve has not been nor is expected to be material

additional disclosures are also required 
safeway adopted sfas no 
as of december   as required 
the determination of safeway s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent  in part  on the company s selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions are disclosed in note i to the consolidated financial statements and include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
actual results in any given year will often 
table of contents safeway inc 
and subsidiaries differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while safeway believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect safeway s pension and other postretirement obligations and its future expense 
safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments 
the discount rate assumption used to determine the year end projected benefit obligation is increased or decreased to be consistent with the change in yield rates for high quality fixed income investments for the expected period to maturity of the pension benefits 
the discount rate used to determine pension expense was 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the company s portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices  as well as target asset allocation 
safeway s target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the company s long term pension requirements 
for the company s assumed rate of return was on us pension assets and on canadian pension assets 
over the year period ended january   the average rate of return was approximately for us and for canadian pension assets 
at december   the year average rate of return was approximately for us and for canadian pension assets 
the deteriorating conditions in the global financial markets during led to a substantial reduction in the year average rate of return on pension assets 
we expect that the markets will eventually recover to our assumed long term rate of return 
the following table summarizes actual allocations for safeway s plans at year end and year end plan assets asset category target equity fixed income cash and other total the investment policy also emphasizes the following key objectives maintain a diversified portfolio among asset classes and investment styles  maintain an acceptable level of risk in pursuit of long term economic benefit  maximize the opportunity for value added returns from active investment management while establishing investment guidelines and monitoring procedures for each investment manager to ensure the characteristics of the portfolio are consistent with the original investment mandate  and maintain adequate controls over administrative costs

r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on the fair value on the date of grant 
the company determines fair value of such awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions  such as a risk free interest rate  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and expected life of options  in order to arrive at a fair value estimate 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be evaluated for impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter  or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  by initially comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to their related carrying values 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we perform an additional step to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with that reporting unit 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  such excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
our goodwill impairment analysis also includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of all reporting units to our total market capitalization 
therefore  a significant and sustained decline in our stock price could result in goodwill impairment charges 
during times of financial market volatility  significant judgment is given to determine the underlying cause of the decline and whether stock price declines are short term in nature or indicative of an event or change in circumstances 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the estimate of fair value of each of our reporting units is based on our projection of sales  gross profit  operating profit and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time  but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the valuations employ present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
based upon the results of our september  analysis  no impairment of goodwill was indicated 
as of september   if forecasted cash flows had been lower than estimated or if the discount rate applied in our analysis had been higher than estimated  no goodwill impairment would have been indicated 
however  changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment  including expected future cash flows and discount rate  could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units in the future 
income tax contingencies the company is subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and other foreign  state and local taxing authorities
