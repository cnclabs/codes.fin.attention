item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on price increases for polyurethane foam 
as of october   we had unshipped orders of approximately  which represents a decrease compared to our backlog of million at fiscal year end we believe the decline in our fiscal year end level of unshipped orders from to was an aberration caused by an unusual fluctuation in the timing of orders received 
we do not believe that the decline in unshipped orders is indicative of expected sales trends in fiscal it is common for our level of unshipped orders to fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
order volumes and shipments after october  have been similar to historical levels and have generally met our expectations 
we expect to fill all orders in the current backlog in the fiscal year 
employees we had full time employees as of october  of these employees  eight were officers  were management personnel  were administrative and clerical personnel  were sales personnel  and were manufacturing employees 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and have never experienced an interruption or curtailment of operations due to labor controversy 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
supervision and regulation the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and regulations issued or proposed thereunder  provide for regulation by the fda of the marketing  manufacture  labeling  packaging and distribution of medical devices  including our products 
these regulations require  among other things  that medical device manufacturers register with the fda  list devices manufactured by them  and file various reports 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with good manufacturing practices as required by the fda and state regulatory authorities 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations and do not anticipate having to make any material expenditures as a result of fda or other regulatory requirements 
we are certified as an iso and iso supplier for our pressureguard mattress products from our greenville  south carolina plant 
these standards are prepared by the american society for quality control standards committee to correspond to the international standard iso iso the international organization for standardization is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies dealing with quality system requirements that can be used by a supplier to demonstrate its capability and for the assessment of the capability of a supplier by external parties 
compliance with iso standard is required by health canada for all class ii medical devices sold there 
all of our powered therapeutic support surfaces for the health care market are considered class ii medical devices 
the certification is subject to reassessment at six month intervals 
we have maintained our certification based on the results of iso audits conducted during fiscal year environmental matters our manufacturing operations are subject to various government regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations 
we do not anticipate that continued compliance will have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
item a 
risk factors the loss of a key distributor or customer in the company s medical or custom products segments could cause a rapid and significant sales decline  which would likely result in a decline in earnings 
many of our medical products are sold through large national distributors in the united states and canada 
we do not maintain long term distribution agreements with most of these distributors 
instead  we supply them based on purchase orders that are issued by the customers on a daily or weekly basis 
these supplier customer relationships can generally be ended by either party with minimal notice 
consequently  if a large customer or distributor decided to discontinue purchasing our products  our sales and earnings could quickly decline 
our largest customer in the medical segment is mckesson medical surgical which accounted for of sales in the medical segment in fiscal in addition  all of our consumer foam products are sold through our exclusive distributor  louisville bedding company  under a marketing and distribution agreement that expires in december the agreement automatically renews for successive three year terms unless either party provides notice of its intent not to renew at least days prior to the expiration date

the current weakness in the us economy and associated problems in the credit markets could cause our sales to decline  which in turn could have a negative effect on our earnings 
our fastest growing products during the last five years have been our lines of therapeutic support surfaces  which consist of our pressureguard and geo mattress products as well as our private label support surfaces 
sales of these support surfaces represented of our total net sales in fiscal these products are generally considered by us and our customers to be capital purchase items instead of consumable supplies 
we believe that purchases of these capital goods are more easily postponed during business downturns than purchases of consumables 
consequently  sales of our support surfaces are likely to be more sensitive to general economic weakness than other medical product lines in our business 
also  tight conditions in credit markets could make it more difficult for our customers to obtain financing for capital expenditures  which could slow sales particularly within our support surface product lines 
therapeutic support surface sales decreased during fiscal compared with fiscal sales of our therapeutic support surfaces may continue to decline if the economy remains weak 
in addition  our industrial products are sold primarily to the water sports  automotive and packaging industries  as well as various other manufacturers 
our industrial business has historically been more affected by general economic trends than other span america product lines 
therefore an economic downturn is likely to have a greater effect on sales of industrial products than on other product lines in our business 
industrial sales decreased during fiscal compared with fiscal sales of industrial products could continue to decline if the economy remains weak 
since many of our operating costs are fixed within a reasonable range of sales and production activity  sales declines could result in proportionally greater declines in earnings performance 
we would attempt to reduce expenses in response to lower sales levels  but we cannot give assurance that we would be able to fully offset the effect of a rapid decline in sales volume 
our medical business could lose sales volume or could have a lower sales growth rate as a result of government reimbursement changes in the medical market 
a number of our medical products are eligible for reimbursement by medicare 
we receive no direct reimbursements from medicare  but our customers often submit reimbursement requests to medicare 
for example  we sell therapeutic support surfaces to home health care dealers who in turn rent these products to patients 
medicare reimburses the dealers for some or all of the patient s rental cost 
if medicare reimbursement rates are reduced  the demand for our medical products that are covered by medicare could also be reduced  depending on the size of the rate reduction 
our earnings could be negatively affected by raw material cost increases that we are unable to recover through sales price increases 
the cost of polyurethane foam represented approximately of our total cost of goods sold in fiscal an increase in foam raw material costs that we are not able to pass through to our customers by increasing prices could have a significant negative effect on our profitability 
besides polyurethane foam  our other major raw material categories include mattress covers made of various water proof fabrics  vinyl bags  vinyl air cylinders  electronic components for mattresses and corrugated boxes 
raw materials are our single largest cost category  representing approximately of our total cost of goods sold in fiscal cost increases in these raw materials could have a significant adverse effect on earnings if we are unable to recover the higher costs through sales price increases or operating expense reductions 
our sales volume could decline as a result of competition from low cost foreign imports 
during the last two years  we have experienced increased competition in our medical and custom products segments from low cost foreign imports 
in the medical segment  the number of low cost  imported mattress products has increased in the last two years  but it has not yet had a significant impact on our medical business 
we believe that we have potentially greater exposure to low cost imports in our consumer bedding product lines because those products have more commodity like characteristics than our medical products 
also  our customers  which are generally national retailers  are more likely to change suppliers to buy lower cost products 
therefore  we could lose significant sales volume in our consumer bedding business and smaller parts of our medical sales volume if we are unable to compete effectively with low cost imports 
certain of our medical products are classified as medical devices and are regulated by the fda 
these regulations require  among other things  that medical device manufacturers register with the fda  list devices manufactured by them  and file various reports 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with good manufacturing practices as required by the fda and state regulatory authorities 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations  the existence of the regulations creates the risk of a product recall and related expenses as well as the risk of additional expenses required to meet the regulatory requirements 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties we own our principal office and manufacturing facility  which is located in greenville  south carolina 
this facility contains approximately  square feet used by the medical and custom products segments and is located on a acre site 
we believe that our current manufacturing and storage space is adequate to support our operations during the next several years  depending on sales growth rates 
we also lease  square feet of warehouse space in salt lake city  utah for use as a distribution center for our medical products 
we lease this facility on a month by month basis at a rate of  per month 
we consider the south carolina and utah facilities to be suitable and adequate for their intended purposes 
item legal proceedings from time to time we are a party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
we believe that as a result of legal defenses and insurance arrangements with parties believed to be financially capable  there are no proceedings threatened or pending against us that  if determined adversely  would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

these return ratios are calculated using net income as shown above  which includes losses from discontinued operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview span america s operations are divided into two primary business units or segments medical and custom products 
our revenues  profits and cash flows are derived from the development  manufacture and sale of products for these two market segments 
in the medical segment  we manufacture and market a comprehensive selection of pressure management products  including geo matt  pressureguard  geo mattress  span aids and isch dish products 
we license and market  but do not manufacture  selan skin care products 
in the custom products segment  we manufacture consumer mattress pads and pillows for the retail bedding market and various engineered foam products for the industrial market 
our consumer mattress pads and pillows are marketed by our exclusive distributor  louisville bedding company 
we sell the industrial product line directly to our customers instead of using distributors 
prior to fiscal year  we had a third business unit engaged in the development  manufacture and sale of safety catheters 
we decided to exit the safety catheter business in october revenues and expenses related to the safety catheter business in fiscal years and are shown in our financial statements as a discontinued operation 
results of operations for fiscal year were restated to show the safety catheter segment as a discontinued operation 
results of operations fiscal vs 
summary total sales in fiscal declined to million compared with million in fiscal because of lower sales volume in our medical segment  which was partially offset by increases in sales volume in our custom products segment 
medical sales were down to million due mainly to a decline in sales of private label therapeutic support surfaces 
custom products sales for fiscal increased to million due to higher sales of consumer bedding products compared with fiscal year income from continuing operations declined in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  because of lower sales levels 
net income  which includes results from the discontinued safety catheter segment  also fell in fiscal to million  or per diluted share 
sales total sales in our core medical business declined to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the decline in medical sales was primarily related to the expiration of a private label supply contract with hill rom that accounted for million in fiscal sales compared with million in fiscal sales 
consequently  sales of therapeutic support surfaces  including private label products  declined by to million during fiscal compared with million in fiscal therapeutic support surfaces  or mattresses  are our largest medical product line  making up of our medical segment sales in fiscal and in fiscal we sell these specialty mattresses to hospitals  long term care facilities and home care dealers throughout the united states and canada 
sales of therapeutic support surfaces have declined compared to previous fiscal years due primarily to the expiration of the private label contract mentioned above and secondarily due to reduced capital spending by many of our customers 
excluding sales to hill rom in both years  sales of therapeutic support surfaces would have declined by in fiscal compared with fiscal sales of the new risk manager bedside safety mat  introduced at the beginning of our second fiscal quarter in  were  in fiscal sales of our span aids patient positioners and mattress overlays both increased by during fiscal compared with fiscal selan skin care sales fell  and sales of seating products increased during fiscal the growth in sales of positioners  overlays and seating products in fiscal was mainly due to sales price increases during the year 
medical sales accounted for of total net sales in fiscal year compared with in fiscal we expect medical sales for to be higher than those of our custom products segment consists of consumer bedding products and specialty foam products for the industrial market 
sales in the custom products segment increased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the primary reason for the increase occurred in the consumer part of the custom products segment  where sales increased to million compared with million in fiscal this increase was caused by higher volumes of consumer mattress overlays sold to existing customers and the addition of several new customers during the year 
all of our consumer products are sold through our marketing and distribution partner  louisville bedding company 
early in  span america was selected as one of three companies to supply consumer mattress pads to sam s club 
we began shipping the new products in april  and our sales to sam s club in fiscal were million 
we learned in august that sam s club had selected an offshore company as its sole supplier of mattress pads and that span america would not be a continuing supplier to sam s club 
our ongoing business with wal mart is unaffected by the sam s club decision 
we plan to sell the remaining sam s club related inventory  and we do not expect significant future write offs or charges related to the loss of the sam s club business 
we expect consumer sales in fiscal to be lower than they were in fiscal primarily because of the loss of the sam s club business described above 
in the other part of the custom products segment  industrial sales decreased in fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal this portion of our business has been more impacted by the weak economy as our largest customers serve the water sports  automotive and packaging markets that have been adversely affected by the recession 
we believe that industrial sales in fiscal will be higher than those of fiscal because we expect increased demand in our key industrial markets as the u 
s 
economy improves 
there can be no assurance  however  that economic conditions will improve or that industrial sales will increase 
gross profit our gross profit decreased by during fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal gross margin increased to for fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit was caused mostly by lower sales volume in the medical segment 
the increase in gross margin was the result of lower raw material costs during fiscal and the ongoing implementation of lean manufacturing techniques during the year 
as a result of the lean manufacturing initiatives  we have improved our overall manufacturing efficiency  and specifically we have reduced scrap rates  improved product yields and reduced labor costs 
we expect our gross profit in fiscal to be higher than in  but we believe our gross margin will be slightly lower than because of anticipated increases in raw material costs 
our gross profit and margin performance will depend heavily on sales volume  product mix and raw material costs 
selling  research development and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses increased  or  to million and of net sales in fiscal compared with of net sales in fiscal the increase occurred in the medical segment and was primarily the result of higher incentive compensation  which was partially offset by declines in evaluation samples expense and shipping costs 
we believe that total selling and marketing expenses for fiscal will increase over levels 
total research and development expenses increased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal almost all of our research and development expenses are incurred in the medical segment and are related to the development of new products  new features of existing products and design improvements 
the increase in expense during fiscal was caused by a greater number of new product development projects and higher incentive compensation for r d employees 
r d expenses will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year  depending on the nature of the development projects being pursued 
we expect total r d expenses in fiscal to be similar to those of fiscal general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the expense increase during fiscal was caused by higher incentive compensation expense and an increase in depreciation expenses associated with our new enterprise resource planning system 
these expense increases were partially offset by decreases in property and casualty insurance and bad debt expenses 
incentive compensation is determined by comparing actual operating earnings to planned operating earnings for the current fiscal year 
incentive compensation expense increased in because we exceeded our operating earnings goal by a wider margin in than in we expect administrative expenses for fiscal to be slightly lower than they were in fiscal operating income in the medical segment  operating income for fiscal declined by to million compared with million in fiscal the decrease was caused by lower medical sales volume and higher r d expenses compared with last fiscal year 
operating income in the custom products segment increased to million in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the increase in profitability of the custom products segment was caused by higher sales volume in our consumer product lines  improved manufacturing efficiencies as discussed above and lower raw material costs 
the profit improvement for our consumer product lines was partially offset by a profit decline in our industrial product lines caused by a sharp decrease in industrial sales volume 
operating income for the total company declined in fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal as discussed above  the decline in medical operating income  caused by lower medical sales volume  was greater than the improvement in operating income for the custom products segment 
non operating income investment and other income declined by to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the decline was caused by lower interest rates on overnight investments in fiscal compared with we expect investment income for fiscal to be higher than for fiscal interest expense interest expense in fiscal decreased to  compared with  in fiscal the decrease was caused by a lower average balance of long term debt in fiscal compared with as we paid off the remaining balance of  on our revolving note in the first quarter of fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion about our revolving credit facility 
net income and dividends net income  which includes results from the discontinued safety catheter segment  decreased in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the decrease in net income was primarily the result of lower medical sales volume 
during fiscal  we paid dividends of  or of net income for the year 
this amount consisted of four quarterly dividends of per share 
during fiscal  we paid dividends of  or of net income for the year 
this amount consisted of two quarterly dividends of per share and two quarterly dividends of per share 
results of operations fiscal vs 
summary total sales in fiscal declined to million compared with million in fiscal because of lower sales volume in both our medical and custom products segments 
medical sales were down to million due mainly to a decline in sales of private label therapeutic support surfaces 
custom products sales for fiscal decreased to million due to lower sales of consumer bedding products compared with fiscal year income from continuing operations declined in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  because of lower sales levels  higher raw material costs in the medical segment  a slight increase in selling expenses and a decline in non operating income 
net income  which includes results from the discontinued safety catheter segment  was up in fiscal to million  or per diluted share 
the increase in fiscal net income was caused by our exit from the safety catheter segment in early fiscal and the resulting decrease in losses from the discontinued operation 
sales total sales in our core medical business declined to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the decline in medical sales was caused mostly by lower volume of private label therapeutic support surfaces manufactured for hill rom 
sales to hill rom declined by million in fiscal sales of therapeutic support surfaces  including private label and branded products  declined by during fiscal therapeutic support surfaces  or mattresses  are our largest medical product line  making up of our medical segment sales in both fiscal and fiscal excluding sales to hill rom  sales of our therapeutic support surfaces were up in fiscal  reflecting solid growth in our branded mattress products 
growth leaders among our branded support surfaces included the pressureguard apm alternating pressure mattress and the geo mattress line of all foam support surfaces 
we had mixed results in sales of our other medical product lines during fiscal sales of our span aids patient positioners declined by due mostly to lower export business 
sales of mattress overlays increased  selan skin care sales rose and sales of seating products declined during fiscal medical sales accounted for of total net sales in fiscal year compared with in fiscal our custom products segment consists of consumer bedding products and specialty foam products for the industrial market 
sales in the custom products segment declined during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the entire decline occurred in the consumer part of the custom products segment  where sales were down to million compared with million in fiscal the consumer sales decrease was caused mostly by the loss of one customer due to bankruptcy and loss of another due to an acquisition by a competitor 
this lost business was partially offset by an increase in sales of consumer mattress overlays and pillows to wal mart  our largest customer in the custom products segment 
in the other part of the custom products segment  industrial sales increased in fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal the growth in industrial sales came from a combination of new and existing customers primarily in the automotive and water sports markets 
gross profit our gross profit decreased by during fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal gross margin declined slightly to for fiscal from in fiscal the decreases in gross profit and gross margin were caused by lower sales volume in the medical and custom products segments and higher raw material costs in the medical segment 
the increase in medical material cost was affected by higher foam costs and an increase in warranty expense related to performance problems with two electronic components within our therapeutic support surface product lines 
the problems were resolved in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note in the notes to financial statements for more information on warranty expense 
we implemented several lean manufacturing techniques during fiscal  which improved our labor usage and efficiency  particularly in the custom products segment 
as a result  our number of employees declined and labor costs declined both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the decline in labor costs partially offset higher raw material costs during the year 
manufacturing overhead expenses remained level in fiscal years and selling  research development and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses increased to million and of net sales in fiscal compared with million and of net sales in fiscal the increase occurred in the medical segment and was mostly in the categories of sales commissions  evaluation samples and shipping costs 
those expenses increased even though sales declined because we replaced most of our lost private label sales  which have no commission and shipping costs  with branded product sales  which carry standard commission and shipping costs 
total research and development expenses declined to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the decline was caused by the completion of product development projects in fiscal that were ongoing in fiscal and by lower incentive compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the expense increase was caused mainly by a decline in the cash value of corporate owned life insurance 
a decrease in the cash value of life insurance is shown as an administrative expense  while an increase is shown as a reduction in administrative expenses 
please see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below and notes and in the notes to financial statements for additional information on the cash value of life insurance 
the increase in administrative expenses also reflected higher costs for property and casualty insurance 
these expense increases were mostly offset by a decline in incentive compensation expense in fiscal operating income in the medical segment  operating income for fiscal declined by to million compared with million in fiscal the decrease was caused by lower medical sales volume  higher raw material costs and higher medical selling expenses in fiscal compared with last fiscal year 
the custom products segment showed a significant improvement in operating income  which rose to  in fiscal compared with an operating loss of  in fiscal the increase in custom products operating income was caused by across the board expense reductions in that segment as well as an increase in industrial sales volume 
within the custom products segment  we achieved cost reductions during the year in the categories of raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead as a result of ongoing efforts to improve material usage and yields and to increase manufacturing efficiencies 
we also adopted lean manufacturing techniques to reduce the number of employees required to meet production requirements 
operating income for the total company declined in fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal as discussed above  the decline in medical operating income was greater than the improvement in custom products operating income 
non operating income investment income declined by to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the decrease was caused by a significant reduction in the level of short term investments  which in turn was related to our per share special dividend paid in june the million special dividend was funded by liquidation of our short term investments and the addition of million in long term debt during fiscal interest expense interest expense in fiscal increased to  compared with  in fiscal the increase was caused by a higher average balance of long term debt in fiscal compared with since the addition of long term debt took place in june as described above  the debt was outstanding for only four months during fiscal year although we steadily reduced the debt level during fiscal  the average balance was higher in fiscal than in see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion about our revolving credit facility 
income from continuing operations  net income and dividends income from continuing operations in fiscal declined to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the decrease was caused by lower medical and custom products sales volume  higher raw material costs in the medical segment  higher medical selling expenses and lower investment income in fiscal compared with fiscal net income  which includes results from the discontinued safety catheter segment  increased in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the increase in net income was the result of discontinuing the safety catheter segment  which reduced our after tax loss from discontinued operations to  in fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  we paid dividends of  or of net income for the year 
this amount consisted of two quarterly dividends of per share and two quarterly dividends of per share 
in april  the board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by  from to per share 
liquidity and capital resources we generated cash from operations of million during fiscal  which represented a increase compared with cash flow of million in fiscal the major positive factor affecting cash flow from operations in fiscal was a decrease in accounts receivable during the year compared with an increase in that line item in the previous year 
the main negative factor affecting cash flow during fiscal was an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets compared with a decrease in that category during fiscal the balance sheet components of these changes are described below 
the main uses of cash provided by operations in fiscal were purchases of marketable securities of million  payment of dividends of  repayment of  of long term debt  stock repurchases of  and equipment purchases of  working capital increased by million  or  to million during fiscal the increase in working capital was primarily caused by a higher balance in securities available for sale 
in addition  our current ratio increased to at fiscal year end from at fiscal year end accounts receivable  net of allowances  decreased to million at the end of fiscal compared with million at the end of fiscal the decrease was partly the result of lower sales during fiscal compared with fiscal and partly due to the timing of customer payments received 
our accounts receivable balance was higher than usual at fiscal year end and lower than usual at fiscal year end  creating a slightly exaggerated decline in accounts receivable in fiscal the days sales outstanding or average collection time  calculated using a month average for trade accounts receivable balances  decreased slightly to days in compared with days in the shorter collection time is primarily due to normal month to month fluctuations in the timing of payments received and a higher percentage of custom products sales 
medical sales typically have longer collection times than custom products sales 
all of our accounts receivable are unsecured 
inventory  net of reserves  decreased by  to million at fiscal year end compared with million at fiscal year end the slight change was the result of decreases in raw material inventory for medical and industrial products  partially offset by increases in medical and industrial finished goods inventory 
inventory turns from continuing operations decreased slightly to times in fiscal compared with times in fiscal because our cost of sales decreased at a faster rate than our total inventory levels 
we expect inventory levels in fiscal to be similar to fiscal year end levels 
our deferred income tax asset increased by during fiscal to  from  due mostly to an increase in accrued incentive compensation 
the increase in accrued incentive compensation was caused by an increase in management bonuses in fiscal compared with fiscal prepaid expenses increased to  during fiscal from  at the end of fiscal the increase was the result of normal monthly fluctuations in prepaid accounts 
net property and equipment decreased by  or  during fiscal the change resulted from the combination of  in depreciation expense offset by capital expenditures of  we expect capital expenditure levels in fiscal to be similar to those of fiscal other assets increased by to million during fiscal compared with million at fiscal year end due to increases in deposits placed with raw material suppliers 
our accounts payable decreased by in fiscal to million due mostly to a decrease in raw material purchases in september accrued and sundry liabilities increased by during the year to million compared with million last year 
the increase was caused by higher accruals for incentive compensation and income taxes payable 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we repaid the remaining balance of  on our revolving line of credit  which was outstanding at fiscal year end as of october   we had no borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
the maximum principal amount we can borrow at any one time under the agreement is million 
the maturity date is june  the agreement is unsecured and accrues interest at a variable rate equal to day libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points depending on our leverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
the margin in effect during fiscal was basis points 
the interest rate  including the margin  at november   the last date at which interest expense was incurred  was 
interest only payments are required monthly 
there are no unused line fees associated with the revolver 
the agreement includes financial covenants relating to tangible net worth and leverage ratios 
the agreement restricts dividends  stock repurchases  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  indebtedness  liens  and capital expenditures see below 
violation of loan covenants could result in acceleration of the term of the agreement 
we have pledged to grant the bank a security interest in our accounts  instruments  and chattel paper upon its request in the event of a default as defined in the agreement 
we believe that we were in compliance with the loan covenants as of october  the credit facility restricts dividends and stock repurchases during any fiscal year to an aggregate amount of no more than of the sum of i our income from continuing operations for that fiscal year plus ii the absolute value of any aggregate after tax  non cash and extraordinary losses for that fiscal year 
as an exception to the restriction above  we may pay a regular quarterly dividend in an amount no greater than the previous quarter s regular dividend so long as we remain in compliance with the financial covenants after giving effect to the payment of the dividend 
we believe that funds on hand  funds generated from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility are adequate to finance our operations and expected capital requirements during fiscal and for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at october  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
for additional information regarding these obligations  see the referenced footnotes in the notes to financial statements under item below 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than more than dollars in thousands total year years years years operating lease obligations note purchase obligations note deferred compensation note total contractual obligations impact of inflation and cost of raw materials based on current conditions in the markets for our primary raw materials  we expect inflation to be a moderate factor for our operations in fiscal we experienced increases in the cost of polyurethane foam  our primary raw material  during the first quarter of  followed by cost decreases on selected raw materials later in fiscal we have been able to offset previous raw material cost increases through a combination of sales price increases  efficiency improvements and other expense reduction efforts 
however  we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset future cost increases  which could negatively affect our profitability 
the cost of polyurethane foam is indirectly influenced by oil prices 
however  other market factors also affect foam prices  including supply availability of component chemicals  demand for related products from domestic and international manufacturers  competition among domestic suppliers  our purchase volumes and regulatory requirements 
consequently  it is difficult for us to accurately predict the impact that inflation might have on our operations 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements that we prepare in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions also require the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make forecasts about future events and their estimated impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the accounting policies which are more fully described in the notes to financial statements included in this report  we have identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit evaluations are undertaken to set credit limits for all customers 
we regularly evaluate past due accounts included in our accounts receivable and provide what we estimate to be adequate reserves for doubtful accounts 
customer financial conditions may change and increase the risk of non collectibility and may require additional provisions  which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of october   our provision for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable  or  this compares with  or of total accounts receivable at fiscal year end inventories we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of future product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
as of october   our provision for excess and obsolete inventory represented approximately of total inventories  or  this compares with  or of total inventories at fiscal year end warranty obligations we warrant certain of our products for specific periods of time against manufacturing or performance defects 
we provide for the estimated future cost of warranty obligations in cost of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty cost represents our best estimate at the time of sale of the total cost that we will incur to repair or replace covered products or parts 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty cost is primarily based on historical experience as well as current information on repair costs 
actual warranty cost could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future  it would negatively affect operating results 
our actual warranty expense was approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal our accrued warranty costs at october   were  see note in the notes to financial statements for more information on product warranties 
impairment of goodwill we evaluate goodwill in our medical business unit for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of our medical business unit 
for fiscal year end  we determined that the fair value of the medical business unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no impairment charge was required 
in assessing the value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the medical business unit 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges  which would negatively impact operating results 
as of october   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
impairment of long lived assets impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group is greater than its fair value 
we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and is greater than its fair value  the asset is impaired and an impairment loss must be recognized 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in september of  which eliminated of the book value of the safety catheter assets 
we have attempted to sell the assets related to the safety catheter business  but our efforts so far have been unsuccessful 
proceeds from a future sale of these assets  if any  will be recorded as a gain on the disposition of assets from discontinued operations 
see notes and in the notes to financial statements 
present value of deferred compensation we are obligated under the terms of a retirement agreement to make fixed payments for the remaining lives of span america s founder and his ex wife as discussed in note deferred compensation in the notes to financial statements 
this obligation can be funded from internally generated cash or from the cash value of company owned life insurance policies  which had a value of million at october  see item a below and notes and in the notes to financial statements for more information on deferred compensation and the cash value of life insurance 
we have fully accrued the present value of the expected payments due over the combined estimated life expectancy of our founder and his ex wife 
in calculating this present value we used a discount rate of  which is an estimate of the effective long term rate of return on the portfolio 
if the actual rate of return was significantly lower than our estimate and we were required to accrue additional deferred compensation costs in the future  it would negatively affect operating results 
as of october   we had recorded a deferred compensation liability of approximately  including current and long term portions 
if we reduced the discount rate by  the deferred compensation liability would be increased by approximately  and pre tax income would be reduced by the same amount 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk in three areas our short term investments  cash value of life insurance  and our credit facility 
as of october   we had short term investments of million which were classified as available for sale 
these short term investments are high quality  highly liquid corporate commercial paper and bonds known as variable rate demand notes or low floaters 
the bonds are issued by municipalities or companies and are backed by letters of credit from federally insured banks 
the bonds carry the credit rating of the underlying bank and are therefore highly rated 
the interest rate on the bonds is a floating rate which is reset weekly or monthly  depending on the issue  by the re marketing agent based on market rates for comparable securities or through an auction process 
we can liquidate the bonds at any time with a settlement date of seven to days after the trade date 
using the level of securities available for sale at fiscal year end  a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates for one year would increase or decrease pre tax earnings by approximately  the effect of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates will vary from period to period with the dollar amount invested in our low floater portfolio 
we are exposed to financial market risk because our other assets at october  included million in cash value of life insurance  which is subject to market risk related to equity pricing and interest rate changes 
the cash value is generated from life insurance policies that are being used as the funding vehicle for a retirement program for span america s founder and former chairman 
see present value of deferred compensation above 
the cash value is invested in a combination of fixed income life insurance contracts and a portfolio of mutual funds managed by an insurance company 
the fixed income contracts are similar to fixed income bond funds and are therefore subject to interest rate and company risk 
the mutual fund portfolios invest in common stocks and bonds in accordance with their individual investment objectives 
these portfolios are exposed to stock market and interest rate risk similar to comparable mutual funds 
we believe that substantial fluctuations in equity markets and interest rates and the resulting changes in cash value of life insurance would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
during the fiscal year ended october   cash value of life insurance decreased by  creating after tax expense of approximately  our credit facility accrues interest at a variable rate equal to day libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points depending on our then applicable leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
the current margin is basis points 
interest is payable monthly 
there is no unused commitment fee associated with the line of credit 
an increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our financial condition and earnings to the extent that we had outstanding borrowings under the facility 
the degree of impact would vary depending on the level of the borrowings 
we repaid the outstanding balance of our long term debt during the first quarter of fiscal year unless we borrow under the facility or otherwise incur significant debt with a variable interest rate  a change in interest rates would have no material effect on our interest expense
