in addition to the historical information  the discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to applications of our critical accounting policies and factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors in item a of part i of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading developer and provider of clean and intelligent energy solutions 
we use our network operations center  or noc  to remotely manage and reduce electricity consumption across a network of commercial  institutional and industrial customer sites to enable a more information based and responsive  or intelligent  electric power grid 
our customers are electric power grid operators and utilities  as well as commercial  institutional and industrial end users of electricity 
our demand response and energy management solutions help optimize the balance of electric supply and demand and create a lower risk and more environmentally sound alternative to building additional power plants and transmission lines 
grid operators and utilities pay us a stream of recurring cash flows for managing demand response capacity that we share with participating end use customers 
we receive most of our revenues from these grid operators and utilities and we make payments to end users of electricity for both contracting to reduce electricity usage and actually doing so when called upon 
we build upon our position as a leading demand response solutions provider by using our noc and scalable technology platform to also deliver a portfolio of additional energy management solutions to our customers  including our monitoring based commissioning services  or mbcx solutions  energy procurement services  or eps solutions  and emissions tracking and trading support 
our mbcx solutions combine advanced metering applications  energy analytics and control to provide our end use customers with the ability to identify energy efficiency opportunities through the continuous analysis of such end use customers real time energy data 
our eps solutions provide our commercial  institutional and industrial customers located in restructured or deregulated markets throughout the united states with the ability to more effectively manage the energy supplier selection process  including energy supply product procurement and implementation 
since inception  our business has grown substantially 
with over  commercial  institutional and industrial customers across approximately  customer sites in our demand response network and over  megawatts  or mw  of demand response capacity under our management as of december   we believe that we are the largest national demand response solutions provider focused on the commercial  institutional and industrial market 
our total revenues increased from million to million to million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues derived from our energy management solutions increased from million to million to million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we continue to devote substantially all of our efforts toward the sale of our demand response and energy management solutions 
we have incurred cumulative net losses of million from inception to december  our net losses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
significant developments in in december  our board of directors approved a one time offer  which we refer to as the exchange offer  to our employees  including our executive officers  and directors to exchange option 
table of contents grants that had an exercise price per share that was equal to or greater than the higher of or the closing price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq global market on january  the exchange offer closed on january   and we exchanged options that had exercise prices equal to or greater than per share 
as a result  an aggregate of  options  with exercise prices ranging from to per share  were exchanged for an aggregate of  options with exercise prices per share of for employees who are not also executive officers of ours  for executive officers who are not also directors of ours and for our directors 
in october  james l 
turner was elected to serve as a member of our board of directors and was appointed to the nominating and governance committee of our board of directors 
in august  we and a subsidiary of ours entered into a million secured revolving credit and term loan facility with svb which provides for  among other things  revolving credit and term loan advances and letters of credit for our account 
our obligations under this credit facility are secured by all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries  excluding any intellectual property 
this credit facility replaced our credit facility with bluecrest 
in june  arthur w 
coviello  jr 
was elected to serve as a member of our board of directors and was appointed to the audit committee of our board of directors 
in may  we acquired of the membership interests of src  an energy procurement and risk management services provider 
the acquisition of src strengthens our position in a growing energy procurement services market and provides a local presence for us in the pjm service region 
in april  we were notified by the connecticut department of public utility control that the agreement  dated as of february   between cl p and enernoc for up to megawatts of demand response capacity was denied regulatory approval 
also in april  ferc issued an order accepting proposed changes to the market rules governing iso ne s day ahead load response program  effective february   which changes resulted in less opportunity for demand response to participate in this program 
in january  darren p 
brady commenced employment as our senior vice president and chief operating officer 
other significant developments in november  we successfully completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  of which we sold  shares and selling stockholders sold  shares 
this transaction resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in september  we acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of mde  an energy procurement service provider  for a total purchase price of approximately million  of which approximately million was paid in cash and the remainder of which was paid by the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
the acquisition of mde enables us to apply leading energy market intelligence as well as an online reverse auction technology platform  now called enernoc exchange  to help commercial  institutional  and industrial customers make more informed commodity purchasing decisions 
in may  we completed our ipo of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  which included the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option to purchase  shares and the sale of  shares by certain of our stockholders 
net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately million 
to further strengthen our technology platform  we acquired substantially all of the assets of ebidenergy  inc from trillium capital partners llc in february in may  we acquired 
table of contents certain of the assets of celerity energy partners llc  a demand response provider for grid operators and utilities  including all of the membership interests in celerity energy partners san diego llc 
this acquisition increased our base of end use customers and capacity under management in california 
revenues and expense components revenues we derive recurring revenues from the sale of our demand response and energy management solutions 
our revenues from our demand response solutions primarily consist of capacity and energy payments 
we derive revenues from demand response capacity that we make available in open market programs  which are open market bidding opportunities established by grid operators or utilities 
in these open market programs  grid operators and utilities generally seek bids from companies such as ours to provide demand response capacity based on prices offered in competitive bidding 
these opportunities are generally characterized by flexible capacity commitments and prices that vary by hour  by day  by month  by bidding period or by supplemental  new or modified programs 
in certain markets  we enter into long term capacity contracts with grid operators and utilities  generally ranging from three to years in duration  to deploy our demand response solutions 
where we operate in open markets  our revenues from demand response capacity payments generally vary month to month based upon our enrolled capacity and the market payment rate 
where we have a long term contract  we receive periodic capacity payments  which may vary monthly or seasonally  based upon enrolled capacity and predetermined payment rates 
under both long term contracts and open market programs  we receive capacity payments regardless of whether we are called upon to reduce demand for electricity from the electric power grid 
under both long term contracts and open market programs  we recognize revenue over the applicable delivery period  even where payments are made over a different period 
at least once per year  we demonstrate our capacity either through a demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
this demonstrated capacity is typically used to calculate the continuing periodic capacity payments to be made to us until the next demand response event or test establishes a new demonstrated capacity amount 
in most cases  we also receive an additional payment for the amount of energy usage that we actually curtail from the grid  we call this an energy payment 
the energy payment is based upon the amount of energy usage that we actually reduce from the electricity grid in kilowatt hours during the demand response event 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab no 
 in all of our arrangements  we do not recognize any revenues until we can determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be probable 
as program rules may differ for each contract and or region where we operate  we assess whether or not we have met the specific delivery requirements and defer revenues as necessary 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize demand response revenues when we have provided verification to the grid operator or utility of our ability to deliver the committed capacity under the agreement or open market program 
committed capacity is verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenues are recognized and future revenues become fixed or determinable and are recognized monthly until the next verification event 
in subsequent verification events  if our verified capacity is below the previously verified amount  the grid operator or utility customer will reduce future payments based on the adjusted verified capacity amounts 
the payments received from the grid operator or utility customer can be decreased or increased  up to the committed capacity amounts under the agreement or open market program  in connection with subsequent verification events 
revenues recognized between demand response events or tests are not subject to grid operator or utility customer refund 
as of december   we had over  mw under management in our demand response network  meaning that we had entered into definitive contracts with our commercial  institutional and 
table of contents industrial customers with respect to over  mw of demand response capacity 
in most of the markets in which we originally focused our growth  we generally begin earning revenues from our mw under management within approximately one month from the date on which we enable the mw  or the date on which we can reduce the mw from the electricity grid if called upon to do so 
an exception is the pjm forward capacity market  which is a market in which we materially increased our participation beginning in the first quarter of and in which we expect to continue to increase our participation and derive revenues for the foreseeable future 
because pjm operates on a june to may program year basis  a mw that we enable after june of each year will not begin earning revenue until june of the following year 
this results in a longer average lag time in our portfolio from the point in time when we consider a mw to be under management to when we earn revenues from the mw 
our portfolio of additional energy management solutions includes our eps and mbcx solutions  and emissions tracking and trading support 
our eps solutions provide our end use customers located in restructured or deregulated markets throughout the united states with the ability to more effectively manage the energy supplier selection process  including energy supply product procurement and implementation 
we receive a monthly fee from the competitive electricity provider based upon the actual consumption of electricity used by our end use customers or a consulting fee from the end use customer directly 
our mbcx solutions combine advanced metering applications  and energy analytics and control to provide our end use customers with the ability to identify energy efficiency opportunities through the continuous analysis of such end use customers real time energy data 
we also use our powertrak platform to deliver emissions tracking and trading support 
we generally receive either a subscription based fee or a percentage savings fee for these energy management solutions 
revenues derived from our energy management solutions increased from million to million to million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues generated from two fixed price contracts with  and open market sales to  iso ne  a grid operator customer  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues for the years ended december   and our two fixed price contracts with iso ne expired on may  in addition   and  respectively  of our total revenues for the years ended december   and were generated under a fixed price contract with cl p  which expired on december  we have enrolled a significant portion of the mw represented by our expired fixed price contracts with iso ne and cl p in other available demand response programs 
these programs have provided  and could continue to provide significantly lower capacity payments 
for example  capacity payments currently available under iso ne s real time demand response program are significantly lower than the capacity payments that were available under our expired fixed price contracts with iso ne and cl p 
during the years ended december   and  revenues generated from open market sales to pjm  a grid operator customer  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
under certain contracts and programs  such as pjm s emergency load response program  or elrp  the period during which we are required to perform may be shorter than the period over which we receive payments under that contract or program 
in these cases  we record revenue over the mandatory performance obligation period  and a portion of the revenues that has been earned is recorded and accrued as unbilled revenue 
our unbilled revenues of million at december  will be collected through may  cost of revenues cost of revenues for our demand response solutions consists primarily of payments that we make to our commercial  institutional and industrial customers for their participation in our demand response network 
we generally enter into three to five year contracts with our end use customers under which we deliver recurring cash payments to them for the capacity they commit to make available on demand 
we also generally make an additional payment when a customer reduces consumption of energy from 
table of contents the electric power grid 
the equipment and installation costs for our devices at our commercial  institutional and industrial customer sites are capitalized and depreciated over the lesser of the remaining term of the contract  for fixed contracts  or the estimated useful life of the equipment and this depreciation is also reflected in cost of revenues 
we also include the monthly telecommunications and data costs we incur as a result of being connected to our commercial  institutional and industrial sites and our internal payroll and related costs specifically allocated to a customer site 
cost of revenues for energy management solutions include third party services  equipment depreciation and the wages and associated benefits that we pay to our project managers for the performance of their services 
gross profit gross profit consists of our total revenues less our cost of revenues 
our gross profit has been  and will be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our demand response and energy management solutions  b the selling price of our solutions  c our cost of revenues  d the introduction of new clean and intelligent energy solutions and e our ability to open and enter new markets and regions and expand deeper into markets we already serve 
in addition  gross profit will be affected by the way in which we manage our portfolio of demand response capacity in certain supplemental demand response programs in which we participate 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of selling and marketing  general and administrative  and research and development expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
we grew from full time employees at december  to full time employees at december  to full time employees at december  we expect to continue to hire employees to support our growth for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we incur significant up front costs associated with the expansion of the number of mw under our management  which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
although we expect our overall operating expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we grow our mw under management and further increase our headcount  we expect our overall annual operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues as we leverage our existing employee base and continue generating revenues from our mw under management 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  b commissions  c travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  d marketing programs such as trade shows  and e other related overhead 
commissions are recorded as an expense when earned by the employee 
we expect increases in selling and marketing expenses in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of sales professionals and  to a lesser extent  increase our marketing activities 
we expect annual selling and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues as we leverage our current sales and marketing personnel 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and operations organizations  b facilities expenses  c accounting and legal professional fees  d depreciation and amortization and e other related overhead 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support continued growth and incur additional 
table of contents expenses related to being a public company  including increased audit and legal professional fees  costs of compliance with securities and other regulations  investor relations expenses  and higher insurance premiums 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues as we leverage our current infrastructure and employee base 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  related to our engineering organization  b payments to suppliers for design and consulting services  c costs relating to the design and development of new solutions and enhancement of existing solutions  d quality assurance and testing  and e other related overhead 
during the year ended december   and  we capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of software and development costs in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and the amount is included as software in property and equipment at december  we intend to continue to invest in our research and development efforts 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future  but to decrease as a percentage of total revenues in the long term 
stock based compensation effective as of january   we adopted the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r requires us to expense share based payment awards with compensation cost for share based payment transactions measured at fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded expenses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards to employees and non employees 
with respect to grants through december   a future expense of non vested options of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and a future expense of restricted stock awards of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
interest and other income interest and other income consist primarily of interest income earned on cash balances and other non operating income 
we historically have invested our cash in money market funds  municipal bonds and auction rate securities 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest on our debt facilities

for the year ended december   we recognized revenues of million from our participation in pjm demand response programs 
we had over megawatts enrolled in pjm demand response programs as of december  as compared to mw as of december   and we recognize capacity based revenue from pjm demand response programs over the pjm delivery period of june through september 
the remainder of the increase in our demand response solutions revenues for the year ended december  resulted from an increase in our mw under management in certain other operating areas  our expansion into new markets and programs  and energy payments in connection with a certain demand response event  offset by the expiration of our fixed price contracts with iso ne and a reduction in energy payments due to fewer demand response events being called as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   our energy management solutions revenues increased by million  or  as compared to the year ended december  approximately million and million  respectively  of this increase resulted from our acquisitions of mde  an energy procurement services provider  and src  an energy procurement and risk management services provider 
the remainder of the increase in our energy management solutions revenues for the year ended december  resulted from end use customers continuing to utilize our eps solutions  pursuant to which we evaluate our end use customers energy purchasing needs and assist them in procuring more cost effective electricity  and from revenues we received from providing our mbcx solutions  pursuant to which we evaluate end use customers energy utilization and operating flexibility to determine potential savings opportunities from implementing demand response  conserving energy and limiting peak demand 
we currently expect our revenues to increase in compared to as we seek to further increase our mw under management in all operating regions  including pjm where we had over megawatts enrolled in demand response programs as of december   enroll new end use customers in our demand response programs  continue to sell our energy management solutions to our new and existing demand response customers and pursue more favorable pricing opportunities 
although we expect our annual revenues to increase in as compared to  we currently expect that revenues for the first quarter of will be slightly lower than  or comparable to  the same period in  primarily as a result of our recognizing capacity based revenue from the elrp over its delivery period of june through september 
we currently expect increased revenues in our second and third fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the demand response market 

table of contents gross profit and gross margin the following table summarizes our gross profit and gross margin percentages for our demand response and energy management solutions for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  gross profit gross margin gross profit gross margin our gross profit increased during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  primarily due to our increased participation in pjm s demand response programs  under which we recognize capacity based revenue over the four month delivery period of june through september  as well as to the increase in our mw under management in other operating regions and more favorable contract terms with our commercial  institutional and industrial customers 
a significant portion of the increase in gross margin for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was attributable to the way in which we managed our portfolio of demand response capacity in certain supplemental demand response programs in which we participate 
the remainder of the increase in gross margin for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due to our higher gross margin energy management services business comprising a greater percentage of our overall revenues

although we expect our overall operating expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we grow our mw under management and further increase our headcount  we expect our overall operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues as we leverage our existing employee base and continue generating revenues from our mw under management 
in certain forward capacity markets in which we choose to participate  such as pjm  we may enable our commercial  institutional and industrial customers up to twelve months in advance of enrolling them in a particular program 
this market feature creates a longer average lag time across our portfolio from the point in time when we consider a mw to be under management to when we 
table of contents earn revenues from such mw 
because we incur selling and marketing and operational expenses  including salaries and related personnel costs  at the time of enrollment  we believe there may be a trend of higher up front costs than we have incurred historically

we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   our anticipated net cash flows from operating activities and amounts available under our credit and term loan facility with svb will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including investing activities  for at least the next months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  without limitation  the rate at which we sell our demand response solutions to utilities and grid operators and any letters of credit or security deposits required by those utilities and grid operators  the introduction and market acceptance of new demand response and energy management solutions  and the expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development activities 
to the extent that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our anticipated net cash flows from operating activities and amounts available under our credit and term loan facility with svb are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may be required to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings

for information on these commitments and contingent obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in appendix a to this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this annual report on form k 

table of contents we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with sab no 
in all of our arrangements  we do not recognize any revenues until we can determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be probable 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by the customer and us or an arrangement enforceable under the rules of an open market bidding program to be representative of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when service has been delivered to the customer and no post delivery obligations exist 
in instances where customer acceptance is required  delivery is deemed to have occurred when customer acceptance has been achieved 
fees are fixed or determinable 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment  we recognize revenues when the right to a refund or adjustment lapses 
if offered payment terms exceed our normal terms  we recognize revenues as the amounts become due and payable or upon the receipt of cash 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  revenues are deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash 
we enter into agreements and open market bidding programs to provide demand response solutions 
demand response revenues are earned based on our ability to deliver committed capacity 
energy event revenue is contingent revenue earned based upon the actual amount of energy provided during the energy event 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize demand response revenue when we have provided verification to the grid operator or utility of our ability to deliver the committed capacity which entitles us to payments under the contract or open market program 
committed capacity is verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenue is recognized and future revenue becomes fixed or determinable and is recognized monthly until the next demand response event or test 
in subsequent verification events  if our verified capacity is below the previously verified amount  the customer will reduce future payments based on the adjusted verified capacity amounts 
the payments received from the utility or grid operator customer can be decreased or increased  up to the committed capacity amounts under the contract or open market program  in connection with subsequent verification events 
ongoing demand response revenue recognized between demand response events or tests that are not subject to penalty or customer refund are recognized in revenue 
if the revenue is subject to refund  the revenue is deferred until the liability is resolved 
revenue from energy events is recognized when earned 
energy event revenue is deemed to be substantive and represents the culmination of a separate earnings process and is recognized when the energy event is initiated by the customer 

table of contents as described above  utility or grid operator customer contracts or open market programs may include performance guarantees 
we do not recognize any revenue prior to the successful completion of the performance requirement 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis  and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
provisions for allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expense 
if our historical collection experience does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables  our future provision for doubtful accounts could be materially affected 
to date  we have not incurred any significant write offs of accounts receivable and have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  business combinations when we acquire new businesses  we allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets  including intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  with any amount in excess of such allocations designated as goodwill 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
the use of different assumptions could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
all of our identifiable intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we use estimates in determining the value of goodwill and intangible assets  including estimates of useful lives of intangible assets  discounted future cash flows and fair values of the related operations 
we test goodwill for impairment at least once each year  under the guidance of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on the results of the test  we determined that no impairment had occurred  as the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the respective carrying value 
consistent with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  when impairment indicators exist  we evaluate our long lived assets for potential impairment 
for the year ended december   the carrying value of a portion of our demand response equipment and generation equipment exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows based upon their anticipated retirement dates 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of representing the difference between the demand response equipment and generation equipments carrying value and fair market value 
software development costs we capitalize eligible costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
we capitalize the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use 
table of contents computer software 
we amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software which is generally three years 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value and impairment of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  sfas no

in accordance with sfas no 
r  we recognize the compensation cost of stock based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
effective with our adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of stock options granted on and after the date of adoption 
as there was no public market for our common stock prior to the effective date of our ipo  we determined the volatility for options granted in  and based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted has been determined using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies  as well as the historical volatility of our common stock beginning january  the expected volatility for options granted during  and was 
the expected life of options has been determined utilizing the simplified method as prescribed by sab no 
 share based payment 
the expected life of options granted during the year ended december  was years 
the risk free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
for  the weighted average risk free interest rate used was 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period  whereas sfas no 
permitted companies to record forfeitures based on actual forfeitures  which was our historical policy under sfas no 
as a result  we applied an estimated forfeiture rate of for the years ended december   and in determining the expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded expenses of approximately million and million  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards to employees and non employees 
with respect to grants through december   a future expense of non vested options of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and a future expense of restricted stock awards of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for awards with graded vesting  we allocate compensation costs under sfas no 
r on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
accordingly  we amortized the fair value of each option over each option s service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we account for stock options issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees  or in conjunction with selling goods or services  which requires valuing and remeasuring such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we have incurred net losses since our inception 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
 which requires companies to recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
sfas no 
requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets  primarily resulting from net operating loss and credit carryforwards  and adjust our valuation allowance  if necessary 
once we utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  we would expect our provision for income tax expense in future periods to reflect an effective tax rate that will be significantly higher than past periods 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will potentially result in tax benefits that are currently difficult to predict 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no

this new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited

sfas r is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december  and may not be applied before that date 
the adoption of sfas no  r may have a significant impact on our accounting for future acquisitions
