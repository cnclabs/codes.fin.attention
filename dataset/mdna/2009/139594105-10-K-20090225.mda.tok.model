c ebitda consists of net income minus other income  net plus income tax expense benefit and plus depreciation and amortization 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on marketable securities  net of any interest expense for capital leases and notes payable 
we use ebitda as a measure of operating performance 
however  ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and when analyzing our operating performance  investors should use ebitda in addition to  and not as an alternative for  net income as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
furthermore  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments 
we believe ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets 
we believe ebitda presents a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance  because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  as it removes depreciation  amortization  interest and taxes  and in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management to compare our current operating results with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview background we are an exclusively online postsecondary education services company 
our wholly owned subsidiary  capella university  is a regionally accredited university that offers a variety of undergraduate and graduate degree programs primarily for working adults 
we were founded in  and in we established our wholly owned university subsidiary  then named the graduate school of america  to offer doctoral and master s degrees through distance learning programs in management  education  human services and interdisciplinary studies 
in  we launched our online format for delivery of our doctoral and master s degree programs over the internet 
in  our university subsidiary received accreditation from the north central association of colleges and schools later renamed the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools 
in  we began the expansion of our original portfolio of academic programs by introducing doctoral and master s degrees in psychology and a master of business administration degree 
in  to expand the reach of our brand in anticipation of moving into the bachelor s degree market  we changed our name to capella education company and the name of our university to capella university 
in  we introduced our bachelor s degree completion program in information technology  which provided instruction for the last two years of a four year bachelor s degree 
in  we introduced our bachelor s degree completion program in business 
in  we introduced our four year bachelor s degree programs in business and information technology  as well as three master s level specializations in education targeted at k teachers 
at december   we offered over  courses and degree programs with specializations at the undergraduate and graduate levels to more than  learners 
in november  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
in may  we completed a follow on offering of our common stock 
we implemented an enterprise resource planning erp system from through in which the final module was implemented in july during the first half of we commenced and completed a million stock repurchase program  and during the second half of we commenced an additional stock repurchase program for up to million of our common stock 
our key financial results metrics revenues 
revenues consist principally of tuition  application and graduation fees  and commissions we earn from bookstore and publication sales 
during each of  and tuition represented approximately of our revenues 
factors affecting our revenues include i the number of enrollments  ii the number of courses per learner  iii our degree and program mix  iv the number of programs and specializations we offer  v annual tuition adjustments  and vi the number of colloquia events and enrollments at each event 
enrollments for a particular time period are defined as the number of learners registered in a course on the last day of classes within that period 
we offer monthly start options for newly enrolled learners 
learners who start their program in the second or third month of a quarter transition to a quarterly schedule beginning in their second quarter 
enrollments are a function of the number of continuing learners at the beginning of each period and new enrollments during the period  which are offset by graduations  withdrawals and inactive learners during the period 
inactive learners for a particular period include learners who are not registered in a class and  therefore  are not generating revenues for that period  but who have not withdrawn from capella university 
we believe that our enrollments are influenced by the attractiveness of our program offerings and learning experience  the effectiveness of our marketing and recruiting efforts  the quality of our instructors  the number of 
table of contents programs and specializations we offer  the availability of federal and other funding  the length of our educational programs  the seasonality of our enrollments and general economic conditions 
the bachelor s program is currently our fastest growing program and we believe demand dynamics for the bachelor s program may be strengthened by the current economic environment 
the following is a summary of our learners as of the last day of classes for the years ended december   and year ended december  doctoral master s bachelor s other total tuition and fees 
our tuition rates vary by type and length of program and by degree level  such as doctoral  master s or bachelor s 
for all master s and bachelor s programs and for selected doctoral programs  tuition is determined by the number of courses taken by each learner 
for the academic year the academic year that began in july  prices per course generally ranged from  to  the price of the course will vary based upon the number of credit hours  the degree level of the program and the discipline 
for the academic year  the majority of doctoral programs were priced at a fixed quarterly amount of  per learner  regardless of the number of courses in which the learner was registered 
the fixed quarterly tuition for doctoral learners in their comprehensive exam or dissertation was  the reduced tuition rate for doctoral learners who have paid for quarters  completed all coursework except for their comprehensive exam or dissertation and met all colloquia requirements was per quarter 
based on prices from the academic year  we estimate that tuition is in the mid  range for a full four year bachelor s program  from approximately  to  for a master s program  and from approximately  to  for a doctoral program 
these amounts and ranges assume no reductions for transfer credits 
many of our learners reduce their total program costs at capella university by transferring credits earned at other institutions 
tuition increases generally ranged from to in the academic year as compared to the prior academic year 
tuition increases have not historically been  and may not in the future be  consistent across our programs and specializations due to market conditions or changes in operating costs that have an impact on price adjustments of individual programs or specializations 
capella university implemented a tuition increase generally ranging from to for the academic year the academic year that began in july 
the price increase resulted in prices per course generally ranging from  to  for master s  bachelor s and certificate programs 
the majority of doctoral programs were priced at a fixed quarterly amount of  per learner  regardless of the number of courses in which the learner was registered 
the fixed quarterly tuition for doctoral learners in their comprehensive exam or dissertation increased to  the reduced tuition rate for doctoral learners who have paid for quarters  completed all coursework except for their comprehensive exam or dissertation and met all colloquia requirements increased to per quarter 
based on prices from the academic year  we estimate that tuition is in the mid  range for a full four year bachelor s program  from approximately  to  for a master s program  and from approximately  to  for a doctoral program 
these amounts and ranges assume no reductions for transfer credits 
many of our learners reduce their total program costs at capella university by transferring credits earned at other institutions 
other in the table above refers primarily to certificate seeking learners 
certificate programs generally consist of four courses  and the price of a course depends on the number of credit hours  the degree level of the 
table of contents program and the discipline 
for the academic year  prices per course in certificate programs generally ranged from  to  for the academic year  prices per course in certificate programs did not change 
a large portion of our learners rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  predominantly title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in the years ended december    and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues calculated on a cash basis were attributable to funds derived from title iv programs 
in addition to title iv funding  our learners receive financial aid from other governmental sources  tuition reimbursement from their employers or the department of defense or finance their education with their own funds or through private financing institutions 
costs and expenses 
we categorize our costs and expenses as i instructional costs and services expenses  ii marketing and promotional expenses and iii general and administrative expenses 
instructional costs and services expenses are items of expense directly attributable to the educational services we provide our learners 
this expense category includes salaries and benefits of full time faculty  administrators and academic advisors  and costs associated with adjunct faculty 
instructional pay for adjunct faculty varies across programs and is primarily dependent on the number of learners taught 
instructional costs and services expenses also include costs of educational supplies  costs associated with academic records and other university services  and an allocation of facility  admissions and human resources costs  stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs that are attributable to providing educational services to our learners 
marketing and promotional expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in recruitment and promotion  as well as costs associated with advertising and the production of marketing materials related to new enrollments and current learners 
our marketing and promotional expenses are generally affected by the cost of advertising media  the efficiency of our marketing efforts  salaries and benefits for our sales personnel  and the number of advertising initiatives for new and existing academic programs 
marketing and promotional expenses also include an allocation of facility  admissions and human resources costs  stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs that are attributable to marketing and promotional efforts 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of employees engaged in corporate management  finance  compliance and other corporate functions  together with an allocation of facility and human resources costs  stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs attributable to such functions 
general and administrative expenses also include bad debt expense and any charges associated with asset impairments 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
factors affecting comparability we set forth below selected factors that we believe have had  or are expected to have  a significant effect on the comparability of recent or future results of operations introduction of new programs and specializations 
at december   learners seeking doctoral degrees represented approximately of our enrollment  while learners seeking master s and bachelor s degrees represented approximately and of our enrollment  respectively 
the higher concentration of learners in doctoral programs reflects our early emphasis on these programs 
in  we introduced three specializations in master s in business administration  including healthcare management  two bachelor s level 
table of contents specializations in accounting and information assurance and security  and two doctoral specializations in education servicing k teachers 
in  we launched six new degree programs and new specializations across our three vertical markets  including doctoral  master s  and bachelor s level programs in public safety and nine phd specializations 
at december   learners seeking doctoral  master s and bachelor s degrees represented approximately  and  respectively  of our enrollment 
in  we launched three new degree programs including a phd in counselor education and supervision and a master s degree in both human resource management and organizational development 
we also introduced new specializations across our three vertical markets 
we continue to see a slight mix shift in our enrollments from doctoral programs to master s and bachelor s programs 
relative to our doctoral programs  our master s and bachelor s programs have lower revenue per learner and higher marketing and promotional  learner recruitment and support costs 
at december   learners seeking doctoral  master s and bachelor s degrees represented approximately  and  respectively  of our enrollment 
we expect to introduce additional degree programs and specializations in the future 
we make investments in program and specialization development  support infrastructure and marketing and selling when introducing new programs and specializations  while associated revenues are dependent upon enrollment  which in many cases is lower during the period of new program and specialization introduction and development 
during the period of new program and specialization introduction and development  the rate of growth of revenues and operating income has been  and may be  adversely affected in part due to these factors 
as our newer programs and specializations develop  we anticipate increases in enrollment  more cost effective delivery of instructional and support services and more efficient marketing and promotional processes 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
during the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  contingencies  stock based compensation expense  other than temporary impairments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
tuition revenue represented approximately of our revenues recognized for each of the years ended december   and course tuition revenue is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the period of instruction  which is generally from one and a half to three months 
colloquia tuition revenue is recognized over the length of the colloquia  which ranges from two days to two weeks 
deferred revenue in any period represents the excess of tuition and fees received as compared to tuition and fees recognized in revenue on the consolidated statement of operations and is reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our learners to make required payments 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts amount based on an analysis of the accounts receivable detail and historical write off experience 

table of contents in establishing our credit practices  we seek to strike an appropriate balance between prudent learner credit policies and learner retention 
accordingly  we periodically review and alter learner credit policies to achieve that objective by restricting or expanding the availability of credit we extend 
changes to credit practices may impact enrollments  revenues  accounts receivables  our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 
if changes in credit practices result in higher receivable balances  if the financial condition of our learners deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts may be necessary  which will result in increased general and administrative expenses in the period such determination is made 
as of december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million  and million respectively 
during   and  we recognized bad debt expense of million  million and million  respectively 
contingencies 
we accrue for costs associated with contingencies including  but not limited to  regulatory compliance and legal matters when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
we base these accruals on management s estimate of such costs  which may vary from the ultimate cost and expenses associated with any such contingency 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted fas r using the modified prospective method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values of the share award on the date of grant 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued sab  relating to fas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of fas r 
under fas r  the amount of compensation expense will vary depending on numerous factors  including the number and vesting period of option grants  the expected life of the grants  the publicly traded stock price of the security underlying the options  the volatility of the stock price and the estimated forfeiture rate 
prior to our initial public offering in november  the valuation used to determine the fair market value of our common stock at each grant date was performed internally and contemporaneously with the issuance of the stock options 
we issued options in january through september  that were priced at per share of common stock 
the fair value of our service based stock options was estimated as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions year ended december  expected life in years expected volatility risk free interest rate dividend yield weighted average fair value of options granted for the years ended december   and  the expected option life was determined using the simplified method for estimating expected option life for service based stock options 
as our stock had not been publicly traded prior to november  the expected volatility assumption for the years ended december   and reflects a detailed evaluation of the stock price of our peer group of public postsecondary education companies for a period equal to the expected life of the options  starting from the date they went public 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 

table of contents the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of regular dividend payments 
the assumptions discussed above were also used to value the performance based stock options granted during the year ended december  except for the expected life  which was four years 
the expected option life for performance based stock options was determined based on the evaluation of certain qualitative factors including our historical experience and our competitors historical experience 
the weighted average fair value of performance based stock options granted was 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the years ended december   and included compensation expense for stock based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of fas and compensation expense for the stock based payment awards granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
as stock based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in determining stock based compensation expense  fas r will continue to require significant management judgment and assumptions concerning such factors as expected term  expected volatility and forfeitures 
marketable securities other than temporary impairments 
available for sale marketable securities are carried at fair value as determined by quoted market prices or other observable inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace for identical or similar assets  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
management reviews the fair value of the portfolio at least monthly  and evaluates individual securities for declines in fair value that may be other than temporary  considering factors such as current and expected future interest rates  external credit ratings  interest and dividend payments  the performance of underlying collateral  if any  the financial health of the issuer and other pertinent information  including current developments with respect to the issuer  as well as the duration of the decline and management s intent and ability to hold the security 
if declines are deemed other than temporary  an impairment loss is recognized and the current fair value becomes the new cost basis 
unrealized losses considered to be other than temporary are recognized in earnings 
accounting for income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
at both the adoption date of january  and december   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
of this total  million net of the federal benefit on state issues  represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
as of december   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
of this total  million net of the federal benefit on state issues  represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
the company is subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions 
during  the internal revenue service irs commenced an income tax audit as well as an employment tax audit of capella university 
in addition  several states have commenced income tax audits 
the company continues to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
upon adoption of fin  the company had less than thousand of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions 
the company recognized million and thousand in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense during the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents for federal purposes  the statute of limitations remains open on tax years in addition  for federal purposes  tax years remain open to examination as a result of earlier net operating losses being utilized in recent years 
the statute of limitations remains open on the earlier years for three years subsequent to the utilization of net operating losses 
for state purposes  the statute of limitations remains open in a similar manner for states that have generated net operating losses 
the company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
in september  the statute of limitations expired on federal issues related to tax years and tax years with no material impact on the unrecognized tax benefits 
in september  the statute of limitations will expire on federal issues related to tax years and tax year with no material impact expected on the unrecognized tax benefits 
we account for income taxes utilizing fas  which prescribes the use of the asset and liability method to compute the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts  using currently enacted tax laws 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income offset by deferred tax liabilities 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets or other elements of the tax provision 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to examination by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes in income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels  among other things  could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods indicated year ended december  revenues costs and expenses instructional costs and services marketing and promotional general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  of this increase  percentage points were due to increased enrollments and percentage points were due to tuition increases  which was partially offset by a percentage point decrease due to a larger proportion of master s and bachelor s learners  who generated less revenue per learner than our doctoral learners 
end of period enrollment increased in compared to tuition increases in generally ranged from to and were implemented during july tuition increases in generally ranged from to and were implemented during july instructional costs and services expenses 
our instructional costs and services expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to instructional costs and services expenses of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher instructional pay and learner support services resulting from increased enrollments 
in addition  there were greater depreciation and learner support services expenses related to our erp implementation and greater information technology expenses as a result of the mix of projects which resulted in higher expense versus capital ratios in compared to our instructional costs and services expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  this improvement in was driven by a decrease in accrued bonus expense and a decrease in the ratio between faculty compensation and revenue  offset by higher financial aid support  learner support services  and depreciation expenses related to the erp implementation 
marketing and promotional expenses 
our marketing and promotional expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to marketing and promotional expenses of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to greater spending in online media and recruitment staffing 
our marketing and promotional expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily due to improved efficiencies in inquiry spending and a decrease in accrued bonus expense  partially offset by inefficiencies we experienced in the selling process earlier in the year as we implemented the erp system 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in bad debt expense due to higher credit limits granted to learners in in recognition of inconveniences associated with the implementation of the erp system and increased expense for certain other contingencies  offset by a decrease in accrued bonus expense 
our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage point to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   due to a decrease in accrued bonus expense and information technology expenses as there were fewer employees dedicated to the erp system implementation  partially offset by increased expense for certain other contingencies and an increase in bad debt expense due to higher credit limits granted to learners earlier in in recognition of inconveniences associated with the implementation of the erp system 
other income  net 
other income  net decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was principally due to lower interest rates partially offset by interest income on higher average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 
table of contents income tax expense 
we recognized tax expense for the year ended december  and of million and million  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the slight increase in our effective tax rate from to was primarily due to a decrease in the favorable impact of tax exempt interest offset by a decrease in the impact of non deductible fas r expense related to incentive stock options 
net income 
net income was million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  because of the factors discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  of this increase  percentage points were due to increased enrollments and percentage points were due to tuition increases  which were partially offset by a percentage point decrease due to a larger proportion of master s and bachelor s learners  who generated less revenue per learner than our doctoral learners

our instructional costs and services expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to instructional costs and services expenses of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in learner support services and increases in instructional pay as a result of the increase in enrollments  as well as an increase in information technology expenses and depreciation due to the implementation of additional modules of our enterprise resource planning system  and an increase in bonus expense due to higher amounts earned in than in our instructional costs and services expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in was driven by improvements in our variable cost structure due to ongoing work on process improvements  including more efficient course scheduling and use of faculty and the termination of our relationship with a third party service provider  a decrease in the ratio between faculty pay and revenue and increased efficiencies in our information technology department 
marketing and promotional expenses 
our marketing and promotional expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to marketing and promotional expenses of million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by greater spending in online media  an increase in recruitment and marketing staffing  and an increase in bonus expense due to a higher expected payout in than in our marketing and promotional expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   due to efficiency improvements across marketing enrollment spending  partially offset by an increase in recruitment and marketing staffing and an increase in bonus expense due to higher amounts earned in than in general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to being a public company  higher legal costs  and an increase in bonus expense due to higher amounts earned in than our year over year legal costs increased  in part  due to activity in an on going litigation matter initiated by a former learner  which litigation included both his claims against us and our counterclaims against him 
in november  the trial court granted 
table of contents a directed verdict in our favor on all claims against us 
our insurance carrier had denied coverage of the legal costs for this matter  and we have been in litigation with the carrier to require coverage under our insurance policy 
on january   we received a lower court ruling requiring that the insurance carrier cover our defense costs for this litigation matter 
the court has not yet determined the specific dollar amount that we will receive to cover defense costs already incurred 
our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   due to a decrease in certain contingency expenses 
other income  net 
other income  net increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased levels of interest income on higher average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  partially offset by lower levels of interest income from the higher proportion of tax exempt investments in income tax expense 
we recognized tax expense for the year ended december  and of million and million  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in from was primarily due to the increased use of tax exempt investments  a decrease in the impact of non deductible fas r stock based compensation expense for incentive stock options and a decrease in the amount of non deductible meals and entertainment expenses 
net income 
net income was million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  because of the factors discussed above 
quarterly results and seasonality the following tables set forth certain unaudited financial and operating data each quarter during the years ended december  and the unaudited information reflects all adjustments  which include only normal and recurring adjustments  necessary to present fairly the information shown 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except for per share and enrollment data revenues operating income net income net income per common share basic diluted enrollment revenues operating income net income net income per common share basic diluted enrollment our revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to changes in enrollment 
learner population varies as a result of new enrollments  graduations 
table of contents and learner attrition 
while the number of enrollments has grown in each sequential quarter over these periods  the sequential quarterly increase in enrollments has been the greatest in the fourth quarter of each respective year  which corresponds with a traditional fall school start 
the larger relative increases in enrollments in the fourth quarter have resulted in larger sequential increases in revenue during the fourth quarter than in other quarters 
a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses does not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues  resulting in larger relative increases in operating income in the fourth quarter relative to increases between other quarters 
in addition  we typically implement tuition increases at the beginning of an academic year  which coincides with the start of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of these seasonal patterns 
in addition to our recurring seasonal patterns described above  our quarterly revenue may be impacted by the timing of our colloquia tuition revenue  as evidenced in the first and second quarters of  resulting from two days to two week long gatherings of our doctoral learners for in depth  face to face instruction 
we typically have eight to ten colloquia per year 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future based on the timing and number of our colloquia 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we financed our operating activities and capital expenditures during the years ended december   and primarily through cash provided by operating activities 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million and million at december  and respectively 
we maintain an unsecured million line of credit with wells fargo bank 
the line of credit expires on june  there have been no borrowings to date under this line of credit 
any borrowings would bear interest at a rate of either libor plus or the bank s prime rate  at our discretion on the borrowing date 
an unsecured letter of credit in the amount of million  which expires on july   was issued under the million line of credit in favor of the department of education in connection with its annual review of student lending activities 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from title iv programs 
federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements under title iv programs 
learners must apply for new loans and grants each academic year  which starts july loan funds are generally provided by lenders in multiple disbursements for each academic year 
the disbursements are usually received by the start of the second week of the term 
these factors  together with the timing of our learners beginning their programs  affect our operating cash flow 
based on current market conditions and recent regulatory or legislative actions  we do not anticipate any significant disruptions in the availability of title iv funding for our learners 
based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that our cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
if needed  to fund our operations or to fund strategic investments  we also believe that we could further supplement our liquidity position with debt 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased net income of million  million increase in deferred revenue due to higher revenue year over year and an increase in new enrollments during the fourth quarter  increased cash flow from the change in prepaid expenses due to a large prepaid marketing invoice at the end of  increased depreciation expense due to the erp implementation of million  and million fewer excess tax benefits from stock option exercises due to fewer stock option 
table of contents exercises in than in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which was comprised primarily of an million decrease in cash flows from the change in amounts and components of accrued bonus expense  million decrease from timing of accounts payable and a million decrease in accrued instructional payments related to a change in payment timing 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the million increase in net income  a million increase in related to various working capital items  and a million increase in depreciation expense 
this was offset by a million decrease in income taxes payable related primarily to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation due to an increase in stock option exercises in compared to investing activities our cash used in investing activities is primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment and investment in marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
investment in marketable securities at december  consisted of purchases  sales and maturities of tax exempt municipal securities 
net purchases of these securities were million million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
we believe that the credit quality and liquidity of our investment portfolio is currently strong 
due to current market conditions  the unrealized gains and losses of the portfolio may remain volatile as supply demand fluctuations impact daily market valuations 
to mitigate the risk associated with this market volatility  we deploy a relatively conservative investment strategy focused on capital preservation and liquidity 
but even with this approach  we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further in this time of economic uncertainty 
in addition  these unusual and unpredictable market developments may also create liquidity challenges for certain of the assets in our investment portfolio 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily due to the mix of projects as a result of the completion of the erp implementation in the increase from to was due to the investments in integrating most of our business systems with our erp system 
we expect capital expenditures to decrease from levels to approximately to percent of revenue  as our heavy capital investment period in our systems infrastructure was completed in we lease all of our facilities 
we expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
financing activities during were primarily related to the repurchase of common stock in the amount of million  partially offset by million in proceeds from stock option exercises and million in excess tax benefits from stock option exercises 
financing activities during were primarily related to proceeds of million from stock option exercises and the related excess tax benefits of million  and net cash proceeds from our follow on offering of common stock of million  after deducting underwriter commissions and offering expenses 
financing activities during were primarily related to net cash proceeds from our initial public offering  after deducting underwriter commissions and offering expenses  of 
table of contents million and net proceeds of million from stock option exercises 
net proceeds from the initial public offering were largely offset by the special distribution paid in november of million and million of payments on two notes payable  which we entered into in to finance asset purchases related to our enterprise resource planning system 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   the aggregate amounts of our significant contractual obligations and commitments with definitive payment terms due in each of the periods presented payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases a total contractual obligations a minimum lease commitments for our headquarters and miscellaneous office equipment 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
regulation and oversight we perform periodic reviews of our compliance with the various applicable regulatory requirements 
we have not been notified by any of the various regulatory agencies of any significant noncompliance matters that would adversely impact its ability to participate in title iv programs  however  the office of inspector general oig has conducted a compliance audit of capella university for the three financial aid years through the audit commenced on april  and we subsequently provided the oig with periodic information  responded to follow up inquiries and facilitated site visits and access to the company s records 
the oig completed its field work in january and the company received a draft audit report on august  capella university provided written comments on the draft audit report to the oig on september  on march   the oig s final report was issued to the acting chief operating officer coo for federal student aid fsa  which is responsible for primary oversight of the title iv funding programs 
we responded to the final report on april  recently  the company provided fsa staff with certain requested information for financial aid years through the fsa will subsequently issue final findings and requirements for capella university 
the fsa may take certain actions  including requiring that we refund certain federal student aid funds  requiring us to modify our title iv administration procedures  and or requiring us to pay fines or penalties 
based on the final audit report for the financial aid years through  the most significant potential financial exposure pertains to repayments to the department of education that could be required if the fsa concludes that capella university did not properly calculate the amount of title iv funds required to be returned for learners that withdrew without providing an official notification of such withdrawal and without engaging in the course room prior to such withdrawal 
if the fsa determines that capella university improperly withheld any portion of these funds  capella university would be required to return the improperly withheld funds 
we and the oig have differing interpretations of the relevant regulations regarding what constitutes engagement in the unofficial withdrawal context 
as we interpret the engagement requirement  the company currently estimates that for the three year audit period  and for the subsequent aid years through  the 
table of contents total amount of title iv funds not returned for learners who withdrew without providing official notification and without engaging as required in the relevant regulations was approximately million including interest  but not including fines and penalties 
if this difference of interpretation is ultimately resolved in a manner adverse to us  then the total amount of title iv funds not returned for learners who withdrew without providing official notification would be greater than the amount we have currently estimated 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december    or there can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
fsp eitf clarifies unvested share based payment awards that entitle holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are considered participating securities and should be included in the computation of eps pursuant to the two class method 
the two class method of computing eps is an earnings allocation formula that determines eps for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings 
fsp eitf requires retrospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
fsp eitf is effective for us on january  we do not expect that the adoption of fsp eitf will have a material impact on our calculation of eps and related disclosures 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas this fsp defers the effective date in fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
fsp fas will be effective for us beginning january  we do not expect that the adoption of fsp fas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of sfas  which we adopted as of january   in cases where a market is not active 
we have considered the guidance provided by fsp in its determination of estimated fair values as of december   and the impact was not material as we do not hold securities in inactive markets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we believe the risk related to cash equivalents and marketable securities is limited due to the adherence to our investment policy which focuses on capital preservation and liquidity 
in addition  all investments must have a minimum standard poor s rating of a minus or equivalent 
all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  and were rated a minus or higher 
in addition  we utilize money managers who conduct 
table of contents initial and ongoing credit analysis on our investment portfolio to monitor and minimize the potential impact of market risk associated with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
despite the investment risk mitigation strategies we employ  we may incur investment losses as a result of these unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further in this time of economic uncertainty 
in addition  these unusual and unpredictable market developments may also create liquidity challenges for certain of the assets in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk we manage interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents and marketable securities bearing a combination of fixed and variable interest rates 
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates and other market dynamics 
at december   a increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair values  or cash flows
