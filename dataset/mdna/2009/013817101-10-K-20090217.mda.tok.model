alcoa consumes substantial amounts of energy in its operations 
although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from long term contracts  the following could affect alcoa s results of operations significant increases in electricity costs rendering smelter operations uneconomic  significant increases in natural gas prices  unavailability of electrical power or other energy sources due to droughts  hurricanes or other natural causes  unavailability of energy due to energy shortages resulting in insufficient supplies to serve consumers  interruptions in energy supply due to equipment failure or other causes  or curtailment of one or more refineries or smelters due to inability to extend energy contracts upon expiration or negotiate new arrangements on cost effective terms 
alcoa s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials or by significant lag effects for decreases in commodity or lme linked costs 
alcoa s results of operations will be affected by increases in the cost of raw materials  including energy  carbon products  caustic soda and other key inputs  as well as freight costs associated with transporting raw materials to refining and smelting locations 
alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases  productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 
similarly  alcoa s operating results will be affected by significant lag effects for declines in key costs of production that are commodity or lme linked 
for example  declines in lme linked costs of alumina and power in a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period 
alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its brazilian growth projects or realize expected benefits from its portfolio streamlining strategy 
as a result of the current global economic downturn and as part of the company s initiative to conserve cash  alcoa has halted all non critical capital investment  except for the completion of the s o lu s refinery expansion and the greenfield juruti bauxite mine in brazil  which are targeted for completion in the first half of there can be no assurance that these projects will be completed within budget or by the targeted completion date  or that they will be beneficial to alcoa  whether due to a further deteriorating global economic environment  lack of financing  increases in construction costs  currency fluctuations  or other factors 
in addition  as part of its strategy to strengthen its competitiveness  alcoa has announced restructuring actions to streamline its portfolio and an agreement to exchange assets to increase alcoa s smelter capacity while divesting itself of a business that operates in a difficult market 
there can be no assurance that these actions will be beneficial to alcoa  that targeted completion dates will be met  or that estimated proceeds from asset sales will be realized 
alcoa s global operations are exposed to political and economic risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates 
alcoa has operations or activities in numerous countries outside the us having varying degrees of political and economic risk  including china  guinea and russia  among others 
risks include those associated with political instability  civil unrest  expropriation  nationalization  renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements  mining leases and permits  and changes in local government laws  regulations and policies  including those related to tariffs 
table of contents and trade barriers  taxation  exchange controls  employment regulations and repatriation of earnings 
while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict  any one or more of them could adversely affect alcoa s business  financial condition or operating results 
alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 
economic factors  including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates  and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment  could affect alcoa s revenues  expenses and results of operations 
changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies  particularly the brazilian real  canadian dollar  euro and australian dollar  may affect profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies  while products generally are sold in us dollars 
a reduction in chinese demand may negatively impact alcoa s results 
the chinese market is a significant source of global demand for commodities 
a sustained slowdown in china s economic growth  whether as part of the current global economic downturn or otherwise  could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices 
in addition  china s investments to increase its self sufficiency in key commodities may impact future demand and supply balances and prices 
alcoa faces significant competition 
as discussed in part i  item business competitive conditions of this report  the markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive 
alcoa s competitors include a variety of both us and non us companies in all major markets 
in addition  aluminum competes with other materials  such as steel  plastics  composites  and glass  among others  for various applications in alcoa s key markets 
the willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by alcoa  the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products  or other developments by or affecting alcoa s competitors or customers could affect alcoa s results of operations 
further metals industry consolidation could impact alcoa s business 
the metals industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years  and there may be further industry consolidation in the future 
although current industry consolidation has not negatively impacted alcoa s business  further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict 
alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 
a significant downturn or further deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa  as a result of the current global economic and financial crisis or otherwise  could affect alcoa s results of operations in a particular period 
alcoa s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products  labor strikes  diminished liquidity or credit unavailability  weak demand for their products  or other difficulties in their businesses 
if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers  profitability may be adversely affected 
alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings  investigations or changes in law 
alcoa s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws  regulatory requirements or interpretations  or significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to alcoa

these risks include  among other things  potential claims 
table of contents relating to product liability  health and safety  environmental matters  intellectual property rights  government contracts  taxes  and compliance with us and foreign export laws  competition laws and sales and trading practices 
alcoa could be subject to fines  penalties  damages in certain cases  treble damages  or suspension or debarment from government contracts 
while alcoa believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks  the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time 
alcoa s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings  changes in law or other contingencies that it cannot predict with certainty 
alcoa is subject to a broad range of health  safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws 
alcoa s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health  safety and environmental laws and regulations 
the costs of complying with such laws and regulations  including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites  as well as internal voluntary programs  are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future 
alcoa s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health  safety or environmental matters  including remediation costs and damages related to several sites 
additionally  evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation and or increased costs  all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows 
climate change  climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact alcoa s operations and markets 
energy is a significant input in a number of alcoa s operations 
there is growing recognition that energy consumption is a contributor to global warming  greenhouse effects and potentially climate change 
a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change 
there is also current and emerging regulation  such as the mandatory renewable energy target in australia  or potential carbon trading regimes that will affect energy prices 
alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gas intensive assets and energy intensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates 
these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact alcoa s operations directly or indirectly through customers 
inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the company s assets 
assessments of the potential impact of future climate change regulation are uncertain  given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which alcoa operates 
the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company s operations are highly uncertain  and will be particular to the geographic circumstances 
these may include changes in rainfall patterns  water shortages  changing sea levels  changing storm patterns and intensities  and changing temperature levels 
these effects may adversely impact the cost  production and financial performance of alcoa s operations 
alcoa could be required to make additional contributions to its defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets 
alcoa s estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other post retirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  medical costs  retirement age and mortality 
alcoa s results of operations  liquidity or shareholders equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets  the rate used to discount the future estimated liability or changes in employee workforce assumptions 

table of contents union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa s financial results 
some of alcoa s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates 
alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire 
in addition  existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa s facilities in the future 
alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements 
any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on alcoa s financial results 
alcoa may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and cost reduction initiatives 
alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and cost reduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash  including new procurement strategies for raw materials  such as backward integration and non traditional sourcing from numerous geographies  and deployment of company wide business process models  such as the alcoa business system and the alcoa enterprise business solution an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across alcoa for data  processes and supporting software 
there can be no assurance that these initiatives will be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 
alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement new technology initiatives 
alcoa is working on new developments in advanced smelting process technologies  including inert anode and carbothermic technology  in addition to multi alloy casting processes 
there can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 
unexpected events may increase alcoa s cost of doing business or disrupt alcoa s operations 
unexpected events  including fires or explosions at facilities  natural disasters  war or terrorist activities  unplanned outages  supply disruptions  or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications  may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact alcoa s financial performance

alcoa believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations 
although no title examination of properties owned by alcoa has been made for the purpose of this report  the company knows of no material defects in title to any such properties

corporate see the table and related text in the corporate facilities section on page item legal proceedings 
in the ordinary course of its business  alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims  both actual and potential  including some that it has asserted against others 
while the amounts claimed may be substantial  the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist 
it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies 
management believes  however  that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
environmental matters as previously reported  alcoa is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  also known as superfund cercla or analogous state provisions regarding the usage  disposal  storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate  or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation  in clean up efforts at several such sites 
as previously reported  since  alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the grasse river  adjacent to alcoa s massena  new york plant site  under order from the us environmental protection agency epa issued under section of cercla 
sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb 
in early  alcoa submitted a revised analysis of alternatives report to epa 
this report identified potential remedial actions related to pcb contamination of the river  including additional remedial alternatives that may be required by epa 
it also reflected certain recent studies and investigations on the river  including pilot tests of 
table of contents sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies 
the range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the report was between million and million 
alcoa believes that rational  scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or man made processes 
because the selection of the million alternative natural recovery was considered remote  the company adjusted the reserve for the grasse river in to million representing the low end of the range of possible alternatives  as no single alternative could be identified as more probable than the others 
in june  based on then recent river observations  epa requested that alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup so that it could be factored into the range of remedial alternatives being considered 
the results of these additional studies  submitted in a report to epa in april  suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios 
those evaluations were submitted to epa along with a proposal to perform additional pilot remedial studies in the river 
in may  epa approved alcoa s proposed remedial options pilot study rops that includes sediment removal and capping  the installation of an ice control structure  and significant monitoring 
at the same time  alcoa adjusted the reserve for the river to include the million estimated cost of the rops  in addition to the million previously reserved 
most of the construction work for the rops was completed in with monitoring through the reserves for the grasse river were re evaluated in the fourth quarter of and an adjustment of million was made 
this adjustment covered commitments made to the epa for additional investigation work for the ongoing monitoring program  including that associated with the rops program  to prepare a revised analysis of alternatives report  and for an interim measure that involves  annually  the mechanical ice breaking of the river to prevent the formation of ice jams until a permanent remedy is selected 
epa has since eliminated the ice breaking requirement 
the findings from the rops program and from these additional investigations were incorporated into a revised analysis of alternatives report that was submitted to epa in this update incorporated new information obtained from the rops regarding the feasibility and costs associated with various capping and dredging alternatives and incorporated various options for ice control 
epa will use this information to develop a remedy for the river 
alcoa adjusted the reserve in the fourth quarter of by an additional million for increases associated with updated cost for a proposed remedy incorporating ice control and for partial settlement of potential resource damages 
the epa s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability 
alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the epa s record of decision is issued  which is expected in or later 
as previously reported  representatives of various us federal and state agencies and a native american tribe  acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources  have asserted that alcoa and reynolds metals company reynolds may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on alcoa s and reynolds operations at their massena  new york and st

as previously reported  in september  hurricane georges struck the us virgin islands  including the st 
croix alumina  us sca facility on the island of st 
croix 
the wind and rain associated with the hurricane caused material at the location to be blown into neighboring residential areas 
various cleanup and remediation efforts were undertaken by or on behalf of sca 
a notice of violation was issued by the division of environmental protection of the department of planning and natural resources of the virgin islands government  and has been contested by the company 
a civil suit was commenced in the territorial court of the virgin islands by certain residents of st 
croix in february seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief for alleged personal injuries and property damages associated with bauxite or red dust from the sca facility 
the suit  which has been removed to the district court of the virgin islands the court  names sca  alcoa inc  and glencore ltd 
as defendants  and  in august  was accorded class action treatment 
the class is defined to include persons in various defined neighborhoods who suffered damages and or injuries as a result of exposure during and after hurricane georges to red dust and red mud blown during hurricane georges 
all of the defendants have denied liability  and discovery and other pretrial proceedings have been underway since in october  the defendants received plaintiffs expert reports 
these reports also claim that the material blown during hurricane georges consisted of bauxite and red mud  and contained crystalline silica  chromium  and other substances 
the reports further claim  among other things  that the population of the six subject neighborhoods as of the 
table of contents census a total of  people has been exposed to toxic substances through the fault of the defendants  and hence will be able to show entitlement to lifetime medical monitoring as well as other compensatory and punitive relief 
these opinions have been contested by the defendants expert reports  that state  among other things  that plaintiffs were not exposed to the substances alleged and that in any event the level of alleged exposure does not justify lifetime medical monitoring 
in august  alcoa and sca moved to decertify the plaintiff class  and in march  the assigned magistrate judge issued a recommendation that class certification be maintained for liability issues only  and that the class be decertified after liability issues have been resolved 
this recommendation has been adopted by the assigned district judge 
alcoa and sca have turned over this matter to their insurance carriers who are providing a defense 
glencore ltd 
is jointly defending the case with alcoa and sca and has a pending motion to dismiss 
on june   the court granted defendants joint motion to decertify the class of plaintiffs  and simultaneously granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs motion for certification of a new class 
under the new certification order  there is no class as to the personal injury  property damage  or punitive damages claims 
the named plaintiffs had previously dropped their claims for medical monitoring during the course of the briefing of the certification motions 
the court did certify a new class as to the claim of on going nuisance  insofar as plaintiffs seek cleanup  abatement  or removal of the red mud currently present at the facility 
the court expressly denied certification of a class as to any claims for remediation or clean up of any area outside the facility including plaintiffs property 
the new class may seek only injunctive relief rather than monetary damages 
named plaintiffs  however  may continue to prosecute their claims for personal injury  property damage  and punitive damages

the new italian power tariff modifies the preferential tariff that was in force until december  and extends it through alcoa has been operating in italy for more than years under a power supply structure approved by the ec in that measure  like the new one  was based on italian state legislation that provides a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and is not considered state aid by the italian government 
the ec s announcement states that it has doubts about the measure s compatibility with eu legislation and concerns about distortion of competition in the european market of primary aluminum  where energy is an important part of the production costs 
the opening of an in depth investigation gives interested parties the opportunity to comment on the proposed measures 
it does not prejudge the outcome of the procedure 
it is alcoa s understanding that the italian government s continuation of the electricity tariff was done in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations 
alcoa believes that the total potential impact from a loss of the tariff would be approximately million  or million  pre tax per month in higher power costs at its italian smelters 
the estimated total potential impact has increased since due predominantly to the weakening of the us dollar  as the liability would be payable in euros in the event of a negative outcome 
while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed prospectively from the date of the ec s decision on this matter  it is possible that the ec could rule that the assessment must be retroactively applied to january if the ec s investigation concludes that extension of the regulated preferential electricity tariff is unlawful  alcoa will follow through with the appeal it filed before the court of first instance in luxembourg in november of in response to the investigation 
as previously reported  in november  in curtis v 
alcoa inc  civil action no 
cv ed tenn  a class action was filed by plaintiffs representing approximately  retired former employees of alcoa or reynolds and spouses and dependents of such retirees alleging violation of the employee retirement income security act erisa and the labor management relations act by requiring plaintiffs  beginning january   to pay health insurance premiums and increased co payments and co insurance for certain medical procedures and prescription drugs 
plaintiffs allege these changes to their retiree health care plans violate their rights to vested health care benefits 
plaintiffs additionally allege that alcoa has breached its fiduciary duty to plaintiffs under erisa by misrepresenting to them that their health benefits would never change 
plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief  back payment of 
table of contents benefits and attorneys fees 
alcoa has consented to treatment of plaintiffs claims as a class action 
during the fourth quarter of  following briefing and argument  the court ordered consolidation of the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction with trial  certified a plaintiff class  bifurcated and stayed the plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty claims  struck the plaintiffs jury demand  but indicated it would use an advisory jury  and initially set a trial date of september  in august  the court set a new trial date of march  and in january moved it to september  alcoa estimates that  in the event of an unfavorable outcome  the maximum exposure would be an additional post retirement benefit liability of approximately million and approximately million of expense includes an interest cost component annually  on average  for the next years 
alcoa believes that it has valid defenses and intends to defend this matter vigorously 
however  at this stage of the proceeding  the company is unable to reasonably predict the outcome 
as previously reported  on january   the ec announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules 
alcoa has been operating in spain for more than years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in  an equivalent tariff having been granted in the investigation is limited to the year and it is focused both on the energy intensive consumers and the distribution companies 
the investigation provided days to any interested party to submit observations and comments to the ec 
with respect to the energy intensive consumers  the ec is opening the investigation on the assumption that prices paid under the tariff in were lower than the pool price mechanism  therefore being  in principle  artificially below market conditions 
alcoa has submitted comments in which the company has provided evidence that prices paid by energy intensive consumers were in line with the market  in addition to various legal arguments defending the legality of the spanish tariff system 
therefore  it is alcoa s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations  and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system 
while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed for the year  it is possible that the ec could extend its investigation to later years 
alcoa believes that the total potential impact from an unfavorable decision would be approximately million  or million  pre tax for if the ec s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful  alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts

aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange lme and priced daily based on market supply and demand 
aluminum and alumina represent more than three fourths of alcoa s revenues  and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa 
nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners 
alcoa s products are used worldwide in aircraft  automobiles  commercial transportation  packaging  building and construction  oil and gas  defense  and industrial applications 
alcoa is a global company operating in countries 
based upon the country where the point of sale occurred  north america and europe generated and  respectively  of alcoa s sales 
in addition  alcoa has investments and activities in australia  brazil  china  iceland  guinea  and russia  all of which present opportunities for substantial growth 
governmental policies and other economic factors  including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  affect the results of operations in these countries

table of contents in  the company was faced with numerous challenges  including significantly higher costs for raw materials  energy  and other input costs and the continued depreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real 
during the second half of  global economic markets began an unprecedented decline  which resulted in a historic drop in the lme cash price per metric ton 
in response to such extraordinary market conditions  management made the decision to reduce alcoa s aluminum and alumina production by kmt and  kmt  respectively 
management also initiated the following actions to secure cash and safeguard alcoa s liquidity halted all non critical capital expenditures  suspended the existing share repurchase program  added a new day revolving credit facility  initiated global headcount reductions  instituted a global salary and hiring freeze  and decided to sell the electrical and electronic solutions  global foil  and transportation products europe businesses and to close the lone remaining auto cast wheels facility 
additionally  alcoa agreed to exchange its stake in the sapa ab joint venture for orkla asa s stake in the elkem aluminium ans joint venture 
this transaction will provide alcoa with increased smelting capacity by gaining full control of two smelters with competitive hydropower contracts while divesting itself of a business that management determined to exit in while global demand for aluminum is expected to continue to decline in  the actions that were initiated near the end of will allow alcoa to emerge even stronger when the global economy recovers 
in  management will work toward the following goals conserve cash and preserve liquidity  complete the s o luis alumina refinery expansion and juruti bauxite mine development in brazil  and seek out and take advantage of unique opportunities that arise during the global economic downturn

in june  a major gas supplier to alcoa s western australia refining operations part of alcoa of australia suffered a pipeline rupture and fire  which resulted in a complete shutdown of the supplier s gas production operations at a certain hub and a declaration of force majeure by the supplier to all customers 
the disruption in gas supply caused an immediate reduction in alcoa s production capacity and required the purchase of alternative fuel at a much higher cost than the natural gas displaced resulting in a significant negative impact on operations 
as a result  shortly thereafter  alcoa of australia notified its own customers that it was declaring force majeure under its alumina supply contracts 
during the second half of  the supplier partially restored the gas supply to alcoa of australia full restoration is expected in the first half of 
in addition  insurance recoveries of were received in the second half of net of insurance benefits  alcoa s earnings impact of the disruption in gas supply was after tax and minority interest before tax and minority interest in the alumina segment was impacted by after tax before tax and the remaining impact of after tax before tax was reflected in corporate due to alcoa s captive insurance program 
alcoa of australia is part of alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac  which is owned by alcoa and owned by alumina limited 
also in june  alcoa temporarily idled half of the aluminum production three of six operating potlines or kmt at its rockdale smelter due to ongoing power supply issues with rockdale s onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues 
in september  alcoa announced it was temporarily idling the remaining three potlines  or kmt  as a result of the cumulative effect of operating only half of the smelter  well known issues regarding the cost and long term reliability of the power supply  and overall market conditions 
in  the earnings impact of the idled potlines was pretax 
alcoa is seeking damages and other relief from its power supplier through ongoing litigation 
additionally  in conjunction with the idling of all six potlines  alcoa recorded restructuring charges in of pretax mostly for the layoff of approximately employees see restructuring and other charges below for additional information 
late in  management made the decision to reduce alcoa s alumina and aluminum production in response to the significant economic downturn 
as a result of this decision  including the already completed production curtailment at the rockdale smelter  reductions of kmt  or  of annualized output of alcoa s global smelting system were implemented 
smelters located in the united states tennessee  indiana  and washington and canada will be partially or fully curtailed 
also  alumina production will be reduced accordingly by a total of  kmt across the global refining system  including a partial curtailment at the point comfort  tx refinery 
the alumina and aluminum production curtailments will be fully implemented by the end of the first quarter of sales sales for were  compared with sales of  in  a decline of  or 
the decrease was driven mainly by the absence of months of sales  from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment  the absence of sales from the soft alloy extrusion business  in  and volume declines for most downstream businesses  especially related to the automotive and commercial transportation markets in north america and europe 
these negative impacts were principally offset by significantly higher primary aluminum volumes  mostly as a result of sales related to the production of the iceland smelter for a full year  and favorable foreign currency movements  primarily due to a stronger euro and australian dollar 

table of contents sales for were  compared with sales of  in  an increase of or 
the increase was primarily due to higher realized prices for alumina and aluminum of and  respectively  an increase in primary aluminum volume  higher demand in the aerospace and packaging markets  and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro 
these positive contributions were mostly offset by the absence of seven months of sales associated with the soft alloy extrusion business 
cost of goods sold cogs as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the increase in the percentage was mainly the result of continued cost increases in raw materials  energy  and other inputs  unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a significantly weaker us dollar  the production at the iceland smelter that did not occur in  and the impacts of the gas outage in western australia and the smelter curtailment at rockdale 
these items were primarily offset by the absence of the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment for months  the absence of the soft alloy extrusion business in  productivity improvements in most of the businesses within the engineered products and solutions segment  and the absence of certain costs incurred in as a result of production curtailments associated with the tennessee and rockdale smelters and startup costs at the iceland smelter  among others 
cogs as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the percentage increase was negatively impacted by significant increases in energy  raw materials  and other input costs  as a result of global inflation  and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar 
other items that contributed to the higher percentage include smelter curtailment costs associated with the power outage in tennessee and the shutdown of one of the potlines in rockdale  repair costs at the jamaica refinery due to the damage caused by hurricane dean  startup costs at the iceland smelter  costs associated with the national labor strike in guinea  restart costs for one of intalco s smelter lines  and the absence of a favorable legal settlement related to a former reynolds distribution business 
all of these items were partially offset by the absence of the soft alloy extrusion business  the increase in sales  a decrease in the charge recorded for lifo inventory reserves  and the absence of labor contract and strike preparation costs that occurred in selling  general administrative  and other expenses sg a expenses were  or of sales  in compared with  or of sales  in expenses decreased by mostly due to the absence of months of expenses from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment  the absence of transaction costs related to the offer for alcan inc  and the absence of expenses from the soft alloy extrusion business in

partially offsetting these increases was the absence of seven months of expenses related to the soft alloy extrusion business 
research and development expenses r d expenses were in compared with in and in the increase in as compared to was driven mainly by expenditures related to various projects for the businesses within the flat rolled products segment and the primary metals segment  partially offset by the absence of months of expenditures from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to expenditures related to various projects for the businesses within the flat rolled products segment and the primary metals segment 
provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization the provision for dd a was  in compared with  in the decline of  or  was principally the result of the absence of nine months of depreciation from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment in and the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of refining and smelting locations and various rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review of estimated useful lives completed during 
offsetting these 
table of contents reductions was a significant increase in depreciation expense related to the iceland smelter and norway anode facility being in service for a full year and unfavorable foreign currency movements as a result of a weaker us dollar 
the provision for dd a was  in compared with  in the decrease of  or  was primarily due to the cessation of depreciation beginning in november related to the soft alloy extrusion business and beginning in october associated with the businesses in the packaging and consumer segment  all of which was the result of the classification of these businesses as held for sale 
these decreases were mostly offset by an increase in depreciation related to placing growth projects into service  such as the pinjarra  australia refinery expansion and the jamaica early works program that were both placed in service during  and the start up of operations related to the iceland smelter and the mosj en anode facility during restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges for each of the three years in the period ended december  were comprised of the following asset impairments layoff costs other exit costs reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs restructuring and other charges reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs resulted from changes in facts and circumstances that led to changes in estimated costs 
employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated  benefits to be paid under existing severance plans  union contracts or statutory requirements  and the expected timetable for completion of the plans 
restructuring program late in  alcoa took specific actions to reduce costs and strengthen its portfolio  partly due to the current economic downturn 
such actions include targeted reductions  curtailments  and plant closures and consolidations  which will reduce headcount by approximately  by the end of  resulting in severance charges of after tax and minority interests  asset impairments of after tax and minority interests  and other exit costs of after tax 
the significant components of these actions were as follows as a result of recent market conditions  the primary metals segment will reduce production by kmt and the alumina segment will reduce production by a total of  kmt  all of which will be fully implemented by the end of the first quarter of these production curtailments as well as targeted reductions will result in the elimination of approximately  positions totaling in severance costs 
asset impairments of related to these two segments were also recognized  including the write off of in engineering costs related to a  kmt planned expansion of jamalco s clarendon  jamaica refinery 
the flat rolled products segment was restructured through the following actions restructuring and downsizing of the mill products businesses in europe and north america  resulting in severance charges of for the reduction of approximately positions  optimization of the global hard alloy extrusion operations  resulting in severance charges of for a headcount reduction of approximately and asset impairments of  alignment of production with demand at operations in russia  through the elimination of approximately  positions resulting in severance charges of  the shutdown of the foil business in bohai  resulting in severance charges of for the reduction of approximately positions  asset impairments of  and other exits costs of  primarily related to lease termination costs

asset impairments of after tax and after tax were recognized to reflect the estimated fair values of the global foil and transportation products europe businesses  respectively 
also  alcoa and orkla agreed to exchange their stakes in the sapa ab and elkem aluminium ans joint ventures 
this portfolio action resulted in an impairment charge of after tax to reflect the estimated fair value of alcoa s investment in sapa ab 
earlier in  alcoa recorded after tax in charges  which consists of after tax for the layoff of approximately employees and related curtailment of postretirement benefits and after tax for other exit costs  associated with the complete production curtailment of the rockdale  tx smelter kmt due to ongoing power supply issues with rockdale s onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues 
also during  alcoa recorded a loss of after tax on the sale of its packaging and consumer businesses 
the remaining net charges in were comprised of after tax and minority interests for severance related to a reduction in headcount of approximately  for other exit costs after tax  and after tax and minority interests for reversals of previously recorded costs  slightly more than half of which related to the reversal of a reserve related to a shutdown facility 
as of december   approximately  of the  employees were terminated 
cash payments of were made against the program reserves in as a result of the implementation of this restructuring plan  alcoa expects to eliminate approximately pretax on an annual basis from its cost base once the program has been completed 
restructuring program in  alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of after tax and minority interests  which were comprised of the following components after tax in asset impairments associated with a strategic review of certain businesses  a after tax reduction to the original impairment charge recorded in related to the estimated fair value of the soft alloy extrusion business  which was contributed to a joint venture effective june  see the restructuring program for additional information  and after tax and minority interests in net charges comprised of severance charges of after tax and minority interests related to the elimination of approximately positions and asset impairments of after tax of various other businesses and facilities  other exit costs of after tax and minority interests  primarily for accelerated depreciation associated with the shutdown of certain facilities in related to the restructuring program  and reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs of after tax and minority interests due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances 
in april  alcoa announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for the potential disposition of the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment and the automotive castings business 
in september  management completed its review of strategic alternatives and determined that the best course of action was to sell the packaging 
table of contents and consumer and automotive castings businesses 
as a result of this decision  the assets and related liabilities of the packaging and consumer and automotive castings businesses were classified as held for sale 
in the third quarter of  alcoa recorded impairment charges of after tax related to the packaging and consumer businesses and after tax for the automotive castings business to reflect the write down of the carrying value of the assets of these businesses to their respective estimated fair values 
in addition  alcoa recorded a discrete income tax charge related to goodwill associated with the planned sale of the packaging and consumer businesses that would have been non deductible for tax purposes under the transaction structure contemplated at the time 
in november  alcoa completed the sale of the automotive castings business and recognized a loss of after tax in restructuring and other charges on the statement of consolidated operations 
in december  alcoa agreed to sell the packaging and consumer businesses for  in cash  and reduced the impairment charge by after tax and the discrete income tax charge by as a result of the structure of the agreed upon sale this sale was completed in 
as of december   the terminations associated with the restructuring program were essentially complete 
cash payments of and were made against the program reserves in and  respectively 
restructuring program in november  alcoa executed a plan to re position several of its downstream operations in order to further improve returns and profitability  and to enhance productivity and efficiencies through a targeted restructuring of operations  and the creation of a soft alloy extrusion joint venture 
the restructuring program encompassed identifying assets to be disposed of  plant closings and consolidations  that led to the elimination of approximately  positions across the company s global businesses 
restructuring charges of after tax and minority interests were recorded in and were comprised of the following components of charges for employee termination and severance costs spread globally across the company  related to asset impairments for structures  machinery  equipment  and goodwill  more than half of which relates to the soft alloy extrusion business  and for other exit costs  consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation associated with assets for which the useful life has been changed due to plans to close certain facilities in the near term and environmental clean up costs 
partially offsetting these charges was of income related to the reversal of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs resulting from new facts and circumstances that arose subsequent to the original estimates 
the significant components of the restructuring program were as follows the hard and soft alloy extrusion businesses  included within the former extruded and end products segment  were restructured through the following actions alcoa signed a letter of intent with orkla asa s sapa group sapa to create a joint venture that would combine its soft alloy extrusion business with sapa s profiles extruded aluminum business 
effective june   the joint venture was completed 
the new venture is majority owned by orkla asa and operated by sapa 
in  alcoa recorded an impairment charge of to reduce the carrying value of the soft alloy extrusion business assets to their estimated fair value 
in conjunction with the contribution of the soft alloy extrusion business to the joint venture  alcoa recorded a after tax reduction to the original impairment charge recorded in consolidation of selected operations within the global hard alloy extrusion production operations serving the aerospace  automotive and industrial products markets  resulting in charges of for severance costs associated with the elimination of approximately positions  primarily in the us and europe 
operations within the flat rolled products segment were affected by the following actions restructuring of the can sheet operations resulting in the elimination of approximately positions  including the closure of the swansea facility in the uk in the first quarter of  resulting in charges of  comprised of for severance costs and for other exit costs  including accelerated depreciation 
conversion of the temporarily idled san antonio  tx rolling mill into a temporary research and development facility serving alcoa s global flat rolled products business  resulting in a asset impairment charge as these assets have no alternative future uses 

table of contents charges for asset impairments of related to a global flat rolled product asset portfolio review and rationalization 
reduction within the primary metals and alumina segments operations by approximately positions to further strengthen the company s position on the global cost curve 
this action resulted in charges of  consisting of for asset impairments  for severance costs and for other exit costs 
consolidation of selected operations within the packaging and consumer segment  resulting in the elimination of approximately positions and charges of  consisting of related to severance costs and for other exit costs  consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation 
restructuring at various other locations accounted for the remaining charges of  more than half of which are for severance costs related to approximately layoffs and the remainder for asset impairments and other exit costs 
as of december   the terminations associated with the restructuring program were essentially complete 
cash payments of and were made against the program reserves in and  respectively 
alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the segment results 
the pretax impact of allocating restructuring and other charges to the segment results would have been as follows alumina primary metals flat rolled products engineered products and solutions packaging and consumer segment total corporate total restructuring and other charges interest expense interest expense was in compared with in  resulting in an increase of  or 
the increase was principally caused by a higher average debt level  mostly due to the issuance of  in new senior notes in july and significantly higher commercial paper levels  and a decrease in capitalized interest  primarily due to placing growth projects into service  such as the iceland smelter and the norway anode facility in these items were almost completely offset by the absence of credit facility commitment fees related to the offer for alcan inc and a lower weighted average effective interest rate  driven mainly by the decrease in libor rates 
interest expense was in compared with in  resulting in an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily due to the amortization of in commitment fees paid and capitalized in june and an expense of for additional commitment fees paid in july  both of which were paid to secure an month  senior unsecured credit facility associated with the offer for alcan inc  and a higher average debt level  partially offset by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized related to construction projects  including the iceland smelter  the juruti bauxite mine and s o lu s refinery expansion in brazil  and the mosj en anode facility 
other income  net other income  net was in compared with  in the decrease of  or  was mostly due to the absence of the  gain related to the sale of alcoa s investment in chalco 
other items impacting this decline were losses related to the cash surrender value of life insurance as a result of the deterioration of the investment markets  unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  the absence of dividend income from alcoa s former stake in chalco  and the absence of a non recurring foreign currency gain in russia  all of which was partially offset by mark to market gains on derivative contracts and income related to a negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment previously made to the buyer of a prior alcoa divestiture 

table of contents other income  net  was  in compared with in the increase of  was primarily due to the sale of alcoa s investment in chalco  which resulted in a gain of  net of transaction fees and other expenses  and a non recurring foreign currency gain in russia  slightly offset by a decrease in the amount of dividends received from chalco between periods  and the absence of interest related to a brazilian court settlement in income taxes alcoa s effective tax rate was in compared with the us federal statutory rate of and alcoa s effective tax rate of in the effective tax rate in differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to the following income tax charges for the asset impairments included in the restructuring program  due to a decrease in deferred tax assets of the iceland operations as a result of an applicable tax rate change  a net associated with the sale of the packaging and consumer businesses  mainly due to the allocation of sale proceeds to higher tax rate jurisdictions as opposed to the allocation previously contemplated  somewhat offset by changes in tax assumptions surrounding transaction costs and the finalization of the divestiture of certain foreign locations 
these charges were partially offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a discrete income tax benefit related to the filing of the us income tax return 
alcoa s effective tax rate was in compared with the us federal statutory rate of and alcoa s effective tax rate of in the effective tax rate in differs from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to lower taxes on foreign income  mostly offset by a discrete income tax charge of related to goodwill that is non deductible for tax purposes associated with the sale of the packaging and consumer businesses 
management anticipates that the effective tax rate in will be approximately 
however  changes in the current economic environment  currency fluctuations  and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate significantly 
minority interests minority interests share of income from continuing operations was in compared with in the decline of was mostly due to lower earnings at awac attributed primarily to significant cost increases for raw materials and energy  unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  and the impact of the gas outage in western australia 
minority interests share of income from continuing operations was in compared with in the decrease was principally due to lower earnings at awac driven mainly by unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar and a significant increase in energy costs 
loss income from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations was in compared with a loss of in and income of in the loss of in is all related to the ees business comprised of asset impairments of to reflect the estimated fair value of the business and a net operating loss of  which includes restructuring charges of for headcount reductions of approximately  and a charge of for obsolete inventory 
the loss of in consisted of a loss related to the ees business  including severance charges of for headcount reductions of approximately  as part of a strategic business review to restructure ees and impairment charges of for goodwill and for various fixed assets as the forecasted future earnings and cash flows of the ees business no longer supported the carrying values of such assets  an loss related to working capital and other adjustments associated with the sale of the home exteriors business  and net operating income of of other discontinued businesses

see note b to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
late in  alcoa reclassified its ees business to discontinued operations based on the decision to sell the business 
the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods presented were reclassified to reflect the ees business in discontinued operations 
the ees business designs and manufactures electrical and electronic systems  wire harnesses and components for the ground transportation industry worldwide 
in  the ees business generated sales of  
table of contents and had approximately  employees as of december  during  alcoa reclassified its home exteriors business to discontinued operations upon the signing of a definitive sale agreement with ply gem industries  inc the sale of the home exteriors business was completed in october also during  alcoa reclassified the hawesville  ky automotive casting facility to discontinued operations upon closure of the facility 
the results of the engineered products and solutions segment were reclassified to reflect the movement of ees  the home exteriors business  and the hawesville automotive casting facility into discontinued operations 
segment information in  management approved a realignment of alcoa s reportable segments to better reflect the core businesses in which alcoa operates and how it is managed 
this realignment consisted of eliminating the extruded and end products segment and realigning its component businesses as follows the building and construction systems business is reported in the engineered products and solutions segment  the hard alloy extrusions business and the russian extrusions business are reported in the flat rolled products segment  and the remaining segment components  consisting primarily of the equity investment income of alcoa s interest in the sapa ab joint venture  and the latin american extrusions business  are reported in corporate 
additionally  the russian forgings business was moved from the engineered products and solutions segment to the flat rolled products segment  where all russian operations are now reported 
prior period amounts were reclassified to reflect the new segment structure 
also  the engineered solutions segment was renamed the engineered products and solutions segment 
alcoa s operations consist of five worldwide segments alumina  primary metals  flat rolled products  engineered products and solutions  and packaging and consumer this segment no longer contains any operations as the businesses within this segment were divested during 
segment performance under alcoa s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors  however  the primary measure of performance is the after tax operating income atoi of each segment 
certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting  interest income and expense  minority interests  corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities  along with depreciation and amortization on corporate owned assets  restructuring and other charges  discontinued operations  and other items  including intersegment profit and other metal adjustments  differences between tax rates used in the segments and the corporate effective tax rate  and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency translation gains losses are excluded from segment atoi

the following discussion provides shipments  sales  and atoi data of each segment  and production data for the alumina and primary metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended december  alumina alumina production kmt third party alumina shipments kmt third party sales intersegment sales total sales atoi this segment consists of alcoa s worldwide alumina system  including the mining of bauxite  which is then refined into alumina 
alumina is sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is processed into industrial chemical products 
slightly more than half of alcoa s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide  while the remainder is used internally 

table of contents in  alumina production increased by kmt compared to three of alcoa s nine refineries achieved production records in with the largest increase occurring at the pinjarra australia refinery due to the continued positive effects of the efficiency upgrade expansion completed in late in  alcoa reduced production at its point comfort  tx refinery by kmt per year due to negative market conditions  however  production for the year slightly exceeded the refinery s production performance 
in  alumina production decreased by kmt compared to impacts from the national labor strike in guinea and hurricane dean weighed on production with and decreases at point comfort  tx and jamaica  respectively  offsetting a increase at pinjarra 
paranam suriname  s o lu s  wagerup australia  and pinjarra set production records in third party sales for the alumina segment rose in compared with  primarily related to favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger australian dollar and increases of and in third party shipments and realized prices  respectively 
third party sales for this segment decreased in compared with  principally due to a reduction in third party shipments more than offsetting an lme driven increase in realized prices 
intersegment sales for the alumina segment climbed in compared with and in compared with  mainly as a result of a and increase in volumes  respectively  and higher realized prices 
atoi for the alumina segment decreased in compared with  mostly due to significant cost increases for bauxite  caustic soda  fuel oil  and natural gas  unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  and the impact of the gas outage in western australia net of insurance benefits  all of which was partially offset by higher realized prices  productivity improvements  and a positive impact due to the curtailment of production at the point comfort refinery 
atoi for this segment declined in compared with  principally due to unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  significantly higher energy costs  and rising freight cost  all of which more than offset increases in realized prices 
in  alcoa will continue to focus on completing the expansion of the s o lu s refinery total additional alumina production of  kmt  alcoa s share is  kmt and the development of the juruti bauxite mine total additional  kmt of bauxite  alcoa s share is  kmt by the end of the first half 
also  in response to negative market conditions  alcoa plans to reduce production by another  kmt per year by the end of the first quarter  kmt including the previously mentioned curtailment at point comfort 
additionally  fuel oil costs are expected to decrease while realized prices may decline significantly based on the lme s current prices and short term outlook 
primary metals aluminum production kmt third party aluminum shipments kmt alcoa s average realized price per metric ton of aluminum third party sales intersegment sales total sales atoi this segment consists of alcoa s worldwide smelter system 
primary metals receives alumina  primarily from the alumina segment  and produces primary aluminum used by alcoa s fabricating businesses  as well as sold to external customers  aluminum traders  and commodity markets 
results from the sale of aluminum powder  scrap  and excess power are also included in this segment  as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts 
primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices 
the sale of primary aluminum represents more than of this segment s third party sales 
in  aluminum production increased by kmt  mostly due to the iceland smelter  as was its first full year of production  the intalco  wa smelter as a result of the restart of additional pots early in the year  and the tennessee smelter  all of which was slightly offset by a reduction at the rockdale  tx smelter due to alcoa s decision to curtail 
table of contents all production at this facility until competitive market conditions return kmt per year 
late in  alcoa started partial production curtailments at various smelters  including intalco and baie comeau  quebec  which will result in an additional decline of kmt per year 
in  aluminum production rose kmt due to the intalco smelter s completed restart of one potline in the second quarter of  the acquisition of the minority interests in the intalco smelter in june  and the iceland smelter s start up in the second quarter of third party sales for the primary metals segment climbed in compared with  mostly due to higher volumes  primarily the result of the sales related to the production from the iceland smelter  shipments made to the packaging and consumer businesses subsequent to their divestiture in  and shipments made in the first half of to the sapa ab joint venture shipments to alcoa s soft alloy extrusion business were included in intersegment sales in the first half of  somewhat offset by lower realized prices of 
third party sales for this segment increased in compared with  primarily due to an increase in realized prices of and improved volumes  mainly due to shipments made in to the sapa ab joint venture 
intersegment sales for the primary metals segment declined in compared with  mainly as a result of lower demand from alcoa s downstream businesses  the absence of months of shipments to the packaging and consumer businesses that occurred in  and the absence of shipments to the soft alloy extrusion business that occurred in intersegment sales decreased in compared with due to the absence of shipments to the soft alloy extrusion business that occurred in and production curtailments associated with the tennessee and rockdale smelters that occurred in atoi for the primary metals segment dropped in compared with principally related to higher alumina  carbon  and energy costs  increased spending on repairs and maintenance  outside services  and labor  lower realized prices  the impact of the curtailment of all production at rockdale  and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar 
these negative impacts were partially offset by the absence of costs incurred in associated with the following the start up of the iceland smelter  the smelter production curtailment of one of the potlines in rockdale  and the smelter curtailment associated with the power outage in tennessee 
atoi for this segment declined in compared with as unfavorable foreign currency movements related to a weaker us dollar  costs associated with the rockdale and tennessee smelter curtailments  continued increases in raw material  freight  and energy costs  and iceland smelter start up costs were partially offset by higher realized prices 
at december   alcoa had kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of  kmt 
in  idle capacity increased by kmt as compared to due to the complete production curtailment at rockdale kmt and partial curtailments of approximately kmt related to other smelters  all of which are the result of current negative market conditions 
at december   alcoa had kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of  kmt 
in  idle capacity decreased by kmt as compared to due to the completed restart of one of intalco s smelter lines 
base capacity increased by kmt in as compared to primarily due to the completion of the kmt iceland smelter 
in  alcoa will curtail production by an additional kmt kmt including the previously mentioned curtailments  which includes all smelting at the tennessee operations kmt  by the end of the first quarter 
also  input costs are expected to decrease while alcoa anticipates the realization of cost savings from recent procurement initiatives 
lastly  realized prices may decline significantly based on the lme s current prices and short term outlook 
flat rolled products third party aluminum shipments kmt third party sales intersegment sales total sales atoi 
table of contents this segment s principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate  sheet  foil  and hard alloy extrusions 
this segment includes rigid container sheet rcs  which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans 
seasonal increases in rcs sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year 
this segment also includes sheet and plate used in the transportation  building and construction  and distribution markets mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables  which is sold directly to customers and through distributors 
additionally  hard alloy extrusions products  which are also sold directly to customers and through distributors  serve the distribution  aerospace  automotive  and commercial transportation markets 
approximately one third of the third party sales in this segment consist of rcs  while the remaining two thirds of third party sales are derived from sheet and plate  foil used in industrial markets  and hard alloy extrusions 
while the customer base for flat rolled products is large  a significant amount of sales of rcs  sheet  and plate is to a relatively small number of customers 
third party sales for the flat rolled products segment decreased in compared with the decline was principally due to lower volumes across all businesses  mainly the result of weak end markets in north america and europe  partially offset by positive foreign currency movements  mostly due to a stronger euro  and a favorable pricing and product mix 
third party sales for this segment climbed in compared with the increase was primarily due to passing through material price increases  favorable product mix associated with aerospace  higher volumes in the aerospace and packaging markets  and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro 
these increases were somewhat offset by the absence of sales associated with the shutdown of the swansea  uk can sheet facility in the first quarter of  as well as lower volumes in the distribution  automotive and commercial transportation markets 
atoi for the flat rolled products segment fell in compared with  mainly the result of continued higher direct materials  energy  and other cost increases and lower volumes across all businesses  partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix 
atoi for this segment declined in compared with  primarily due to cost increases for direct materials and energy  higher ramp up costs at facilities in both russia and china  and the impact of distributor de stocking in the second half of  somewhat offset by favorable pricing and product mix  and higher volumes in the markets noted previously 
in  the weakness in most end markets is expected to continue resulting in declining volumes while lower input costs  such as direct materials and energy  are anticipated 
also  the global foil business will be divested 
engineered products and solutions third party aluminum shipments kmt third party sales atoi this segment includes titanium  aluminum  and super alloy investment castings  forgings and fasteners  aluminum wheels  integrated aluminum structural systems  and architectural extrusions used in the aerospace  automotive  building and construction  commercial transportation  and power generation markets 
these products are sold directly to customers and through distributors 
in  the ees business was classified as discontinued operations  therefore  all periods presented exclude the results of this business 
third party sales for the engineered products and solutions segment increased in compared with the improvement was primarily due to higher demand in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets  favorable pricing in the building and construction market  positive foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro  and the addition of two fastener businesses acquired early in  all of which was partially offset by significant volume declines in the commercial transportation market 
third party sales for this segment increased in compared with the improvement was principally due to aerospace and power generation increases and higher volumes and prices in the building and construction business more than offsetting the decline in commercial transportation 

table of contents atoi for the engineered products and solutions segment climbed in compared with  mainly due to continued strong demand and productivity improvements in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets  favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro  and the positive contribution of the acquired fastener businesses  all of which was somewhat offset by significantly lower volumes in the commercial transportation market 
atoi for this segment increased in compared with  largely due to continued strong demand and operational performance in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets  favorable prices and higher volumes in the building and construction business  and productivity improvements 
these positive impacts were partially offset by demand decline in the north america heavy truck market 
in  market conditions in the commercial transportation and building and construction markets are expected to further weaken 
however  it is anticipated that productivity initiatives will materialize to partially offset the market downturn 
also  the lone remaining cast auto wheels facility will be closed and the transportation products europe business will be divested 
packaging and consumer third party aluminum shipments kmt third party sales atoi the businesses within this segment were sold to rank group limited in  therefore  this segment no longer contains any operations 
prior to the sale of these businesses  this segment included consumer  foodservice  and flexible packaging products  food and beverage closures  and plastic sheet and film for the packaging industry 
the principal products in this segment included aluminum foil  plastic wraps and bags  plastic beverage and food closures  flexible packaging products  thermoformed plastic containers  and extruded plastic sheet and film 
consumer products were marketed under brands including reynolds wrap  diamond  baco  and cut rite 
seasonal increases generally occurred in the second and fourth quarters of the year for such products as consumer foil and plastic wraps and bags  while seasonal slowdowns for closures generally occurred in the fourth quarter of the year 
products were generally sold directly to customers  consisting of supermarkets  beverage companies  food processors  retail chains  and commercial foodservice distributors 
third party sales for the packaging and consumer segment increased in compared with  primarily due to higher volume and favorable pricing and mix across all businesses 
atoi for the packaging and consumer segment climbed in compared with  primarily due to productivity improvements across all businesses and the cessation of depreciation beginning in october  as the assets of this segment were classified as held for sale due to management s announced intent to actively pursue the sale of these businesses

environmental matters alcoa continues to participate in environmental assessments and cleanups at a number of locations 
these include owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties  previously owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties  and waste sites  including superfund sites 
a liability is recorded for environmental remediation when a cleanup program becomes probable and the costs or damages can be reasonably estimated 
as assessments and cleanups proceed  the liability is adjusted based on progress made in determining the extent of remedial actions and related costs and damages 
the liability can change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination  changes in remedial requirements  and technological changes 

table of contents the following discussion provides details regarding the current status of certain significant reserves related to current or former alcoa sites 
massena  ny alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the grasse river  adjacent to alcoa s massena plant site  under a order from the us environmental protection agency epa issued under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  also known as superfund 
sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 
alcoa submitted various analysis of alternatives reports to the epa starting in through that reported the results of river and sediment studies  potential alternatives for remedial actions related to the pcb contamination  and additional information requested by the epa 
in june  the epa requested that alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup 
the results of these additional studies  submitted in a report to the epa in april  suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios 
the epa informed alcoa that a final remedial decision for the river could not be made without substantially more information  including river pilot studies on the effects of ice formation and breakup on each of the remedial techniques 
alcoa submitted to the epa  and the epa approved  a remedial options pilot study rops to gather this information 
the scope of this study included sediment removal and capping  the installation of an ice control structure  and significant monitoring 
from through  alcoa completed the work outlined in the rops 
in november  alcoa submitted an updated analysis of alternatives report to the epa incorporating the new information obtained from the rops related to the feasibility and costs associated with various capping and dredging alternatives  including options for ice control 
as a result  alcoa increased the reserve associated with the grasse river by for the estimated costs of a proposed ice control remedy and for partial settlement of potential damages of natural resources 
this new information will be used by the epa to select a remedy for the entire river 
the epa s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability 
alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the epa s record of decision is issued  which is expected in or later 
sherwin  tx in connection with the sale of the sherwin alumina refinery  which was required to be divested as part of the reynolds merger in  alcoa agreed to retain responsibility for the remediation of the then existing environmental conditions  as well as a pro rata share of the final closure of the active waste disposal areas  which remain in use 
alcoa s share of the closure costs is proportional to the total period of operation of the active waste disposal areas 
alcoa estimated its liability for the active disposal areas by making certain assumptions about the period of operation  the amount of material placed in the area prior to closure  and the appropriate technology  engineering  and regulatory status applicable to final closure

louis  the owner of the site  entered into an administrative order with the epa in december to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study of an area used for the disposal of bauxite residue from historic alumina refining operations 
a draft feasibility study was submitted to the epa in april the feasibility study included remedial alternatives that ranged from no further action to significant grading  stabilization  and water management of the bauxite residue disposal areas 
as a result  alcoa increased the environmental reserve for this location by in the epa s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability 
alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the epa s record of decision is issued  which is expected late in or later 
vancouver  wa in  alcoa sold its vancouver smelter to a company that is now known as evergreen aluminum evergreen 
the purchase and sale agreement contained a provision that alcoa retain liability for any environmental issues that arise subsequent to the sale that pre date as a result of this obligation  alcoa recorded a reserve for the vancouver location at that time 
evergreen decommissioned the smelter and cleaned up its portion of 
table of contents the site under a consent order with the washington department of ecology wde 
in february  evergreen notified alcoa that it had identified numerous areas containing contamination that predated separately  in september  alcoa completed a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs under the washington state model toxics control act and negotiated a consent decree with wde  which requires alcoa to complete cleanup of pcb contaminated sediments in the columbia river as well as remediate soil contamination in upland portions of the vancouver property 
late in  alcoa started cleanup work on the columbia river and discovered additional contamination and waste materials along the shoreline area and in upland areas 
in addition  evergreen presented additional cost estimates for contaminated areas that were discovered since march as a result of all of the above items related to the former vancouver site  alcoa increased the environmental reserve by in as cleanup work progresses and final remedies are negotiated with wde  a subsequent reserve adjustment may be necessary 
based on the foregoing  it is possible that alcoa s financial position  liquidity  or results of operations  in a particular period  could be materially affected by matters relating to these sites 
however  based on facts currently available  management believes that adequate reserves have been provided and that the disposition of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial position  liquidity  or the results of operations of the company 
alcoa s remediation reserve balance was and at december  and december  of which and was classified as a current liability  respectively  and reflects the most probable costs to remediate identified environmental conditions for which costs can be reasonably estimated 
in  the remediation reserve was increased by  mostly due to the adjustments related to the grasse river and former vancouver property discussed above 
in  the remediation reserve was decreased by consisting of a adjustment for the liabilities associated with a previously owned smelter site and a adjustment for liabilities at the russian rolling mills and extrusion plants  both of which were partially offset by a net increase of in liabilities associated with various locations 
the and adjustments were made after further investigations were completed and alcoa was able to obtain additional information about the environmental condition and the associated liabilities related to these sites 
the changes to the remediation reserve were recorded in cost of goods sold on the statement of consolidated operations in both periods 
payments related to remediation expenses applied against the reserve were and in and  respectively 
these amounts include expenditures currently mandated  as well as those not required by any regulatory authority or third party 
included in annual operating expenses are the recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and environmental programs 
these costs are estimated to be approximately of cost of goods sold 
liquidity and capital resources alcoa takes a very disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet 
management faced the significant challenge of maintaining this approach while providing the company with the necessary liquidity to operate effectively  especially in the second half of in response to recent changes in the economic markets across the globe  management reacted quickly to solidify alcoa s liquidity position 
the following actions were initiated in the second half of to conserve cash and preserve liquidity greater scrutiny over the daily management of alcoa s cash position  higher risk tolerance on raw materials with lower minimum order quantities and lower carrying levels  targeted headcount reductions across the globe  a salary and hiring freeze at the corporate level  suspension of the existing share repurchase program  and the addition of a new day  revolving credit facility 
a number of changes were also made to alcoa s capital expenditures strategy as follows capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically  growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible  and all non critical capital expenditures were stopped 
capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain alcoa s compliance with the law  keep a facility operating  or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs 
the planned sale 
table of contents or shutdown of various businesses will also contribute positively to alcoa s liquidity position in along with the foregoing actions  cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover alcoa s current operational and business needs 
for a discussion of long term liquidity  see the disclosures included in contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
cash from operations cash from operations in was  compared with  in  resulting in a decrease of  or 
the decline of  was primarily due to a decrease in earnings after taking into account non cash income and expenses  a cash outflow associated with working capital  in higher pension contributions  and the absence of in cash received on a long term aluminum supply contract 
these cash outflows were slightly offset by a cash inflow related to noncurrent assets and liabilities and a increase in cash provided from discontinued operations 
the major components of the change in working capital are as follows a smaller decrease in receivables  primarily as a result of improved sales from most businesses not classified as held for sale  a increase in inventories  mostly due to higher costs of raw materials and other inputs  a smaller increase in accounts payable  trade  a decrease in accrued expenses  and a increase in taxes  including taxes on income 
cash from operations in was  compared with  in  resulting in an increase of  or 
the improvement of is principally related to a  positive change associated with working capital  primarily due to improvements in receivables  inventories  and accounts payable and accrued expenses  higher net income of  and a cash inflow of related to a long term aluminum supply contract 
these positive impacts were partially offset by a significant increase in non cash adjustments  mostly related to the sale of the chalco investment 
financing activities cash provided from financing activities was  in compared with cash used for financing activities of  in the change of  was primarily due to a  reduction in the repurchase of common stock  mainly the result of the temporary suspension of the share repurchase program  a  change in commercial paper  principally due to an increase in commercial paper issued and the absence of a  reduction of commercial paper with the proceeds from newly issued long term debt in january  and a decrease in payments on long term debt  mostly due to the purchase and repayment of notes due august  as compared to the repayment of in notes due march these cash inflows were somewhat offset by a decline in common stock issued for compensation plans  primarily due to fewer stock option exercises as result of the significant decline in the market price of alcoa s common stock 
cash used for financing activities was  in compared with in the change of  was primarily due to a  increase in the repurchase of common stock due to a significant increase in the number of shares repurchased as a result of the january and october authorized programs  a  change in the net change in commercial paper  mostly due to the repayment of commercial paper with the majority of the proceeds from the issuance of new long term debt in  an increase in payments on long term debt  primarily related to the january purchase of of outstanding notes due august and the repayment of the remaining of outstanding notes in august  in payments for debt issuance costs  including a commitment fee of paid to secure a credit facility related to the offer for alcan inc  and a increase in dividends paid to shareholders as a result of the eight cents per share annual increase approved in january partially offsetting these cash inflows was a  increase in additions to long term debt  principally due to proceeds received of  net of in original issue discounts from the issuance of new notes due  notes due  and notes due  a increase in common stock issued for stock compensation plans related to cash received for the exercise of stock options  and a increase in minority interest contributions  primarily from an increase in contributions received from alumina limited  related to their share of capital spending at the s o lu s and juruti facilities 
in october  alcoa entered into a five year revolving credit agreement  dated as of october  the credit agreement  with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein

additionally  if there is an amount outstanding under rcf on the last calendar day of any of the next three quarterly periods  alcoa will pay a duration fee to the lenders 
the duration fee is equal to of such outstanding amount on the respective day starting on december  and increases by each quarter thereafter 
loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty  subject to customary breakage costs 
rca also provides for a mandatory prepayment  not to exceed the amount outstanding under rcf at such time  equal to of the net proceeds alcoa receives from certain future debt or equity issuances in capital markets transactions or of the net proceeds alcoa receives from asset sales other than those in the ordinary course of business  if the proceeds from all asset sales exceed any prepayments made related to the net proceeds from assets sales or that would have been made if amounts were outstanding under rcf also reduce the lenders commitments by a corresponding amount

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments  estimates  and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes 
areas that require significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  environmental matters  asset retirement obligations  the testing of goodwill  equity investments  and properties  plants  and equipment for impairment  estimated proceeds on businesses to be divested  pension plans and other postretirement benefits  stock based compensation  and income taxes 

table of contents management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments  estimates  and assumptions  and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
a discussion of the judgments  estimates  assumptions  and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and environmental matters can be found in the market risks and derivative activities and the environmental matters sections  respectively 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
asset retirement obligations 
alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa s bauxite mining  alumina refining  and aluminum smelting facilities 
these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal  closure of bauxite residue areas  mine reclamation  and landfill closure 
alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation  if required by a lease agreement  and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities 
the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis  at the time the obligation is incurred  and accreted over time for the change in present value 
additionally  alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 
certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries  aluminum smelters  and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date 
a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa s control 
such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures  maintenance and upgrade programs  and other factors 
at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made  alcoa would record a retirement obligation for the removal  treatment  transportation  storage and or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos  underground and aboveground storage tanks  pcbs  various process residuals  solid wastes  electronic equipment waste and various other materials 
such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded 
if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately  the estimated caro as of december  ranges from less than to per structure structures in today s dollars 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  or slower growth rates  among others 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
alcoa has reporting units  of which three are included in the flat rolled products segment and five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment 
the remaining two reporting units are the alumina and primary metals segments 
almost of alcoa s total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs  and alcoa power and propulsion app  businesses  both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment  and primary metals 
these amounts include an allocation of corporate goodwill 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
alcoa uses a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its 
table of contents reporting units when testing for impairment 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  tax rates  capital spending  discount rate  and working capital changes 
most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units 
cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years cash flows and historical relationships in later years 
the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units weighted average cost of capital wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 
in  the estimated fair value of nine of the ten reporting units  including afs and app  were well in excess of the carrying value of these businesses resulting in no impairment 
for primary metals  while the estimated fair value of this business exceeded its carrying value  the excess was significantly impacted due to the historic drop in the lme price that occurred in the second half of management performed an updated goodwill impairment test for primary metals in late december  which again resulted in no impairment the tests for the other nine reporting units were also updated 
historically  lme pricing levels and the corresponding input costs eg  raw materials  energy have generally trended in the same manner  resulting in relatively consistent cash margins over time 
as a result  the estimated fair value of primary metals traditionally has been well in excess of its carrying value 
however  during the second half of  the lme price decreased at an unprecedented rate  significantly outpacing any decreases in associated input costs 
as a result of this near term disruption in the historical relationship between lme and input costs  the expected cash margins in the early years in the dcf model were lower than normal and lower than long term expectations 
in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value  additional analysis would be required 
the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill  which may involve the use of valuation experts 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized  which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity 
with alcoa s common stock price at extraordinary lows late in  management analyzed the valuations derived from the dcf models in relation to alcoa s market capitalization 
in management s judgment  a significant portion of the recent decline in alcoa s stock price is related to the current unprecedented liquidity crisis in the overall economy and is not reflective of the underlying cash flows of the reporting units 
as a result  management believes the company s forecasted cash flows constitute a better indicator of the current fair value of alcoa s reporting units than the current pricing of its common shares 
the sum of the individual estimated fair values of alcoa s reporting units per the dcf models is greater than the market value of alcoa s common stock 
however  fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
equity investments 
alcoa invests in a number of privately held companies  primarily through joint ventures and consortiums 
these investments are accounted for on the equity method and include the company s investment in shining prospect pte 
ltd 
the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investee 
management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable 
this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired 
the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant  sustained declines in an investee s revenue  earnings  and cash flow trends  adverse market conditions of the investee s industry or geographic area  the investee s ability to continue operations measured by several items including liquidity  and other factors 
once an impairment indicator is identified  management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary  in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value 
an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 

table of contents properties  plants  and equipment 
properties  plants  and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value  with fair value determined using the best information available  which generally is a dcf model 
discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model  valuations performed by third parties  earnings multiples  or indicative bids  when available 
a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques  including the forecasting of markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs and expenses  and multiple other factors 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made  however  the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of the businesses to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
liabilities and expenses for pension plans and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets  and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  medical costs  retirement age  and mortality 
the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan 
the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of of is approximately and either a charge or credit of to after tax earnings in the following year 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five year average market value of assets 
a change in the assumption for the long term rate of return on plan assets of of would impact after tax earnings by approximately for although the year moving average of actual performance fell below for the first time in years  the year moving average has continued to exceed 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be reduced to for reflecting recent market conditions 
in  a net charge of   after tax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of plan assets  which was somewhat offset by the decrease in the accumulated benefit obligation as a result of a basis point increase in the discount rate and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs 
additionally  a charge of was recorded in other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy 
in  a net credit of after tax was recorded in other comprehensive income due to a net decrease in the accumulated benefit obligations as a result of a basis point increase in the discount rate  which was partially offset by plan amendments and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs 
additionally  a credit of was recorded in other comprehensive income due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy 
stock based compensation 
alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non substantive vesting period approach  in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of each new stock option is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice pricing model 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility  annual forfeiture rate  and exercise behavior 
if any of these assumptions differ significantly from actual  stock based compensation expense could be impacted 
as part of alcoa s stock based compensation plan design  individuals who are retirement eligible have a six month requisite service period in the year of grant 
equity grants are issued in january each year 
as a result  a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first and second quarters of each year for these retirement eligible employees 
compensation expense recorded in   and was after tax  after tax  and 
table of contents after tax  respectively 
of this amount    and in   and  respectively  pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement eligible employees 
on december   alcoa accelerated the vesting of million unvested stock options granted to employees in and on january  the and accelerated options had weighted average exercise prices of and  respectively  and in the aggregate represented approximately of alcoa s total outstanding options 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of the and options was made primarily to avoid recognizing the related compensation expense in future consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of a new accounting standard 
the accelerated vesting of the and stock options reduced alcoa s after tax stock option compensation expense in and by and  respectively 
beginning in  plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options  stock awards  or a combination of both 
this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid  and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances 
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold 
otherwise  these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled  which means that the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open  or the statute of limitation expires 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized 
alcoa also has unamortized tax deductible goodwill of resulting from intercompany stock sales and reorganizations generally at a to rate 
alcoa recognizes the tax benefits associated with this tax deductible goodwill as it is being amortized for local income tax purposes rather than in the period in which the transaction is consummated 
related party transactions alcoa buys products from and sells products to various related companies  consisting of entities in which alcoa retains a or less equity interest  at negotiated arms length prices between the two parties 
these transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of alcoa for all periods presented

sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions 
the adoption of sfas  as it relates to financial assets  had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
management has determined that the adoption of sfas  as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
sfas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
this standard is now the single source in gaap for the definition of fair value  except for the fair value of leased property as defined in sfas sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under sfas are described below level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg  interest rates  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means 
level inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
the following sections describe the valuation methodologies used by alcoa to measure different financial instruments at fair value  including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified 
where appropriate the description includes details of the valuation models  the key inputs to those models  and any significant assumptions 
available for sale securities 
alcoa uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of available for sale securities 
these financial instruments consist of exchange traded fixed income and equity securities  and are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
derivative contracts 
derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices and significant other observable and unobservable inputs 
such financial instruments consist of aluminum  interest rate  commodity principally energy related  and foreign currency contracts 
the fair values for the majority of these derivative contracts are based upon current quoted market prices 
these financial instruments are typically exchange traded and are generally classified within level or level of the fair value hierarchy depending on whether the exchange is deemed to be an active market or not 

table of contents for certain derivative contracts whose fair values are based upon trades in liquid markets  such as aluminum options  valuation model inputs can generally be verified and valuation techniques do not involve significant management judgment 
the fair values of such financial instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
alcoa has other derivative contracts that do not have observable market quotes 
for these financial instruments  management uses significant other observable inputs ie  information concerning time premiums and volatilities for certain option type embedded derivatives and regional premiums for swaps 
for periods beyond the term of quoted market prices for aluminum  alcoa uses a macroeconomic model that estimates the long term price of aluminum based on anticipated changes in worldwide supply and demand 
where appropriate  valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity  bid offer spreads  and credit considerations 
such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence level 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used level 
the following table presents alcoa s assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as of december  level level level collateral total assets available for sale securities derivative contracts total assets liabilities derivative contracts these amounts represent cash collateral paid and held that alcoa elected to net against the fair value amounts recognized for certain derivative instruments executed with the same counterparties under master netting arrangements 
this election was made under the provisions of fsp fin  which was adopted by alcoa on january  see below 
the collateral paid of relates to derivative contracts for aluminum included in level and the collateral held of relates to derivative contracts for interest rates included in level financial instruments classified as level in the fair value hierarchy represent derivative contracts in which management has used at least one significant unobservable input in the valuation model 
the following table presents a reconciliation of activity for such derivative contracts on a net basis year ended december  balance at beginning of period total realized unrealized losses or gains included in sales cost of goods sold other comprehensive loss purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements transfers in and or out of level balance at end of period total losses or gains included in earnings attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to derivative contracts still held at december  sales cost of goods sold 
table of contents as reflected in the table above  the net unrealized loss on derivative contracts using level valuation techniques was as of december  this loss is mainly attributed to embedded derivatives in a power contract that index the price of power to the lme price of aluminum 
these embedded derivatives are primarily valued using observable market prices 
however  due to the length of the contract  the valuation model also requires management to estimate the long term price of aluminum based upon anticipated changes in worldwide supply and demand 
the embedded derivatives have been designated as hedges of forward sales of aluminum and their realized gains and losses are included in sales on the statement of consolidated operations 
also  included within level measurements are derivative financial instruments that hedge the cost of electricity 
transactions involving on peak power are observable as there is an active market 
however  due to alcoa s power consumption  there are certain off peak times when there is not an actively traded market for electricity 
therefore  management utilizes various forecast services  historical relationships  and near term market actual pricing to determine the fair value 
gains and losses realized for the electricity contracts are included in cost of goods sold on the statement of consolidated operations 
additionally  an embedded derivative in a power contract that indexes the difference between the long term debt ratings of alcoa and the counterparty from any of the three major credit rating agencies is included in level management uses forecast services  historical relationships  and market prices to determine fair value 
none of the level positions on hand at december  resulted in any unrealized gains in the statement of consolidated operations

as a result  management elected to net cash collateral against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty when a master netting arrangement exists 
the provisions of fsp fin are to be applied retroactively for all financial statement periods presented

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements  uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
this interpretation requires that a company recognize in its financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
effective january   alcoa adopted fsp no 
fin  definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
 fsp fin  which was issued on may  fsp fin amends fin to provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
the term effectively settled replaces the term ultimately settled when used to describe recognition  and the terms settlement or settled replace the terms ultimate settlement or ultimately settled when used to describe measurement of a tax position under fin fsp fin clarifies that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished 
for tax positions considered effectively settled  an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit  even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open 
the adoption of fin and fsp fin did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements

certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components  and  as a result  actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table 
operating leases represent multi year obligations for certain computer equipment  plant equipment  vehicles  and buildings 
interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of december  and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to the effect of outstanding interest rate swaps  which are accounted for as fair value hedges  are included in interest related to total debt 
as of december   these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on  of debt through as the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable  actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table

while these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments  they represent contractual obligations for which the company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made 
the longest such contract expires in uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities 
the amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of december  the total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the thereafter column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments 
if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires  then additional payments will not be necessary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in its operations  alcoa is exposed to financial  market  political  and economic risks 
the following discussion provides information regarding alcoa s exposure to the risks of changing commodity prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates 
alcoa s commodity and derivative activities are subject to the management  direction  and control of the strategic risk management committee srmc 
the srmc is composed of the chief executive officer  the chief financial officer  and other officers and employees that the chief executive officer selects 
the srmc reports to the board of directors on the scope of its activities 
the interest rate  foreign currency  aluminum  and other commodity contracts are held for purposes other than trading 
they are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility  and to cover underlying exposures 
the company is not involved in trading activities for energy  weather derivatives  or other nonexchange commodities 
commodity price risks alcoa is a leading global producer of primary aluminum and aluminum fabricated products 
as a condition of sale  customers often require alcoa to enter into long term  fixed price commitments 
these commitments expose alcoa to the risk of higher aluminum prices between the time the order is committed and the time that the order is shipped 
alcoa uses futures contracts  totaling kmt at december   to reduce the aluminum price risk associated with a portion of these fixed price firm commitments 
the effects of this hedging activity will be recognized in earnings over the designated hedge periods in to alcoa also sells aluminum products to third parties at then current market prices and is exposed to the risk of lower market prices at the time of shipment 
alcoa has also entered into futures contracts  totaling kmt at december   to hedge a portion of future production 
the effects of this hedging activity will be recognized in earnings over the designated hedge periods in to alcoa has also entered into futures contracts to minimize its price risk related to other customer sales and pricing arrangements 
alcoa has not qualified these contracts for hedge accounting treatment  and therefore  the fair value gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in earnings 
these contracts totaled kmt at december  in 
table of contents addition  alcoa has power supply and other contracts that contain pricing provisions related to the lme aluminum price 
the lme linked pricing features are considered embedded derivatives 
a majority of these embedded derivatives have been designated as hedges of future sales of aluminum 
gains and losses on the remainder of these embedded derivatives are recognized in earnings 
the net mark to market pretax earnings impact from aluminum derivative and hedging activities was a gain of in alcoa purchases certain energy commodities to meet its production requirements and believes it is highly likely that such purchases will continue in the future 
these purchases expose the company to the risk of higher prices 
to hedge a portion of these risks  alcoa uses futures and forward contracts 
the effects of this hedging activity will be recognized in earnings over the designated hedge periods in to financial risk interest rates alcoa uses interest rate swaps to help maintain a strategic balance between fixed and floating rate debt and to manage overall financing costs 
for a portion of its fixed rate debt  the company has entered into pay floating  receive fixed interest rate swaps to effectively change the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates 
alcoa is also subject to an exposure in the differential between its long term debt rating and the long term debt rating of its counterparty in a long term power contract  which begins in and expires in currencies alcoa is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange contracts may be used from time to time to hedge the variability in cash flows from the forecasted payment or receipt of currencies other than the functional currency 
these contracts cover periods consistent with known or expected exposures through fair values and sensitivity analysis the following table shows the fair values of outstanding derivative contracts at december  and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical change increase or decrease of in the market prices or rates that existed at december  fair value loss gain index change of aluminum interest rates other commodities  principally energy related aluminum reflects of cash collateral paid that alcoa elected to net against the fair value amounts recognized for certain derivative instruments executed with the same counterparties under master netting arrangements 
interest rates reflect of cash collateral held that alcoa elected to net against the fair value amounts recognized for certain derivative instruments executed with the same counterparties under master netting arrangements 
these elections were made under the provisions of fsp fin  which was adopted by alcoa on january  see recently adopted accounting standards 
aluminum consists primarily of losses on hedge contracts  embedded derivatives in power contracts in iceland and brazil  and alcoa s share of gains and losses on hedge contracts of norwegian smelters that are accounted for under the equity method 
material limitations the disclosures with respect to commodity prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange risk do not take into account the underlying commitments or anticipated transactions 
if the underlying items were included in the analysis  the gains or losses on the futures contracts would be offset 
actual results will be determined by a number of factors that are not under alcoa s control and could vary significantly from those factors disclosed 

table of contents alcoa is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments  as well as credit or performance risk with respect to its hedged customers commitments 
although nonperformance is possible  alcoa does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these parties 
contracts are with creditworthy counterparties and are further supported by cash  treasury bills  or irrevocable letters of credit issued by carefully chosen banks 
in addition  various master netting arrangements are in place with counterparties to facilitate settlement of gains and losses on these contracts
