item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading supplier of heavy construction materials in the united states through our three business segments cement  aggregates and consumer products 
our principal products are gray portland cement  produced and sold through our cement segment  stone  sand and gravel  produced and sold through our aggregates segment  and ready mix concrete  produced and sold through our consumer products segment 
other products include expanded shale and clay lightweight aggregates  produced and sold through our aggregates segment  and packaged concrete mix  mortar  sand and related products  produced and sold through our consumer products segment 
our facilities are concentrated primarily in texas  louisiana and california 
in may  we completed construction on a project to expand and modernize our oro grande  california cement plant at a total project cost of approximately million  excluding capitalized interest related to the project 
we constructed approximately million tons of advanced dry process annual cement production capacity  and retired the million tons of existing  but less efficient  production 
in october  we commenced construction on a project to expand our hunter  texas cement plant 
we are expanding the hunter plant by approximately million tons of advanced dry process annual cement production capacity 
the  tons of existing production will remain in operation 
in light of current economic and market conditions  we believe it is likely that current cement demand levels in texas will not permit the new kiln to operate profitably if the project is completed as originally scheduled 
as a result  we have delayed completion of the project 
we expect cement demand to rebound in the future and we will resume construction when future economic and market conditions indicate it is appropriate 
we anticipate beginning the commissioning of the project within months of resuming construction 
the pause in construction began in may  at which time we had incurred approximately million  excluding capitalized interest of approximately million related to the project  of which million had been expended 
we believe the delay conserved million to million of cash expenditures in fiscal years and until we determine the date that we will resume construction  we cannot accurately estimate the cost of completing the project 
we own long term reserves of the primary raw materials for the production of cement and aggregates 
our business requires large amounts of capital investment  energy  labor and maintenance 
during the last year  the economy in all of our operating regions has been in recession 
declining home values  investor losses on mortgage related securities  tight credit conditions  state budget shortfalls and rising unemployment have led to declines in all segments of construction activity in our markets 
these conditions have impacted all segments of our business 
in response  we have taken numerous steps to manage our production to more closely match market demand  reduce costs and manage our cash position 
in addition to the delay in construction of the expansion of our hunter plant discussed above  we have significantly reduced spending 
we have idled plants where necessary and reduced our employee force accordingly 
since the beginning of the recession in december  we have reduced our employee and contract labor force by approximately 
we have also significantly reduced overtime pay  implemented a salary freeze for non union employees and renegotiated a number of supply and service agreements 
our president and chief executive officer voluntarily reduced his salary by and other executive officers similarly reduced their salaries by 
we have negotiated amendments to our senior revolving credit facility to reduce the risk that the market decline would cause our operating results to fall below levels required by financial covenants 
these steps and others are indicative of our intense focus on cost reduction  management of our cash position and management of production levels  which we believe had a significant positive impact on our operating results in fiscal year 
table of contents results of operations management uses segment operating profit as its principal measure to assess performance and to allocate resources 
business segment operating profit consists of net sales less operating costs and expenses that are directly attributable to the segment 
unallocated overhead and other income includes income and operating overhead expenses such as environmental  engineering and other administrative activities that directly relate to some or all of our segments and are not allocated 
corporate includes non operating income and expenses related to administrative  financial  legal  human resources and real estate activities 
prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
it has been our past practice not to value our natural aggregate inventories for a number of reasons  including the fact that they were immaterial to our financial position and results of operations 
a current assessment of this accounting method identified that our inventory levels have increased and their value has become significant in relation to the overall inventory amounts presented on our balance sheets in light of current economic conditions and the spin off of chaparral steel company in we have adopted the average cost method of valuing our natural aggregate inventories 
under the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
 materiality and staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements we have determined that the adjustments are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements for and however  because the cumulative effect would have been material to our consolidated financial statements we have adjusted all prior period financial information to reflect this change 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in the facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect management s more complex judgments and estimates 
receivables 
management evaluates the ability to collect accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
a reserve for doubtful accounts is maintained based on the length of time receivables are past due or the status of a customer s financial condition 
if we are aware of a specific customer s inability to make required payments  specific amounts are added to the reserve 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal  state and local authorities  and make provision for the estimated costs related to compliance when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
legal contingencies 
we are defendants in lawsuits which arose in the normal course of business  and make provision for the estimated loss from any claim or legal proceeding when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we used the last in  first out lifo method to value finished products  work in process and raw material inventories excluding natural aggregate inventories 
natural aggregate inventories and parts and supplies inventories are valued using the average cost method 
our natural aggregate inventory excludes volumes in excess of an average twelve month period of actual sales 
long lived assets 
management reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and would record an impairment charge if necessary 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
goodwill 
management tests goodwill for impairment annually by reporting unit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the face value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
in applying a fair value based test  estimates are made of the expected future cash flows to be derived from the reporting unit 
similar to the review for impairment of other long lived assets  the resulting fair value determination is significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
recent accounting developments in september  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
this standard was effective for our company on june  however  in february  the fasb released fasb staff position no 
fas effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
sfas no 
will become effective for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on june  the adoption of sfas no 
for our nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities is not expected to have a current material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
we adopted sfas no 
effective june  at this time  we have not elected to use the fair value measures permitted by this standard 
liquidity and capital resources in addition to cash and cash equivalents of million at may   our sources of liquidity include cash from operations and borrowings available under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
senior secured revolving credit facility 
on june   we amended and restated our credit agreement and the associated security agreement 
the credit agreement continues to provide for a million senior secured revolving credit facility with a million sub limit for letters of credit 
the credit facility matures on august  amounts drawn under the credit facility bear annual interest either at the libor rate plus a margin of to or at a base rate plus a margin of to 
the base rate is the higher of the federal funds rate plus  the prime rate established by bank of america  na or the one month libor rate plus 
the interest rate margins are determined based on our leverage ratio 
the commitment fee calculated on the unused portion of the credit facility range from to per year based on our leverage ratio 
we may terminate the credit facility at any time 
the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility is limited to an amount based on the value of our consolidated accounts receivable  inventory and mobile equipment 
this amount  called the borrowing base  may be less than the million stated principal amount of the credit facility 
the initial borrowing base under our amended agreement is million 
no borrowings were outstanding at may   however  million of the borrowing base was utilized to support letters of credit 
all of our consolidated subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by first priority security interests in all or most of our existing and future consolidated accounts  inventory  equipment  intellectual property and other personal property  and in all of our equity interests in present and future domestic subsidiaries and of the equity interest in any future foreign subsidiaries  if any 
the credit agreement contains a number of covenants restricting  among other things  prepayment or redemption of our senior notes  distributions and dividends on and repurchases of our capital stock  acquisitions and investments  indebtedness  liens and affiliate transactions 
we are not required to maintain any financial ratios or covenants unless an event of default occurs or borrowing availability under the borrowing base is less than million  in which case we must comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio 
we are permitted to pay cash dividends on our common stock as long as the credit facility is not in default  the fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than to and borrowing availability under the borrowing base is more than million 
we were in compliance with all of these loan covenants as of may

the following is a summary of our estimated future payments under our material contractual obligations as of may  future payments by period total after in thousands borrowings long term debt excluding capital leases interest operating leases supply and service contracts capital expenditures construction and equipment purchase obligations capital lease asset retirement obligations defined benefit plans see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for information regarding our long term debt 
our outstanding letters of credit issued under the senior secured revolving credit facility only collateralize payment of recorded liabilities 
we lease certain mobile and other equipment  office space and other items used in our operations under operating leases that in the normal course of business may be renewed or replaced by subsequent leases 
future payments under leases exclude mineral rights which are insignificant and are generally required only for products produced 
we purchase coal and other materials for use in our cement and expanded shale and clay plants that require minimum amounts of material be purchased 
these future minimum payment amounts exclude transportation surcharges that may be imposed under certain circumstances 
in addition  we purchase mining services for use at our north texas cement plant 
we expect to utilize these materials and services in the normal course of business operations 
we have entered into construction and equipment purchase contracts in connection with the expansion of our hunter  texas cement plant 
in light of current economic and market conditions we have delayed completion of the project 
we will resume construction when future economic and market conditions indicate it is appropriate 
we have entered into a long term contract with a power supplier which included the construction of certain power facilities at our oro grande  california cement plant 
we recognized a capital lease obligation of million related to payment obligations under the power supply contract related to these facilities 
the total commitment under the contract includes maintenance services to be provided by the power supplier 
we incur legal obligations for asset retirement as part of our normal operations related to land reclamation  plant removal and resource conservation and recovery act closures 
we pay benefits under a series of non qualified defined benefit plans 
we pay benefits under a health benefit plan covering approximately employees and retirees of our california cement subsidiary 
these employees are also covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan 
we contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws plus additional amounts considered appropriate 
we expect to make plan contributions of million in fiscal year 
table of contents during october  we commenced construction on a project to expand our hunter  texas cement plant

we believe the delay conserved million to million of cash expenditures in fiscal years and until we determine the date that we will resume construction  we cannot accurately estimate the cost of completing the project 
we expect cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  and available borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility to be sufficient to provide funds for capital expenditure commitments currently estimated at million to million for assuming we do not resume construction on the hunter plant expansion during fiscal year  scheduled debt payments  working capital needs and other general corporate purposes for at least the next year 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year increased million from fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of changes in working capital items including decreases in receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities which offset lower income from operations excluding depreciation  depletion and amortization and the charge for goodwill impairment

capital expenditures in fiscal year include investments in our north texas aggregate operations to upgrade our rail distribution system and improve our production facilities 
proceeds from asset disposals in fiscal year include the proceeds from the sale of operating assets and real estate associated with our aggregate operations in north texas and south louisiana 
in connection with these sales  proceeds of million were held by a qualified intermediary trust for reinvestment in deferred like kind exchange transactions 
completion of our deferred like kind exchange transactions in fiscal year reduced the cash designated for property acquisitions that was being held by a qualified intermediary trust by million

other items environmental matters we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws  regulations and permits concerning  among other matters  air emissions and wastewater discharge 
we intend to comply with these laws  regulations and permits 
however  from time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that we are or may be in violation of certain of these laws  regulations and permits  or from private parties alleging that our operations have injured them or their property 
see legal proceedings in item  business  for a description of certain claims 
it is possible that we could be held liable for future charges which might be material but are not currently known or estimable 
in addition  changes in federal or state laws  regulations or requirements or discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures by us 
market risk historically  we have not entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because of the short duration of our investments  changes in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on their fair value 
the fair value of fixed rate debt will vary as interest rates change 
the estimated fair value of each class of financial instrument as of may  approximates its carrying value except for long term debt having fixed interest rates 
at may   the fair value of our long term debt having fixed interest rates  estimated based on broker dealer quoted market prices  is approximately million compared to the carrying amount of million 
with respect to borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility  which are variable rate debt  a percent change in interest rates for the year ended may   would not have resulted in a significant annual change in our pretax earnings and cash flows 
our operations require large amounts of energy and are dependent upon energy sources  including electricity and fossil fuels 
prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control 
we have generally not entered into any long term contracts to satisfy our fuel and electricity needs  with the exception of coal which we purchase from specific mines pursuant to long term contracts 
however  we continually monitor these markets and we may decide in the future to enter into long term contracts 
if we are unable to meet our requirements for fuel and electricity  we may experience interruptions in our production 
price increases or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of these products could adversely affect our results of operations
