about group the about group principally generates revenues from cost per click advertising sponsored links for which the about group is paid when a user clicks on the ad  display advertising that is relevant to its adjacent content  and e commerce including sales lead generation 
almost all of its revenues in are derived from the sale of advertisements cost per click and display advertising 
cost per click advertising accounted for of the about group s total advertising revenues 
the about group s main operating costs are employee related costs and content and hosting costs 
joint ventures our investments accounted for under the equity method are as follows a interest in metro boston  which publishes a free daily newspaper in the greater boston area  a interest in a canadian newsprint company  malbaie  a interest in a partnership  madison  operating a supercalendered paper mill in maine  a interest in quadrantone  an online advertising network that sells bundled premium  targeted display advertising onto local newspaper and other web sites and a interest in nesv  which owns the boston red sox  fenway park and adjacent real estate  of new england sports network the regional cable sports network that televises the red sox games and of roush fenway racing  a leading nascar team 
in january  we announced that we are exploring the possible sale of our interest in nesv 
business environment we believe that a number of factors and industry trends have had  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on our business and prospects 
these include the following economic conditions the recent slowdown in the economy has adversely affected  and is expected to continue to adversely affect  our advertising revenues  as well as reduce our financing flexibility 
advertising spending  which drives a significant portion of our revenues  is susceptible to economic conditions 
in  declines in advertising revenues experienced in the first nine months accelerated in the fourth quarter  when the economic downturn exacerbated the declines in print and interrupted the growth trajectory of our digital businesses 
national and local economic conditions  particularly in the new york city and boston metropolitan regions  as well as in florida and california  have affected the levels of our classified  national and retail advertising revenue 
classified advertising  which is an important category at all of our newspaper properties  declined significantly throughout the year  particularly help wanted 
changes in spending patterns and priorities  including shifts in marketing strategies and budget cuts of key advertisers  in response to continuing and deepening softness in the economy  have depressed and may c ontinue to depress our advertising revenue 
we believe that advertising revenues are likely to continue to be challenged in the deteriorating economic conditions also tightened credit markets  making it more difficult and costly for us to obtain replacement financing for existing debt 
increasing competition we face significant competition for advertising revenue in various markets and competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of digital media technologies 
we expect that technological developments will continue to favor digital media choices  intensifying the challenges posed by audience fragmentation 
we have expanded and will continue to expand our digital offerings  however  most of our revenues are currently from traditional print products where advertising revenues are declining 
we believe this decline  particularly in classified advertising  is due to a shift to digital media or to other forms of media and marketing in addition to the economic conditions mentioned above 
circulation circulation is another significant source of revenue for us 
circulation revenues are affected by circulation and readership levels 
in recent years  our newspaper properties  and the newspaper industry as a whole  have experienced difficulty maintaining and increasing circulation volume 
this is due to  among other factors  increased competition from new media formats and sources other than traditional newspapers often free to users  declining discretionary spending by consumers  higher subscription and newsstand rates charged to customers and a growing preference among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper

costs a significant portion of our costs are fixed costs and therefore we are limited in our ability to reduce costs in the short term 
our most significant costs are employee related costs and raw materials  which together accounted for approximately of our total costs in changes in employee related costs and the price and availability of newsprint can materially affect our operating results 
pension obligations as a result of significant declines in the equity markets in  the funded status of our qualified pension plans was adversely affected 
see the pension and postretirement benefits section below for additional information regarding our pension plans  including their underfunded status 
for a discussion of these and other factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition  see forward looking statements and item a risk factors 
our strategy we anticipate that the challenges we currently face will continue  and we believe that the following elements are key to our efforts to address them 
introducing new products and services we are addressing the increasingly fragmented media landscape by building on the strength of our brands  particularly of the times 
because of our high quality content  we have very powerful and trusted brands that attract educated  affluent and influential audiences 
to further leverage these brands  we have introduced and will continue to introduce a number of new products and services 
we want to offer our consumers news  information and entertainment wherever and whenever our audience want it in print or online  in text  graphics  audio  video or even live events 
in  we introduced the times on new digital platforms  significantly expanded and deepened our online business coverage on nytimes 
com  and added new tools and multimedia features across our properties 
strengthening our digital businesses and research and development capabilities online  our goal is to grow our digital businesses by broadening our audiences  deepening engagement and monetizing the usage of our web sites 
we have a more diversified revenue base mainly because nytimes 
com attracts a diverse base of national advertisers and about 
com generates most of its revenues from cost per click and display advertising 
our goal for nytimes 
com is to build a fully interactive news and information platform  achieving sustainable leadership positions in our most profitable content areas or verticals 
we have made and expect to continue to make investments to grow these areas of our web sites that have the highest advertiser demand 
our research and development group also helps us monitor the changing media and technology landscape so that we can anticipate consumer preferences and devise innovative ways of satisfying them 
this has led to the development of new digital products across the company and accelerated our entry onto new platforms  such as mobile 
restructuring our cost base managing costs is a key component of our strategy and remains a priority in in light of weakening economic conditions and secular trends 
we continuously review our cost structure to ensure that we are operating our businesses efficiently 
our focus is on streamlining our operations  eliminating unnecessary costs and achieving cost benefits from productivity gains  while maintaining the quality of our journalism and achieving our long term strategy 
we have focused our cost restructuring efforts on the following key areas consolidating our operations  closing businesses that are not meeting their financial targets  outsourcing  optimizing circulation  reducing newsprint consumption  reducing employee related costs and rationalizing our cost base relative to expected future revenue 
consolidating our operations in march  we completed the consolidation of our two new york area printing plants into one facility in college point  ny  which we estimate will result in savings of approximately million in annual operating costs 
we plan to close our printing plant in billerica  mass  and consolidate the printing of the globe into our main printing plant in boston  mass 
the consolidation is expected to be completed during the second half of and result in about million in annual savings 
at our regional media group  we have completed the consolidation of the mailrooms of our gainesville and ocala  fla 
papers  and we are looking at consolidating their production facilities 
closing businesses in january  we closed city suburban  which operated a wholesale distribution business that delivered the times and other newspapers and magazines to newsstands and retail outlets in the new york metropolitan area 
the closure is estimated to improve our operating results by approximately million on an annual basis  excluding one time costs 
this is a result of an p 
annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations estimated decrease in costs of approximately million to operate city suburban  offset in part by an estimated decrease in revenue of approximately million 
the revenue decrease is expected to be in other revenues from the elimination of delivering third party publications and in circulation revenue from the sale of the times to wholesale distributors rather than retailers 
outsourcing we have outsourced certain functions  including circulation  telemarketing  customer service and financial back office functions 
at some of our smaller newspapers  we have outsourced printing to outside facilities 
optimizing circulation we have reduced promotion  production  distribution and other costs related to less profitable circulation 
by focusing our efforts on acquisition channels that have the best retention and are the most profitable  we expect to achieve higher margins despite declines in overall circulation volume 
reducing newsprint consumption as part of our continuing efforts to reduce our newsprint consumption  we have reduced the printed page of the majority of our newspapers across the company since  including the times  the globe  the t g and nine regional newspapers 
with these reductions  we expect to save approximately million annually from decreased newsprint consumption 
evaluating employee related costs we reduced our headcount across the company in by year end  the number of full time equivalent employees was approximately percent lower than year end  and in january  the closure of city suburban led to a reduction of approximately full time equivalent employees 
we will continually evaluate all employee related costs as we monitor our overall financial health 
rebalancing our portfolio of businesses over the past several years  we have been rebalancing our portfolio of businesses  focusing more on growth areas  such as digital 
we also continue to evaluate our businesses to determine whether they are meeting our targets for financial performance  growth and return on investment and whether they remain relevant to our strategy 
in january  we announced that we are exploring the possible sale of our interest in nesv 
allocating capital and improving our liquidity in light of deteriorating economic conditions  we have taken decisive steps to reduce capital spending and improve our liquidity 
we are strongly focused on conserving cash 
in  we expect our capital expenditures will decrease to approximately million from approximately million in in november  our board of directors reduced our fourth quarter dividend from 
per share to 
per share and in february  the board suspended our quarterly dividend 
in january  we completed a private financing transaction for million in senior unsecured notes and warrants 
the net proceeds from this transaction were used to repurchase medium term notes and repay amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities 
we also continue to explore other financing initiatives  including a possible sale leaseback transaction for up to million for part of the space we own in our new york headquarters 
we remain focused on reducing our total debt 
we plan to do so through the cash we generate from our businesses and the decisive steps we have taken to reduce costs  lower capital spending  suspend our dividend and rebalance our portfolio of assets 
these were difficult but prudent decisions that we believe will provide us with greater financial flexibility in the current economic environment and the uncertain business outlook 
expectations for  we expect depreciation and amortization to be to million  which includes accelerated depreciation of approximately million related to the closing of our printing plant in billerica  mass 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million  including about million for a plant consolidation and a systems project at the news media group

impairment of assets in the first quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million for the write down of assets for a systems project at the news media group 
we reduced the scope of a major advertising and circulation project to decrease capital spending  which resulted in the write down of previously capitalized costs 
in the third quarter of  we performed an interim impairment test at the new england media group  which is part of the news media group reportable segment  due to certain impairment indicators  including the continued decline in print advertising revenue affecting the newspaper industry and lower than expected current and projected operating results 
the assets tested include goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  other long lived assets being amortized and an equity method investment in metro boston 
we did not finalize our interim impairment analysis in the third quarter of  due to the timing and complexity of the calculations  but recorded an estimated non cash impairment charge of million 
we finalized our interim impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and concluded that no adjustment to the estimated charge was necessary 
this impairment charge reduced the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets of the new england media group to zero 
the fair value of the new england media group s goodwill is the residual fair value after allocating the total fair value of the new england media group to its other assets  net of liabilities 
the total fair value of the new england media group was estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow model present value of future cash flows and a market approach model based on comparable businesses 
the goodwill is not tax deductible because the acquisition of the globe was structured as a tax free stock transaction 
the fair value of the masthead at the new england media group was calculated using a relief from royalty method and the fair value of the customer list was calculated by estimating the present value of associated future cash flows 
the property  plant and equipment of the new england media group was estimated at fair value less cost to sell 
the fair value was determined giving consideration to market and income approaches to value 
the carrying value of our investment in metro boston was written down to fair value because the business had experienced lower than expected growth and we anticipated lower growth compared with previous projections  leading management to conclude that the investment was other than temporarily impaired 
the impairment was recorded within net income loss from joint ventures 
our annual impairment test  which was completed in the fourth quarter  resulted in an additional non cash impairment charge of million relating to the iht masthead 
the impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the iht masthead to zero 
the asset impairment mainly resulted from lower projected operating results and cash flows primarily due to the economic downturn and secular decline of print advertising revenues 
the fair value of the masthead was calculated using a relief from royalty method 
in connection with our annual impairment test  no goodwill impairment was recognized at the regional media group  a reporting unit that includes approximately million of goodwill 
however  because the regional media group s estimated fair value approximates its carrying value  we believe that if the economic downturn and the secular decline in print advertising have a greater impact than expected on its cash flows  an interim impairment test would be necessary and a goodwill impairment charge could be likely 
we also reviewed whether an interim impairment test was necessary in the fourth quarter subsequent to our annual impairment assessment date  given a decline in market capitalization 
however  we believed the decline was not related to lower fair values of the company s reporting units  but rather to negative market conditions due to the credit crisis  the economic recession and the current issues in the industry and  as a result  an interim impairment test was not required 
in and  our annual impairment testing resulted in non cash impairment charges of million and million  respectively  related to write downs of intangible assets  including goodwill  at the new england media group and our metro boston investment 
the asset impairments mainly resulted from declines in current and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the new york times company p

income taxes we had an income tax benefit of million in compared with income tax expense of million in the effective income tax rate was in compared with in in  the effective income tax rate was lower because of non deductible losses on investments in company owned life insurance policies and non deductible goodwill impairment charges 
in  the effective income tax rate was affected by the asset sales in the second quarter of see notes  and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and an unfavorable tax adjustment for a change in new york state tax law 
in  the effective income tax rate was because the majority of the non cash impairment charge of million at the new england media group was non deductible for tax purposes and  therefore decreased the effective income tax rate by approximately

our advertising revenues have been adversely affected by increased competition arising from the growth of media alternatives  including distribution of news  entertainment and other information over the internet and through mobile phones and other devices 
a secular shift from print advertising to online alternatives has contributed and will likely continue to contribute to significant declines in print advertising revenues 
in addition  the disruption in the global economy has adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our level of advertising revenues and a failure of economic conditions to improve most likely will continue to adversely affect our cash inflows from operations 
the deteriorating economic conditions have also tightened credit markets  making it more difficult and costly for us to obtain replacement financing for our existing debt

annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ratings in april  standard poor s lowered its investment rating on our long term debt to bbb from bbb 
in october  it again lowered its rating  to a below investment grade rating of bb  with a negative outlook  citing the effects on our operating performance of a likely us recession over the immediate term accelerating secular advertising revenue declines 
in april  moody s investors service downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to baa from baa  and in january  it downgraded our senior unsecured rating to ba from baa  citing weakened operating performance expectations and a significant increase in our underfunded pension obligation 
we have no liabilities subject to accelerated payment upon a ratings downgrade and do not expect a material increase in our current borrowing costs as a result of these ratings actions 
however  we expect that any future long term borrowings or the extension or replacement of our short term borrowing facilities will reflect the impact of our below investment grade ratings  increasing our borrowing costs  limiting our financing options  including limiting our access to the unsecured borrowing market  and subjecting us to more restrictive covenants appropriate for non investment grade issuers 
additional reductions in our credit ratings could further increase our borrowing costs  subject us to more onerous terms and reduce our borrowing flexibility in the future 
revolving credit agreements our million revolving credit agreements million credit agreement maturing in may and million credit agreement maturing in june are used for general corporate purposes

these liabilities are not included in the table above primarily because the future payments are not determinable 
the dec plan enables certain eligible executives to elect to defer a portion of their compensation on a pre tax basis 
while the deferrals are initially for a period of a minimum of two years after which time taxable distributions must begin  the executive has the option to extend the deferral period 
therefore  the future payments under the dec plan are not determinable

annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe our critical accounting policies include our accounting for long lived assets  retirement benefits  stock based compensation  income taxes  self insurance liabilities and accounts receivable allowances 
additional information about these policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
specific risks related to our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
long lived assets goodwill and other intangible assets not amortized are tested for impairment in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  and all other long lived assets are tested for impairment in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in millions december  december  long lived assets   total assets   percentage of long lived assets to total assets the impairment analysis is considered critical to our segments because of the significance of long lived assets to our consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets not amortized on an annual basis or in an interim period if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist 
all other long lived assets are tested for impairment if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment exists 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 
the reporting units are our operating segments  as defined by fas separate financial information about these segments is regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value is calculated by a combination of a discounted cash flow model present value of future cash flows and a market approach model based on comparable businesses 
in calculating fair value for each reporting unit  we generally weigh the results of the discounted cash flow model more heavily than the market approach because the discounted cash flow model is specific to our business and long term projections 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodw ill 
an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we also perform a reconciliation of our market capitalization to the total fair value of our reporting units 
the reconciliation is completed to corroborate that the fair value used to test goodwill is reasonable 
our market capitalization is calculated based on the market price of our stock in the period of approximately two weeks before and after the date of our goodwill impairment assessment 
intangible assets that are not amortized eg  mastheads and trade names are tested for impairment at the asset level by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
fair value is calculated utilizing the relief from royalty method  which is based on applying a royalty rate  which would be obtained through a lease  to the cash flows derived from the asset being tested 
the royalty rate is derived from market data 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  the asset is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset 
all other long lived assets intangible assets that are amortized  such as customer lists  and property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment at the asset group level associated with the lowest level of cash flows 
an impairment exists if the carrying value of the asset i is not recoverable the carrying value of the asset is greater than the sum of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the new york times company p 
undiscounted cash flows and ii is greater than its fair value 
the significant estimates and assumptions used by management in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  other intangible assets acquired and other long lived assets are estimated future cash flows  discount rates  growth rates  as well as other factors 
any changes in these estimates or assumptions could result in an impairment charge 
the estimates  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgment 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated results of the impairment tests can vary within a range of outcomes 
in addition to annual testing  management uses certain indicators to evaluate whether the carrying values of its long lived assets may not be recoverable and an interim impairment test may be required 
these indicators include i current period operating or cash flow declines combined with a history of operating or cash flow declines or a projection forecast that demonstrates continuing declines in the cash flow of an entity or inability of an entity to improve its operations to forecasted levels  ii a significant adverse change in the business climate  whether structural or technological  that could affect the value of an entity and iii a decline in our stock price and market capitalization 
management has applied what it believes to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of its reporting units 
our testing has resulted in impairment charges in  and see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets fsp r that will expand the disclosure requirements for pension plan assets 
we consider accounting for retirement plans critical to all of our operating segments because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the impact from our pension and postretirement benefits could vary within a range of outcomes and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see the following section pension and postretirement benefits that discusses our retirement benefits in further detail 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of fas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the appropriate vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stock based compensation expens e 
income taxes we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets

 accounting for income taxes fas 
under fas  income taxes are recognized for the following i amount of taxes payable for the current year and ii deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes in the period of enactment 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our process includes collecting positive eg  sources of taxable income and negative eg  historical losses over a three year period evidence and assessing  based on the evidence  whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in accordance with fin  we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
this involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions  the evaluation of tax law and an assessment of whether a liability for uncertain tax positions is necessary 
different conclusions reached in this assessment can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which could require an extended period of time to resolve 
until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities  the timing and amount of a possible audit settlement for uncertain tax benefits is difficult to predict 
self insurance we self insure for workers compensation costs  certain employee medical and disability benefits  and automobile and general liability claims 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are primarily calculated using actuarial methods 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims  claim growth and claims incurred but not yet reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in different liabilities than the amounts currently recorded 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks were approximately million as of december  and million as of december  accounts receivable allowances credit is extended to our advertisers and subscribers based upon an evaluation of the customers financial condition  and collateral is not required from such customers 
we use prior credit losses as a percentage of credit sales  the aging of accounts receivable and specific identification of potential losses to establish reserves for credit losses on accounts receivable 
in addition  we establish reserves for estimated rebates  returns  rate adjustments and discounts based on historical experience 
in millions december  december  accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable net accounts receivable gross total current assets percentage of accounts receivable allowances to gross accounts receivable percentage of net accounts receivable to current assets we consider accounting for accounts receivable allowances critical to all of our operating segments because of the significance of accounts receivable to our current assets and operating cash flows 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required  which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement benefits in millions december  december  pension and postretirement liabilities  total liabilities   percentage of pension and postretirement liabilities to total liabilities pension benefits we sponsor several pension plans  participate in the new york times newspaper guild pension plan  a joint company and guild sponsored plan  and make contributions to several others  in connection with collective bargaining agreements  that are considered multi employer pension plans 
these plans cover substantially all employees 
our company sponsored plans include qualified funded plans as well as non qualified unfunded plans 
these plans provide participating management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the new york times company p 
employees with retirement benefits in accordance with benefit provision formulas detailed in each plan 
our non qualified plans provide retirement benefits only to certain highly compensated employees 
we also have a foreign based pension plan for certain iht employees the foreign plan 
the information for the foreign plan is combined with the information for us non qualified plans 
the benefit obligation of the foreign plan is immaterial to our total benefit obligation 
the funded status of our qualified and non qualified pension plans as of december  is as follows december  in millions qualified plans non qualified plans all plans pension obligation   fair value of plan assets pension underfunded obligation as a result of significant declines in the equity markets in  the funded status of our qualified pension plans was adversely affected 
as of december   the underfunded pension obligation for our qualified pension plans was approximately million measured in accordance with gaap and approximately million measured in accordance with the employee retirement income security act erisa 
the regulations under gaap and erisa differ  for example with respect to the guidance on selecting a discount rate to calculate the pension obligation  and therefore result in different underfunded balances 
if the equity markets do not sufficiently recover  the discount rate does not increase and there is no legislative relief  we will be required to make significant contributions to close the million funding gap 
we expect no contributions with respect to this underfunded amount will be required in because of our pension fundin g credits 
however  we will make contractual funding contributions of approximately to million in connection with the new york times newspaper guild pension plan  a joint company and guild sponsored plan 
in and  we made contractual funding contributions of approximately million and million  respectively to the guild plan 
pension expense is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on assets for qualified plans and a discount rate 
our methodology in selecting these actuarial assumptions is discussed below 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on assets  we evaluated input from our investment consultants  actuaries and investment management firms  including their review of asset class return expectations  as well as long term historical asset class returns 
projected returns by such consultants and economists are based on broad equity and bond indices 
the expected long term rate of return determined on this basis was in we anticipate that our pension assets will generate long term returns on assets of at least 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of to with equity managers  with an expected long term rate of return on assets of  and to with fixed income real estate managers  with an expected long term rate of return on assets of 
our actual asset allocation as of december  was in line with our expectations 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
our plan assets had a loss of approximately in we believe that an expected long term rate of return of is reasonable because our goal is to maintain our current investment strategy with our target investment allocation and we expect that over a period of time asset returns will revert back to historical levels for each investment class 
our determination of pension expense or income is based on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation of assets recognizes investment gains or losses over a three year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the p 
annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a three year period  the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
if we had decreased our expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by in  pension expense would have increased by approximately million in for our qualified pension plans 
our funding requirements would not have been materially affected 
in  we determined our discount rate using a ryan alm  inc curve ryan curve 
the ryan curve was not available at our prior measurement date  which is the last day of our fiscal year 
in previous years we utilized the citigroup pension discount curve 
we switched to the ryan curve because it provides the bonds included in the curve and allows adjustments for certain outliers eg  bonds on watch 
we believe that this additional information and flexibility allows us to calculate a better estimate of a discount rate 
to determine the discount rate  we produce a cash flow of annual accrued benefits as defined under the projected unit cost method as provided by fas for active participants  service is projected to the current measurement date and benefit earnings are projected to the date of termination 
the projected plan cash flow is discounted to the measurement date using the annual spot rates provided in the ryan curve 
a single discount rate is then computed so that the present value of the benefit cash flow on a projected benefit obligation basis as described above equals the present value computed using the ryan curve rates 
the discount rate determined on this basis was for our qualified plans and for our non qualified plans as of december  if we had decreased the expected discount rate by in  pension expense would have increased by approximately million for our qualified pension plans and approximately million for our non qualified pension plans 
our funding requirements would not have been materially affected 
as of december   we reduced our rate of increase in compensation levels assumption to from 
this change was made to better reflect our expectation on compensation increases going forward 
we will continue to evaluate all of our actuarial assumptions  generally on an annual basis  and will adjust as necessary 
actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates  the level of contributions we make and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans 
postretirement benefits we provide health and life insurance benefits to retired employees and their eligible dependents that are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements  if the employees meet specified age and service requirements 
in addition  we contribute to a postretirement plan under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement 
our policy is to pay our portion of insurance premiums and claims from our assets 
in accordance with fas  we accrue the costs of postretirement benefits during the employees active years of service 
the annual postretirement expense was calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including a health care cost trend rate and a discount rate 
the health care cost trend rate range decreased to to as of december  from to as of december  a increase decrease in the health care cost trend rates range would result in an increase of approximately million or a decrease of approximately million in our service and interest costs  respectively  two factors included in the calculation of postretirement expense 
a increase decrease in the health care cost trend rates would result in an increase of approximately million or a decrease of approximately million  in our accumulated benefit obligation as of december  our discount rate assumption for postretirement benefits is consistent with that used in the calculation of pension benefits
