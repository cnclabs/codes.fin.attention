item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of this annual report on form k 
overview of performance and company and industry trends 
the overall economic downturn  led by the decline in the housing market  had an unfavorable effect on the company and the execution of its strategy of developing and managing high quality real estate in the continued depressed nature of the housing market adversely affected the company s residential land business as well as its multi family business 
the soft economic environment combined with tightening credit markets eroded consumer demand thus causing lower than expected retail sales 
as a result  many of the company s retail tenants suffered a range of problems from lowering the number of new store openings to store closures and bankruptcies 
demand for new and existing office space declined during with the weakening fundamentals  which put downward pressure on rental rates 
the company was not as severely impacted by the problems with the credit markets as certain other real estate companies because it had no significant short term debt maturities 
however  the company s access to capital has been reduced  at least in the near term  and financing terms have become much less favorable than in previous years 
as a result of the economic environment  the company commenced no new development projects in however  development activities continued on projects commenced in prior years  and the company worked on several projects that it expects to commence in or when market conditions improve 
during the year  the company opened two retail centers the avenue forsyth  in north metropolitan atlanta  and tiffany springs marketcenter  in kansas city  missouri 
in addition  the company completed construction of palisades west  a two building office project in austin  texas  and completed construction of terminus place  a unit condominium development in the buckhead district of atlanta 
the company continued development of terminus  a  square foot office building  adjacent to the terminus place project  and expects to complete construction of this building in the second half of throughout  the company continued to seek attractive new development projects in spite of the depressed markets 
one of these projects is a potential mixed use development in atlanta adjacent to emory university and the centers for disease control 
this project is expected to include retail  condominiums and apartments  with the apartment portion being developed by another company 
in addition  the company is pursuing a retail outlet center in oklahoma city in a joint venture with an experienced outlet mall developer 
while these projects have been delayed due to market conditions  the company expects to commence them in or when market conditions improve 
the company does not currently expect any other traditional new development projects to be commenced in the company s land business continued to decline in lot sales steadily fell throughout the year reflecting the overall weakness in the residential markets 
within the company s markets  new home sales have slowed and builders hold lot inventories that will more than meet the anticipated demand for the foreseeable future 
until these inventories fall  management does not expect much improvement in the volume of its residential lot sales 
the company has ceased the development of additional lots in most projects and will work to continue to reduce its lot inventory until the markets begin to recover 
while management is optimistic about the long term profitability of its land business  it is unable to determine when market conditions will turn more favorable for the company 
likewise  the condominium market continues to be unfavorable overall and within the company s core markets 
during the year  the company sold substantially all of the remaining residential units at its biscayne project in miami  thereby effectively exiting this unfavorable market 
however  the company only closed units in its recently completed terminus place project and only of the remaining units are under contract 
in addition  the company has suspended development at its glenmore garden villas project in charlotte  north carolina  which has six substantially completed units 
the company intends to commence construction of the remaining units when market conditions warrant 
other than the emory project noted above  the company does not expect to commence any new multi family development projects in 
table of contents in spite of the economic conditions  occupancy at the company s stabilized office properties remained consistent throughout while results at its newly developed and redeveloped properties were mixed 
as of december   stabilized office properties were leased  a slight improvement over the prior year 
this improvement is the result of increases in occupancy at three of the company s north point buildings and to the sale of the vacant windy hill road building 
occupancy at the company s stabilized retail properties decreased in  partially as a result of the bankruptcies of linens n things and circuit city 
leasing at the company s newly developed retail projects increased modestly in  but is below the levels the company has historically experienced for newly developed properties 
at december   the avenue murfreesboro was leased  the avenue forsyth was leased and tiffany springs marketcenter was leased 
management believes that these relatively low leasing percentages are directly attributable to the decline in consumer demand and the retailers reaction to this decline 
management believes that these properties remain in favorable locations and believes that occupancy will improve once economic conditions improve 
in the near term  management is concerned that retailer bankruptcies and store closings could cause the leasing percentage and occupancy at its centers to decline 
many of the company s tenants negotiate co tenancy clauses into their lease agreements which allow them to reduce their rents or close their stores in the event that a certain number of co tenants close their stores or if overall occupancy declines below a certain level 
bankruptcies or store closings could cause certain other tenants to reduce their rents or terminate their leases  thereby having an adverse effect on cash flows 
the company has not executed any office leases at its under construction terminus building  which it believes is a result of the economic downturn 
while the company is working on multiple prospects  there is no guarantee that any leases will be executed until market conditions improve 
the company made progress in the lease up of peachtree tower 
in  the company renewed and expanded the deloitte touche lease  which  together with other leases  equaled new or renewing space of  nearly offsetting expiring leases at the building 
the company s third party management business improved during the company added a net of million square feet of properties under management and or leasing during the year  bringing the aggregate total to million square feet 
in addition  management believes that the company s capital structure is sound  which is particularly important in this period of tightening credit 
prior to  the company took steps to improve its capital structure by recasting and extending its credit facility  entering into long term  fixed rate mortgage loans  and selectively selling assets 
as a result  the company has low near term maturities of debt and has adequate cash on hand and availability under its credit facility to complete all development commitments currently in progress 
management believes that it will meet all financial covenants in its credit agreements for the foreseeable future 
while management believes that opportunities for traditional office and retail development projects will be limited in and beyond  management expects other  more non traditional  opportunities for creating stockholder value may emerge as various macroeconomic factors  such as changes in the credit markets  make it difficult for less capitalized developers or owners to commence or sustain development projects 
if these opportunities present themselves  management believes the company is well positioned to act upon them as a result of its relatively conservative capital structure and availability under its credit facility 
critical accounting policies 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and the notes to consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies for the company 
a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing office  retail and industrial real estate properties  developing multi family residential units  and developing single family residential communities which are parceled into lots and sold to various home builders 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to its long lived assets  including cost capitalization  depreciation and amortization  and impairment of long lived assets including investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  revenue recognition  including residential lot sales  land tract sales  multi family residential unit sales and valuation of receivables  and accounting for investments in non wholly owned entities 

table of contents long lived assets cost capitalization 
the company is involved in all stages of real estate development 
the company charges predevelopment costs to expense on a project until it becomes probable defined as more likely than not that the project will go forward 
after management determines the project is probable  all subsequently incurred predevelopment costs  as well as interest  real estate taxes and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to the project under development  are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  and sfas no 
 accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
if the company abandons development of a project that had earlier been deemed probable  the company charges all previously capitalized costs to expense 
therefore  if management changes its assessment of the probability that a project will ultimately be developed  predevelopment expenses could be higher or lower than they otherwise would have been 
furthermore  if management determines that a project that was previously determined to be probable is no longer probable  the company s predevelopment expenses could be significantly greater because all capitalized predevelopment costs associated with that project would be charged to expense in the period that this change occurs 
the company had approximately million of capitalized predevelopment assets as of december  additionally  determination of when construction of a project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy requires judgment 
in accordance with sfas nos 
and  the company capitalizes direct and related indirect project costs associated with development projects during the construction period 
once a project is deemed substantially complete and held for occupancy  subsequent carrying costs  such as real estate taxes  interest  internal personnel and associated costs  are expensed as incurred 
the company considers projects and or project phases substantially complete and held for occupancy at the earlier of the date on which the phase reached occupancy of or one year from the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 
the company s judgment of the date the project is substantially complete has a direct impact on the company s operating expenses and net income for the period 
depreciation and amortization 
the company depreciates or amortizes real estate assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of depreciation 
management uses its judgment when estimating the life of the real estate assets and when allocating certain indirect project costs to projects under development 
historical data  comparable properties and replacement costs are some of the factors considered in determining useful lives and cost allocations 
if management incorrectly estimates the useful lives of the company s real estate assets or if cost allocations are not appropriate  then depreciation and amortization may not be reflected properly in the company s results of operations 
the company generally amortizes tenant costs over the lease term 
in certain situations  the tenant may not fulfill its commitment under its lease  and the estimated amortization period of those tenant assets could change 
in  some of the company s retail tenants have experienced bankruptcy or have modified the terms of their lease  which resulted in accelerated amortization of tenant costs  thereby directly affecting the current year s net income 
impairment of long lived assets 
real estate assets the company has real estate assets in varying degrees of development from raw land to operating properties 
management reviews its real estate assets for impairment indicators  such as a decline in a property s leasing percentage  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses at the property  a decline in market prices  an adverse change in tenants industries or other changes in the market 
if management determines that indicators of impairment are present  management reviews the properties it judges affected by these indicators for impairment 
with the recent decline in the housing market and the overall economic downturn  management has determined that indicators of impairment are present on several of the company s real estate assets 
therefore  the company evaluated these assets for recoverability 
these analyses require significant judgment on the part of management 
first  a determination of the intent and ability to hold these assets affects the type of analyses performed 
if an asset is considered as held for use  as described in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the recoverability of the asset is assessed based on the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  the asset is determined to be impaired  and the 
table of contents impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
if an asset is considered to be held for sale  as described in sfas no 
 the asset is carried at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the company performs its real estate valuation assessments based on current market conditions utilizing assumptions which could differ materially from actual results 
unconsolidated joint ventures generally follow the same impairment assessment of their properties as the company 
these assumptions are highly subjective and susceptible to frequent change  and several assumptions are enumerated in the next paragraph 
in analyzing the undiscounted cash flows and fair value of assets with indicators of impairment  management estimates market rental rates it believes it can obtain at certain properties in the future  cash outlays to generate leases  market capitalization rates for residual values and other estimates 
for residential developments  management estimates sales prices  costs to complete development  carry costs  competitive projects  and other such items 
given the current state of the economy and market for real estate  the timing of a market turnaround is a significant estimate and one that requires considerable judgment  as well as rental rates that will be in effect in future years 
management reviews similar products in the market in which its assets are held and adjusts its hold period  sales volume  pricing  and other factors as it deems necessary 
the cyclical nature of the real estate industry  combined with the current credit market difficulties  availability of high levels of existing inventories in the locations of the company s assets  consumer confidence  retailer health  employment levels and additional factors  all enter into management s judgment as a result of this analysis 
in addition  the expected use of the company s assets could change over the coming periods as management obtains more information on the market turnaround 
in addition  the discount rates utilized to estimate the fair value of assets can vary greatly based on the risk associated with the asset  which normally is affected by the type of project  the stage of its life cycle  and the location of the asset 
the fair value of an asset can materially change if the discount rate changes 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million on its completed for sale  multi family project terminus place in at the cl realty venture level  an impairment loss was recognized on one of this venture s residential developments  the company s share of which was  in management does not believe any of its other assets or assets at its joint ventures are impaired at this time  but will continue to monitor the state of the economy and the expected results of its assets 
investment in joint ventures additionally  management performs an impairment analysis of its investments in joint ventures in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb no 

in accordance with apb no 
 at each reporting period  management reviews its investments in joint ventures for indicators of impairment 
if indicators of impairment are present for any of the company s investments in joint ventures  apb no 
requires management to calculate the fair value of the investment 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  management must determine whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
if management assesses the impairment as temporary  the company does not record an impairment charge 
if management concludes that the impairment is other than temporary  the company records an impairment charge 
the company did not record an impairment in any of its investment in joint ventures in  or consistent with the sfas no 
analysis  management uses considerable judgment in determining whether there are indicators of impairment present and in the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the investment 
management also uses judgment in making the determination as to whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
staff accounting bulletin topic m sab m provides guidance for management to use in making the determination of whether the impairment is temporary 
sab m indicates that companies consider the length of time that the impairment has existed  the financial condition of the joint venture and the ability and intent of the holder to retain the investment long enough for a recovery in market value 
considerable judgment is required by management to make these determinations 
if management incorrectly concludes that an impairment is temporary  the company s financial statements may not include an impairment charge that would have had an adverse impact on its results of operations 
likewise  if management changes its conclusion that an impairment is temporary  the company could be required to record a significant impairment charge at that point 

table of contents revenue recognition residential lot  multi family and land tract sales 
in its determination of the gross profit recognized on its residential lot  multi family and land tract sales  the company utilizes several estimates 
management calculates gross profit percentages based on estimated sales prices and the estimated costs of the development 
markets for certain products can change over time as the project is selling 
therefore  historical sales prices may not be indicative of the project s prices over its lifetime and sales may not occur at a consistent rate 
therefore sales price estimates made by management require a high degree of estimation 
the housing market is currently in a severe decline  the severity and duration of which cannot be predicted at this point 
past estimates and assumptions did not predict the magnitude of this decline  nor the current state of the credit markets 
in addition  management must estimate the costs to complete the development of the residential or multi family community or the cost of the land tract improvements 
if the company s estimated lot  unit or land tract sales  timing or costs of development  or any of the underlying assumptions were to be revised or be rendered inaccurate  it could affect the overall profit recognized on these sales 
valuation of receivables 
receivables  including straight line rent receivables  are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and may be uncollectible in the future 
the company reviews its receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance to record against its receivables 
this review process requires management to make certain judgments regarding collectibility  notwithstanding the fact that ultimate collections are inherently difficult to predict 
a change in the judgments made could result in an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts with a corresponding effect on net income 
in addition  the market for the company s retail tenants has been very volatile in the company anticipates store closings  lease adjustments  bankruptcies and potentially other changes in the lease terms for certain tenants 
this future information  which previously has been difficult to predict  can change past judgments regarding collectibility 
accounting for non wholly owned entities the company holds ownership interests in a number of ventures with varying structures 
management evaluates all of its partnership interests and other variable interests to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity vie  as defined in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r fin r 
if the venture is a vie and if management determines that the company is the primary beneficiary  the company consolidates the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie 
the company has to reassess its conclusions as to whether the entity is a vie upon certain occurrences which are deemed reconsideration events under fin r 
for entities that are not determined to be vies  management evaluates whether or not the company has control or significant influence over the joint venture to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation 
entities under the company s control are consolidated and entities over which the company can exert significant influence  but does not control  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the company recognizes minority interest on its consolidated balance sheets for non wholly owned entities which the company consolidates 
the minority partner s share of current operations is reflected in minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of income 
contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures are recorded as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for income from unconsolidated joint ventures and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the company s balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets on the joint venture s balance sheet is amortized as an adjustment to income from unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset 
if the company s judgment as to the existence of a vie  the primary beneficiary of the vie  and the extent of influence and control over a non vie is incorrect  the presentation of the balance sheet and results of operations could be incorrect 
in addition  the conclusion on the accounting for the entity can change as reconsideration events occur 
as time passes from the formation of an entity  the expected results of the entity can vary  which could change the allocation to the partners 
the type of reconsideration event could adjust the conclusion previously determined for the accounting of the entity 
in  the real estate market has suffered declines  and this has resulted in changing economics at certain partnerships 
these changes were analyzed and there was no change in prior 
table of contents accounting treatment 
different accounting conclusions could be reached as time passes depending on the timing and extent of a market rebound  and certain ventures not previously consolidated could become consolidated entities 
discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements for non financial assets and liabilities 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  the company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company applied the following fair value hierarchy level assets or liabilities for which the identical item is traded on an active exchange  such as publicly traded instruments or futures contracts 
level assets and liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments 
level assets or liabilities for which significant valuation assumptions are not readily observable in the market  instruments valued based on the best available data  some of which is internally developed  and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require 
when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at and or marked to fair value  the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
when possible  the company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities 
when identical assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets  the company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities 
nevertheless  certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets and the company must use alternative valuation techniques to derive a fair value measurement 
the company applied the provisions of sfas no 
in recording its interest rate swap and disclosing its notes payable at fair value level  discussed further in note and in disclosing the fair value of its notes receivable level  discussed further in note 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which amended sfas no 
 and is effective for business combinations that close after january  the company anticipates that sfas no 
r could materially affect the allocation of components of assets in future acquisitions and will require the expensing of certain closing costs  however  the effect on the company cannot be currently quantified 
the company consolidates various ventures that are involved in the ownership and or development of real estate and records the other partner s interest as a minority interest 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which will result in amounts formerly reflected as minority interests to be classified as noncontrolling interests  in addition to different accounting requirements for these interests 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  during  certain revisions were also made to emerging issues task force eitf d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities  which clarified that certain minority interests with redemption provisions which are outside the company s control  commonly referred to as redeemable minority interests  were within the scope of eitf d certain venture agreements contain provisions which require the company to purchase the minority partner s interest at fair value  upon demand on or after a future date 
the company estimated the maximum redemption value of these interests at december  and disclosed such on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 and in conjunction with the requirements of eitf d  an adjustment for the fair value of redeemable minority interests will be required 
this adjustment will ultimately increase the carrying value of redeemable minority interests to the redemption value with a corresponding charge to equity 
under eitf d  the company will have a choice of either accreting redeemable minority interest to its redemption value over the redemption period or recognizing changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur 
the company anticipates utilizing the second approach and estimates the amount which will be recorded effective january  in equity will be approximately million 

table of contents results of operations for the three years ended december  general 
the company s financial results have been significantly affected by sale transactions and the fees generated by  and start up operations of  major real estate developments 
these types of transactions and developments do not necessarily recur 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements may not be indicative of future operating results

fee income 
fee income is comprised of management fees  development fees and leasing fees  which the company performs for joint ventures in which it has an ownership interest and third party property owners 
these amounts vary by years  due to the number of contracts with ventures and third party owners and the development and leasing needs at the underlying properties 
amounts are expected to continue to vary in future years based on volume and composition of activities at the underlying properties 
fee income increased million between and the increase in fee income between years is primarily the result of the receipt of a million development fee in the third quarter of this fee was earned on a contract the company assumed in an acquisition of an entity several years ago 
pursuant to the contract  
table of contents the company shares in the proceeds over cost from the sale of a building that the prior entity developed in texas 
this building was sold in the third quarter for cash and a note from the buyer 
the fee recognized represents the company s share of the cash proceeds 
as the buyer makes payments on the note  the company will share in these payments and anticipates recognizing additional fee income in future periods 
partially offsetting the increase was a decrease of  in development fees related to amounts the company paid and was reimbursed on behalf of the ft 
gillem contract 
the company recognized these fees in and none in  as this contract was assumed by weeks robinson when the company exited the industrial development business 
also partially offsetting the increase was a decrease of million in leasing fees earned in due to changes in the level of rollover and activity at the underlying properties for which the company performs leasing services 
management fees  including expense reimbursements  fluctuate as contracts are gained and lost  and did not change significantly between and fee income did not change significantly between and multi family residential sales and cost of sales and impairment loss 
in  the company substantially completed construction and closed the sales of units at its terminus place multi family residential project in atlanta  georgia 
all of these sales were recognized using the completed contract method as outlined in sfas no 
this caused the increase in sales and cost of sales between and given the current state of the multi family residential market in atlanta  the company cannot predict with certainty the timing of closing or pricing for the remaining units at terminus place 
while management believes that the terminus place units are well positioned from a pricing and quality standpoint  many factors  including the ability of buyers to obtain financing on favorable terms  will affect the remaining unit sales 
the company reviewed terminus place in the fourth quarter of  when construction was substantially complete  for impairment indicators 
management determined that impairment indicators were present 
this resulted in the company recording an impairment loss of million  which adjusted the cost basis of terminus place to fair value 
in  the company recognized sales and cost of sales at its juniper condominium project in midtown atlanta  georgia 
all of the units remaining in that project closed in  which caused the decrease in sales and cost of sales between and revenue and cost of sales were recognized using the percentage of completion method as outlined in sfas no 
for certain units which qualified  while other units were accounted for on the completed contract method 
residential lot and outparcel sales and cost of sales 
residential lot and outparcel sales decreased million between and and decreased million between and residential lot and outparcel cost of sales decreased million between and and million between and  which is due partially to volume of sales and partially to fluctuations in gross profit percentages used to calculate the cost of sales for residential lot sales in certain of the residential developments 
residential lot sales and cost of sales the company s residential lot business consists of projects that are consolidated  for which income is recorded in the residential lot and outparcel sales and cost of sales line items  and projects that are owned through joint ventures in which the company is a partner with temco and cl realty  for which income is recorded in the income from unconsolidated joint ventures line item 
lot sales were as follows consolidated projects temco cl realty total demand for residential lots is down significantly as a result of general market conditions and as a result of limited demand in the company s and its ventures principal markets in texas  florida and metropolitan atlanta 
builders  the primary customers for such residential lots  have a general oversupply of inventory in the company s markets and are working to reduce inventory levels before they consider buying additional lots 
in addition  many home builders are experiencing serious financial difficulties in the current economic environment  and the recent changes in credit availability for home buyers and homebuilders have made it more difficult to obtain financing for purchasers 
management is closely monitoring market developments but is currently unable to predict when markets will improve 
management expects these market conditions to continue to negatively impact residential lot 
table of contents sales and have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations until such time as the residential lot markets improve 
therefore  consistent with current market trends  the company anticipates residential lot sales for and potentially beyond  like those for  will be lower than those the company experienced in and  both at consolidated projects and at temco and cl realty 
despite the economic downturn in the residential lot business  the company recorded no impairment charges in its consolidated projects in on a quarterly basis  the company analyzes its consolidated land and lot holdings in accordance with sfas no 
by reviewing these assets for indicators of impairment 
if there are indicators of impairment  the company analyzes the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by assets as it considers substantially all of these assets to be held for use under sfas no 
the company also analyzes its investment in cl realty and temco in accordance with apb no 
to determine whether an impairment exists and  if so  whether such impairment is deemed to be temporary or other than temporary 
in addition  the company is exposed to its share of any impairment charge on any individual asset at cl realty and temco 
an impairment was recognized at a residential project in cl realty in  the effect of which was  for the company 
given the continuing uncertainty in the residential market  there can be no guarantee that the company will not record an impairment charge pursuant to sfas no 
or apb no 
in the future 
outparcel sales and cost of sales outparcel sales increased million between and and decreased million between and outparcel cost of sales increased  between and and decreased million between and there were three outparcel sales in  two in and four in interest and other income interest and other decreased million between and due to a decrease in termination fees of million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest income of million due to an increase in notes receivable outstanding and an increase in other income of approximately million mainly due to the sale of certain miscellaneous assets 
interest and other increased million between and  due to an increase in termination fees of million between those periods 
general and administrative expenses  including reimbursed

table of contents windy ridge parkway north point ground leases parcels frost bank tower the avenue of the peninsula north point ground leases parcels funds from operations 
the table below shows funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and the related reconciliation to net income available to common stockholders for the company 
the company calculated ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition  which is net income available to common stockholders computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding extraordinary items  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and gains or losses from sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the company presented the nareit defined calculation and also presented an adjusted nareit defined calculation of ffo to add back the losses on extinguishment of debt recognized in in connection with the venture formation in june with prudential and the sale of bank of america plaza in september the company presented this additional measure of ffo because the losses on extinguishment of debt that the company recognized related to a sale or an exchange of depreciable real estate  and all other amounts related to a sale or an exchange of depreciable real estate are excluded from ffo 
ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental measure of an equity reit s operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
company management evaluates operating performance in part based on ffo 
additionally  the company uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to its officers and key employees

general 
the company s financing strategy is to fund its development activities with proceeds from bank credit facilities  construction and permanent loans secured by its properties  sales of mature assets  contribution of assets to joint ventures  and the issuance of preferred stock 
the tightening of the credit markets  combined with the overall economic downturn in has made obtaining all forms of these sources of capital more difficult 
management believes that these adverse capital raising conditions will continue in and is not able to predict when the market will become more favorable from a capital raising standpoint 
the company has low debt maturities within the next year and is  therefore  not dependent upon the capital markets to refinance maturing obligations in the near future 
the conditions that have led to the tightening credit markets have also led to a decline in new development opportunities for the company 
therefore  while the sources of funds have become limited  the company s capital needs have also decreased 
in  the company commenced no new development projects  and as a result  funds used for development related activities  including contributions to joint ventures  decreased from million in to million in with limited development activity anticipated in  management believes that the company will be able to fund commitments on its remaining development projects with cash on hand and with available capacity under its credit facility

also  in  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million each in order to manage interest rate risk associated with floating rate  libor based borrowings 
these swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and effectively fix a portion of the underlying libor rate on company borrowings one at and the other at through october the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements at december  were liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively  which are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and ocl on the consolidated balance sheet 
from time to time  the company enters into interest rate swaps to effectively manage its interest rate risk on certain variable debt instruments 
payments made or received under the interest rate swap agreements are recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statements of income 
the company has not been utilizing the shortcut method of accounting for these instruments and follows the hypothetical derivative method as outlined in the derivative implementation group s no

in and  there was no ineffectiveness under any of the company s interest rate swaps 
the real estate and other assets of the acs center are restricted under the acs center loan agreement in that they are not available to settle debts of the company

in addition  under the terms of the san jose marketcenter mortgage note payable  the wholly owned subsidiary which owns that center cannot guarantee the debt of any other entity  including the company 
future capital requirements over the long term  management expects the economy and credit markets to recover to the point that the company will be able to actively manage its portfolio of income producing properties and strategically sell assets to capture value for stockholders and to recycle capital for future development activities 
the company expects to continue to utilize indebtedness to fund future commitments and expects to place long term permanent mortgages on selected assets as well as utilize construction facilities for other development assets 
the company may enter into additional joint venture arrangements to help fund future developments and may enter into additional structured transactions with third parties 
management will continue to evaluate all public equity sources  including the issuance of common and preferred stock and select the most appropriate options as capital is required 
the company anticipates filing a shelf registration statement in the near term to register securities available for issuance 
the company s business model is highly dependent upon raising capital to meet development obligations 
if one or more sources of capital are not available when required  the company may be forced to raise capital on potentially unfavorable terms or not pursue development projects that may otherwise be profitable  either of which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

cash flows from operations for were also positively impacted by the receipt of million in income tax refunds 
in addition  the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was million higher in  because the company elected to pay certain bonuses earned in in early  which was a change in timing relative to prior years 
offsetting this was a million decrease related to a reduction in prepaid rents received at the end of compared to and to a decrease in accounts payable due to timing of vendor payments  which caused the overall decline in change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash flows provided by operating activities decreased million between and the primary reason for the decrease was lower cash flows from certain properties which were sold or contributed to ventures in these decreases were partially offset by cash flows from the acquisition of peachtree tower and the sale of land adjacent to the avenue carriage crossing

additionally  cash flows from financing activities decreased due to the repurchase of million in preferred stock in  with no preferred stock repurchases in this decrease is partially offset by an increase in net borrowings of million on the company s credit facility to fund development projects and the company s cash reserves

other matters 
the events of september  adversely affected the pricing and availability of property insurance 
in particular  premiums increased and terrorism insurance coverage became harder to obtain 
the availability of coverage has improved and  at this time  management believes that the company and its unconsolidated joint ventures are adequately insured on all of their assets 
while the company s cost of property insurance coverage has increased  management believes the costs are currently reasonable and should not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations in there can be no assurance that this situation will continue beyond off balance sheet arrangements 
the company has a number of off balance sheet joint ventures with varying structures  as described in note in the accompanying financial statements 
at december   the company s unconsolidated joint ventures had aggregate outstanding indebtedness to third parties of approximately million of which the company s share was million 
these loans are generally mortgage or construction loans most of which are non recourse to the company 
in certain instances  the company provides non recourse carve out guarantees on these non recourse loans 
the unconsolidated joint ventures also had performance bonds which the company guarantees totaling approximately million at december  cf murfreesboro associates cf murfreesboro  one of the ventures in which the company has an interest  constructed and owns a retail center

however  the current credit markets are constrained and management cannot anticipate whether and on what basis the level of property financing will be available in in addition  the company has a repayment guarantee million that reduces to million if certain leasing and financial performance criteria are met 
the criteria have not been met as of december  at december   the company had a liability of  recorded related to this guarantee 
another venture in which the company has an interest  terminus llc t  is developing and intends to operate an office building  along with ancillary retail and commercial space  in the terminus project in atlanta  georgia

at december   the company had a liability  recorded related to this guarantee 
the company also has a completion guarantee under the loan  for which the liability was estimated to be nominal 
in addition  the company is required to fund construction costs of t for amounts over certain limits  which it has determined is not probable  and the fair value of this guarantee is nominal 
a third venture in which the company has an interest  glenmore garden villas  llc glenmore  was also formed in to develop a townhome project in charlotte  north carolina 
glenmore entered into two notes with a maximum available of million 
each of the two partners in glenmore guarantee of the payment of principal and interest on the loans described above  which totals a maximum liability to each partner of million

several of the remaining joint ventures in which the company has an interest are involved in the active acquisition and development of real estate 
as capital is required to fund the acquisition and development of this real estate  the company intends to fund its share of the costs not funded by operations or outside financing 
in addition  the company may be required to fund operations for a limited period of time 
based on the nature of the activities conducted in these ventures  management cannot estimate with any degree of accuracy amounts that the company may be required to fund in the short or long term

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company has both fixed and variable rate debt 
the fixed rate debt obligations limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates  and generally are mortgage loans secured by certain of the company s real estate assets 
the company is exposed to risk as these mortgages mature  and the company seeks replacement mortgages 
there has been significant tightening in the availability of credit in the market  and it is not known at this point when or if the market will change 
however  the company does not have a significant level of mortgage debt maturing in in  the company has two mortgage notes maturing  however  the more significant consolidated mortgage debt maturing in  san jose marketcenter  has an option to extend its maturity for one year  under certain circumstances 
therefore  the company has determined that it does not have significant exposure at this time due to the fluctuating and difficult credit market related to its existing mortgage notes 
at december   the company had million of fixed rate debt outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of compared to million outstanding at a rate of at december  the company believes the average interest rate on its fixed rate mortgage debt is less than current market rates 
in addition  the company believes that the loan to value ratio that it has received in previous debt arrangements is higher than what the company would be able to obtain in today s marketplace  and  therefore  it would receive a lower loan amount for a similar type property mortgage loan 
in addition  lenders have been resistant in the current market in some situations to offer mortgage financing at all  and therefore  the company could have exposure in finding lenders willing to enter into new mortgage financings 
as of december   the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding at a weighted average interest rate  using variable rates in effect today and the current spread on the facility  adjusted for interest 
table of contents rate swaps in effect  of compared to million outstanding at a rate of at december  the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes through its variable rate credit and term facilities 
the company has mitigated a portion of its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps 
in  the company mitigated its interest rate risk under its term facility by entering into an interest rate swap to fix this facility s base rate of libor at 
in  the company entered into two million interest rate swaps against its floating rate  libor based borrowings at and 
all of these swaps are with bank of america 
the company believes it has counterparty risk under these swaps  but such amount is limited 
libor decreased significantly between december  and december  the company estimates that the interest rates under current market conditions would be higher if it were to enter into similar financial instruments in today s market than the rates obtained on facilities closed in recent years 
most of the company s variable rate debt pays a spread above a reference rate  which is typically libor  which spread is calculated based on certain ratios detailed in the agreement 
the company believes the spread that it would incur above a variable reference rate would be higher if it entered into similar variable facilities in today s market than the spreads the company is required to pay under the current facilities 
the company also may not obtain the same level of amounts available under such facilities 
based on the company s average variable rate debt balances during  interest expense  before capitalization to projects under development  would have increased by approximately million in if libor interest rates had been higher and if the company did not have any interest rate swaps fixing its interest rate on certain instruments 
the following table summarizes the company s market risk associated with notes payable as of december  it includes the principal amounts of the expected annual maturities  weighted average interest rates on those principal maturities and the fair values of the company s fixed and variable rate notes payable 
fair value was calculated by discounting future principal payments at estimated rates at which similar loans would have been obtained at december  the information presented below should be read in conjunction with note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the company did not have a significant level of notes receivable at december   and the table does not include information related to notes receivable 
expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in thousands notes payable fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rates on variable rate notes payable are equal to the variable rates in effect as of december   plus the applicable spread
