executive overview nautilus is a global fitness products company providing innovative  quality solutions to help people achieve a fit and healthy lifestyle 
we are a leading designer  developer  manufacturer and marketer of fitness products sold around the world 
we believe our brands are some of the strongest in the industry 
we market our products through three business segments direct  retail and commercial 
the direct segment offers products directly to consumers through direct advertising  catalogs and the internet 
our retail segment offers our products through a network of over  retail locations 
our commercial segment offers products to health clubs  schools  hospitals and other organizations  which typically require unique strength and cardio products designed for higher usage 
we believe that a segment approach to our business allows us to hold each business unit manager accountable for the operations and results of their respective areas 
each business segment is focused on improving shareholder returns with a particular emphasis on profitability and capital productivity 

table of contents we adopted the business segment model as part of a reorganization program implemented in the second quarter of although our reorganization plan has not been entirely implemented  and in spite of the present challenging economic environment  we are seeing benefits from our efforts  particularly in terms of reduced operating expenses 
during  we made a number of strategic decisions which impacted our operating results we restructured our workforce to better match the requirements of the newly formed business segment organization  we closed our tulsa commercial manufacturing facility and transferred operations to third party manufacturers in asia and our owned manufacturing facility in independence  virginia  we consolidated our us distribution centers and aligned the products by segment to allow for more efficient product handling  we ceased direct business sales through our australian subsidiary and closed those operations  we sold our apparel division  dash america  inc d b a pearl izumi  we closed our canadian call center and consolidated our call center operations in vancouver  washington to achieve better economies of scale  we terminated a number of marketing arrangements to better align our spending with our revised operating plans  we reduced our revolving line of credit to a level better suited for our anticipated borrowing  and we exercised our right to terminate agreements to purchase the land america manufacturing facility located in china 
global market and economic conditions have been  and continue to be  disruptive and volatile  and in recent months the volatility has reached unprecedented levels 
concerns about the systemic impact of geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  currency volatility  slowing global economies  the united states mortgage market and a decline in the real estate market in the us and elsewhere have contributed to diminished expectations for the us and world economies 
these conditions  including declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have contributed to reductions in consumer spending  particularly on discretionary products such as ours 
during  we implemented cost reduction efforts to adjust for the decline in revenue  however  our restructuring and cost reduction efforts could only partially offset the financial impact of the aforementioned factors on our revenue 
we will continue to move forward with our restructuring and cost reduction strategies 
it is uncertain as to when the economy will recover  and it is not clear that our restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives will sufficiently offset the impact of the poor economic environment on our net sales 
current economic conditions have led to greater than anticipated losses from operations  which have caused us to encounter difficulty in maintaining the covenants under our revolving credit facility 
although we have been able to obtain waivers in the past  which have allowed us to exclude certain items from the covenant calculations  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain waivers in the future 
as a result of these challenges  we sustained significant operating losses during and  contributing to a decrease in cash and net working capital  and have had to rely on financing to fund our operations 
if we continue to experience significant operating losses and reductions in net working capital  we will need to obtain additional debt or equity financing to continue operating 
if we are not able to raise needed capital  we would be forced to sharply curtail our operations  including efforts to develop  manufacture and promote the sale of products 

table of contents overview substantially all of our revenues are generated from product sales 
our net sales for the year ended december   totaled million  a decline of compared to the million reported for the year ended december  the decline in net sales is primarily due to a weak consumer environment and tight credit market 
gross profit margins increased  to in  compared to in we have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives during and implemented sales price increases in all segments 
the impact of these efforts were substantially offset by an decline in total sales and a change in sales mix resulting in a decline in direct segment revenue 
gross profit for was reduced by charges of million for discontinued inventory  million for severance and million for costs incurred with closing the tulsa manufacturing facility 
gross profit for was reduced by the impact of million in discontinued inventory and warranty costs related to specialized cardio product sold in the commercial segment that was not meeting durability requirements and led to curtailment of shipments in most countries 
the direct segment is generally our highest margin business 
our operating expenses have declined due to our aforementioned restructuring efforts and profitability initiatives implemented in late and early such initiatives included reorganizing and reducing our workforce  combining our us and canadian call center  closing the direct business in australia  and the termination of a number of marketing arrangements 
operating expenses for totaled million  compared to million reported in operating expenses for included  million in goodwill impairment charges and million in other intangibles impairment charges  million in restructuring charges  million in write downs associated with assets owned by a subsidiary in china  million in bad debt expense  million write down of previously deferred financing costs as a result of amending our loan agreement  million in legal and contract settlement costs  million in reimbursement obligations for costs incurred by sherborne investors in a shareholder action to obtain representation on our board of directors 
operating expenses for included an million benefit associated with a favorable legal settlement with icon health and fitness  million in restructuring charges  a million bad debt expense due to the bankruptcy of a customer  and million in costs incurred by the company in countering the action of sherborne investors 
the reduction in operating expenses  compared to the prior year  is a result of management s efforts to better align operating expenses with current and anticipated revenue levels through significant reductions in media expenses  personnel costs and other discretionary expenses 
we will continue to focus on reducing our operating expenses in the coming months as we move forward with our turnaround strategy 
in addition  we anticipate recognizing additional restructuring expenses of approximately million through the second quarter of related primarily to severance costs  real estate lease terminations and write off of leasehold improvements 
results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 

table of contents management and our independent auditors regularly discuss with the audit committee of our board of directors  each of our critical accounting policies and estimates  including the underlying assumptions and related disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  located at item of this form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  title and risk of loss have passed and there are no significant remaining performance obligations 
title generally passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer  depending on the country of the sale and the specific terms of the sales arrangement 
revenues for products sold to our direct and retail customers are recognized at the time of shipment 
revenue is recognized for commercial product sales based on the specific terms of the arrangement 
if the arrangement requires us to deliver and install the commercial products  we record revenue upon delivery and installation  which generally occur in tandem 
if the arrangement calls for a third party to deliver and install the products  revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product to a common carrier  as title and risk of loss has passed to the buyer 
installation revenue and expenses are not material to our results of operations 
we record taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis  excluded from revenue 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded gross  meaning they are included in both revenue and cost of sales 
many of our direct segment customers finance their purchases through a third party entity  and we pay a commission  or customer financing fee  to the financing entity pursuant to our merchant contract with the entity 
we record sales for these transactions based on the sales prices charged to our customers and record the commission or financing fee as a component of selling and marketing expense 
revenue is recognized net of applicable sales incentives  such as promotional discounts  rebates and return allowances 
we estimate the revenue impact of our incentive programs based on the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if the amount of our sales incentives can be reasonably estimated  we record the impact of such incentives at the later of  the time we notify our customer of the sales incentive  or the time of the sale 
if the amount of our sales incentives can not be reasonably estimated  due to lack of historical data or other factors  we defer revenue recognition until the earlier of i receipt of payment under the contract or ii such time as we are able to arrive at a reasonable estimate of the amount of the incentive 
we estimate our liability for product returns based on historical experience and record the expected obligation as a reduction in revenue 
if actual return costs differ from our estimates  the recorded amount of the liability and corresponding revenue are adjusted 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation we evaluate our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired 
our judgments regarding potential impairment are based on a number of factors including the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows  market conditions  relative levels of risk  the cost of capital  terminal values  royalty rates  and the allocation of revenues  expenses and assets and liabilities to business segments 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and  thereby  could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
events could cause us to conclude that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired 
due to a challenging economy and reductions in and revenues  in the fourth quarter of we recognized a million impairment loss on goodwill associated with our retail business and a million impairment in other intangibles charges related to our stairmaster trade name 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment loss of million related to the rights to certain intangible assets acquired in a legal settlement with icon health and fitness 
the goodwill impairment is reported in a separate line in our consolidated statement of operations  and the other intangibles impairments are recorded as components of general and administrative and restructuring expenses 

table of contents accounts receivable valuation we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including an aging of receivable balances  historical collection experience  our understanding of the current financial status of key customers and overall economic conditions 
we periodically review the credit worthiness of our customers to help gauge collectibility and increase our allowance for doubtful accounts when collection is at risk 
we believe that by analyzing historical trends and monitoring potential collection problems  we have sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate of the portion of our receivable balances that will not be collected 
however  since we cannot predict  with certainty  future changes in the financial stability of our customers or in the general economy  our actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
our ability to collect the amounts due from our customers could be impacted by various factors including a deterioration in the financial condition of a key customer  inability of customers to obtain bank credit lines  a significant slow down in the economy  our efforts to pursue collections  product quality matters or other customer disputes 
even though portions of our accounts receivable are protected by a security interest in products held by customers  any of the factors noted above may affect our ability to collect all  or a portion of  our receivable balances and could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inventory valuation our inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined based on the first in  first out method 
any abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges 
further  any unallocated overhead remaining after the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory  based on the normal capacity of the production facilities  are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
we establish provisions for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory based on inventory levels  expected product life and forecasted sales demand 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventory values  we are required to make judgments regarding the salability of our products  including an assessment of future demand compared with existing inventory levels  competitive factors  and changes in technology and product life cycles 
a significant change in any of the aforementioned factors could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
it is also possible that an increase in our inventory provisions may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for our products and we do not adjust our production activities or our purchases from third party contract manufacturers accordingly 
product warranties the company s products carry limited defined warranties for defects in materials or workmanship 
our warranties generally obligate us to pay for the costs to manufacture or purchase warranty parts  ship the parts to our customers  and  in certain instances  service costs to replace the warranty part 
we record a liability  at the time of sale  for the estimated costs of responding to future warranty claims 
the liability is recorded as a component of cost of sales and is estimated based on historical warranty claim experience and available product quality data 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
warranty expenses are affected by the performance of new products  significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to the customer  product failure rates  and higher or lower than expected repair costs 
if estimated costs differ from actual warranty costs incurred  or if circumstances change such that the assumptions inherent in our previous estimates are no longer valid  we adjust our warranty reserve accordingly 
our estimates of warranty expenses are based on significant judgment  and the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation for the reasons noted above 
changes in the aforementioned factors or other warranty related assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation on a straight line basis  over the applicable vesting period  based on the grant date fair value of our awards 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes merton option valuation model and determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards based on the closing market price on the day preceding the grant 

table of contents estimating the fair value of our stock based awards involves inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
the valuation of our stock options requires us to make assumptions regarding the expected term of our options  expected future volatility in the market price of our common stock  future risk free interest rates and future dividends  if any  expected to be approved by our board of directors 
we estimate future forfeitures  at the time of grant and in subsequent periods  based on historical experience  and recognize compensation expense for only those awards that are expected to vest 
we reevaluate our estimate of forfeitures each quarter and  if applicable  recognize a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of the change if the revised estimate of forfeitures differs significantly from the previous estimate 
to the extent a stock based award is subject to performance conditions  the amount of expense we record in a given period  if any  may fluctuate depending upon our assessment of the probability of achieving the performance targets 
our stock based compensation expense may also change  over time  as we review and adjust our compensation practices 
if factors  such as those discussed above  were to change  and we used different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense in the future could be materially different from that reported in previous periods 
litigation and loss contingencies from time to time  we may be involved in claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
such matters involve uncertainty as to the eventual outcomes and any losses we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
we record expenses for litigation and loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company estimates the probability of such losses based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcomes from similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative developments and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates accordingly 
a significant change in our estimates  or an outcome that differs from the assumptions incorporated in our estimates  may have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
income tax provisions we account for income taxes based on the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to be included  as income or expense  in the applicable tax return 
the effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized  in the period of the enactment 
we adopted the provisions of fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
significant judgments are required in determining tax provisions  evaluating tax positions and  when necessary  establishing or making adjustments to our valuation allowance 
such judgments require us to interpret existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our circumstances 
to the extent that it is more likely than not 
table of contents that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for that amount 
if the company s financial results or other relevant facts change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position  significant judgment would be applied in determining the effect of the change on our valuation allowance 
general our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period 
our revenues will fluctuate due to the seasonality of our industry  customer buying patterns  product innovation  the nature and level of competition for health and fitness products  our ability to manufacture or procure products to meet customer demand  and the level of spending on  and effectiveness of  our media and advertising programs 
in addition  our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors  including  among other things the overall condition of the us economy and economies of other countries where we market our products  and the availability of credit  both in the us and abroad 
our profit margins may vary  in response to the aforementioned factors and our ability to manage product costs and effectively utilize our manufacturing capacity 
profit margins may also be affected by fluctuations in the costs or availability of materials used to manufacture our products  higher or lower fuel prices  and changes in the cost of other distribution or manufacturing related services 
our operating profit or losses may also be affected by the relative success of strategies we employ to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization 
historically our operating expenses have been influenced by media costs to produce and air advertisements  facility costs  operating costs of our information and communications systems  costs to develop and maintain our internet sites  bad debts costs and personnel related costs to attract and retain key personnel 
in addition  our operating expenses have been impacted by asset impairment losses  restructuring charges and other significant unusual or infrequent expenses 
as a result of the above and other factors  our period to period operating results may not be indicative of future performance 
you should not place undue reliance on our operating results and should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties typically encountered by us and other companies  both within and outside our industry  in the current economic environment 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and  consequently  we cannot assure you of any future growth or profitability

income tax expense benefit the provision for income tax expense was a benefit of million during as compared to an expense of million in our effective tax rate was in  compared to in the increase in our annual effective rate was primarily due to the release of certain tax reserves in discontinued operations the company designated the financial results of the fitness apparel business as discontinued operations during this resulted in recording the financial results as income loss from discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations during was million  compared to income from discontinued operations of million during the prior year 
the loss from discontinued operations includes an impairment charge of million for the difference between the book value of the fitness apparel business net assets and the anticipated net sale proceeds 
liquidity and capital resources in  we generated million in cash from operating activities from continuing operations  compared to million in this improvement is primarily the result of favorable changes in working capital  principally a reduction in inventories and customer receivables 
the increase in operating cash flows also reflects the receipt of us federal income tax refunds during totaling million 
the company paid million in in connection with the settlement of all claims related to the termination of the land america agreements 

table of contents cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations in totaled million  compared to cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of million in the change primarily reflects the million payment to land america in for the terminated acquisition agreement 
in addition  during  we received the return of our million deposit related to the terminated land america agreement 
in  we received million representing full payment on a note receivable from a previous business partnership and million related to the sale of a building 
during  we received million from the sale of a building 
the company invested million in capital expenditures during  compared to million in the decrease reflects management s decision to reduce capital spending in response to a sluggish economy 
the company anticipates it will continue to operate at a reduced capital spending level for the foreseeable future 
in the second quarter of  we received million from the sale of our pearl izumi apparel business 
we reported the cash effect of this transaction as cash flows from investing activities from discontinued operations 
net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations totaled million in  compared to million in net cash provided from such activities in in  we made million in net payments to reduce our short term borrowings  principally using funds received from the sale of our apparel business in the second quarter  and paid million in financing fees  legal expenses and other costs to establish the revolving credit agreement 
during  we also used million to repurchase outstanding shares of the company s common stock based on a stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in may we do not anticipate any further repurchases under the repurchase program unless and until we return to sustained profitability 
cash used for financing activities from continuing operations in included million in dividend payments to our shareholders 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors suspended the quarterly dividend payment 
we do not anticipate further dividend payments in the foreseeable future due to the difficult economic environment 
the economy s impact on our operating results has been worse than we anticipated  and we are uncertain as to when the economy will stabilize or begin to improve 
over the last two years  we have initiated a series of restructuring activities  which have generated substantial charges contributing to significant operating losses and negative cash flows 
while the restructuring strategies we have implemented are expected to result in substantial cost savings in future periods  they have not been able to offset the full impact of the poor economic conditions and our decline in revenues 
as a result of these and other factors  we cannot presently project when or if we might become profitable 
our return to profitability is highly dependent on numerous factors  including increased consumer confidence  improved global economic conditions  particularly in the us  relaxed credit markets including improved availability of credit for our customers  and resumed growth in consumer spending on discretionary goods 
in light of the aforementioned uncertainties  there can be no assurance we will return to generating positive cash flows 
we anticipate receiving us federal income tax refunds totaling approximately million  in the second or third quarter of  and receiving the refund of a million escrow deposit  in the fourth quarter of  from the sale of our fitness apparel business 
we believe these sources of cash and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
financing arrangement the company relies on its current banking relationship to meet its ongoing cash needs  particularly during seasonal periods of reduced cash flow 
the company has a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with bank of america na  which provides the company with a revolving secured credit line to fund the company s letters of credit  working capital needs and for other general business purposes  including acquisition financing 
the company entered into a fifth amendment of the loan agreement  effective march   which reduced the amount of the credit line  from million  to million  and amended certain loan covenants 
the actual amount the company is able to borrow against the credit line is calculated as the lower of either million  or the borrowing capacity  which is based primarily on the month end value of 
table of contents inventory and accounts receivable in the us  as adjusted for certain items identified in the loan agreement 
at march   the company had unused availability of approximately million under the credit line 
the loan agreement contains a financial covenant  as well as limitations on capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  indebtedness  liens  dispositions  dividends  and investments 
the financial covenant is applicable only during a trigger period that would be in effect when excess availability based on the value of our collateral assets  in excess of current borrowings falls below certain pre established limits 
once activated  the trigger period would generally last until the company meets minimum excess borrowing capacity requirements for a day period 
the loan agreement also contains customary provisions regarding events of default 
upon an event of default  the lenders would have the option of accelerating all obligations under the loan agreement 
the company  as of this date  had not triggered the requirement to calculate compliance under the financial covenant provision of the loan agreement  but would have passed the financial covenant in the amended loan agreement if the covenant had been applied 
however  we cannot be assured that we will not enter into a trigger period in the future or that we will continue to remain in compliance with the loan covenants 
in the event of default or loan covenant violation  and should bank of america na elect to not enter into a forbearance agreement or waiver  the company s performance and current economic and financial conditions would make it difficult for us to obtain an alternative source of financing 
at december  the company had million in standby letters of credit and borrowings of million  and the unused borrowing capacity after applicable reserves was approximately million 
at march   the company had approximately million in standby letters of credit and other guarantees 
refer to note  in notes to consolidated financial statements  for further information regarding the loan agreement 
non cancelable contractual obligations our operating cash flows include the effect of certain non cancelable  contractual obligations 
a summary of our such obligations  as of december   is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum royalty obligations short term borrowings  excluding interest total included in the operating lease total is million of lease obligations related to facilities that are planned for closure during because the majority of our inventory is sourced from asia  we have long lead times for inventory purchases and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance 
as the result  all of the million in purchase obligations is for inventory purchases 
due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  approximately million in uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

table of contents contingencies arising from china sales operations in december  the company initiated discussions to suspend operations in its shanghai  china sales office and to discontinue the sale of products into the chinese market through the use of its own sales staff 
most of the employees in the sales office were terminated in the first quarter of efforts to directly sell products in china are not currently being made  and the company will take steps over the next several months to decide whether to serve customers through a down sized sales office or to use a distributor model 
the company s results of operations include approximately million in charges due to uncertainties regarding access to  and the future recovery of  certain assets of the company s china subsidiary 
off balance sheet arrangements at times  we become involved in third party lease and financing arrangements which assist our customers in obtaining funds to purchase our products 
while most of these financings are without recourse  in certain cases we may offer a guarantee or other recourse provisions 
our financing partner reviews consumer credit information in evaluating the risk of default prior to extending credit to our customers 
we rely on the quality of our partner s review and our own risk assessment in determining whether to proceed with a recourse transaction 
at december  and  the maximum contingent liability under all recourse provisions was approximately million and million  respectively 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this arrangement 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims 
these may include agreements with vendors and suppliers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services  agreements with customers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use or sale of our products  real estate and equipment leases  under which we may indemnify lessors against third party claims relating to the use of their property  agreements with licensees or licensors  under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property  and agreements with parties to debt arrangements  under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions 
the nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract  and generally a maximum obligation is not stated 
we hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain types of indemnifications 
because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation  and because management does not expect these obligations to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no liabilities are recorded at december  inflation and price changes we have experienced significant cost increases for products and components manufactured for us by third parties in china 
such increases are primarily attributable to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  increases in chinese wages  taxes and raw material costs  which our third party partners seek to pass along to us 
raw material costs have also increased for products manufactured in company owned facilities in the us these increases have had a negative impact on our gross margins for certain products 
changes in transportation costs  largely due to fluctuations in fuel prices  have at times also adversely affected our gross margins 
if these conditions persist  and the company is unable to find other cost savings or increase selling prices to sufficiently offset such cost increases  our gross margins may continue to be negatively impacted 
seasonality we expect our sales from fitness equipment products both in the us and internationally to vary seasonally 
sales are typically strongest in the fourth quarter  followed by the first and third quarters  and are generally weakest in the second quarter 
we believe that such factors as the broadcast of national network season finales 
table of contents and seasonal weather patterns influence television viewership and cause our television commercials on national cable television to be less effective in the second quarter than in other periods of the year 
in addition  during the spring and summer months  consumers tend to be involved in outdoor activities  including exercise  which impacts sales of fitness equipment used indoors 
this seasonality can have a significant affect on our inventory levels  working capital needs and the utilization of resources in our manufacturing and warehousing locations 
new accounting pronouncements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements located at item of this form k for information concerning the actual or anticipated impact of new accounting pronouncements on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from currency fluctuations  mainly in canada  china and europe  due to sourcing of our products in us dollars and selling them primarily in canadian dollars  chinese renminbi  british pounds  swiss francs and euros in addition to us dollars 
given the relative size of our current foreign operations  the exposure to the exchange risk could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
based on our assets and liabilities denominated in other than us dollars at december   a ten percent change in all european currencies would result in a change in our net foreign position totaling approximately million 
a ten percent change in either the canadian dollar or chinese renminbi would not have a significant impact on our net foreign position 
we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our variable rate credit agreement with bank of america  na as of december   our outstanding borrowings under this credit facility totaled million
