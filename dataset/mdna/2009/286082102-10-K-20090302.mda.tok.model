overview key financial results for were as follows our consolidated revenues decreased by approximately  or million  from million in to million for the year ended december  this was due primarily to the controllers product revenues  which contributed million of the decrease in gross margins decreased to in versus in due to a greater percentage of inkjet products sales which have lower gross margins than our apps and controller products 
operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased from in to in primarily due to impairment charges recorded on goodwill and certain long lived assets as a result of the impairment analysis conducted during the fourth quarter  in process research development write off charges related to our acquisition of pace and rastek  and increased restructuring and other costs as a result of headcount reductions and facility closures during the year 
had these costs not be included in operating expenses  our total operating expenses for would have been of revenues  which approximates prior year total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
interest and other income decreased from of revenue in to of revenue in driven by lower interest income on our investments on lower investment balances and interest rates 
we sold a substantial portion of our investment portfolio during the first five months of in order to generate cash for the redemption of our convertible senior debentures  which occurred on june  in  we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million on pretax loss of million and  in  we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million on pretax income of million 
the change from to primarily related to a pre tax loss of million incurred in 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for  and these operating results are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
years ended december  revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring and other amortization of identified intangibles in process research and development goodwill and asset impairment total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes net income loss revenue we currently classify our revenue into three categories 
the first category  controllers  includes products and technology which connect digital copiers with computer networks  and is made up of stand alone controllers and embedded desktop controllers  bundled solutions and design licensed solutions primarily for the office market and commercial printing 
this category includes our fiery series external print servers and embedded servers  splash and micropress  color and black and white server products  software options for fiery products and parts 
it also includes server related revenue comprised of scanning solutions 
the second category  inkjet products  consists of sales of the super wide and wide format inkjet printers  industrial inkjet printers  inks  and parts and services revenue from the vutek  jetrion  and rastek businesses 
the third category  advanced professional print software  or apps  consists of software technology focused on printing workflow  print management information systems pmis  proofing and e commerce and job tracking tools 
apps also consists of revenue from the pace business in pmis and e commerce solutions 
our revenues by product category for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands years ended december  change revenue over over controllers inkjet products advanced professional printing software total revenue 
table of contents revenues in controllers and apps categories for the twelve months ended december  and december  have been revised to reflect the reclassification of controller related software revenue from the apps category to the controllers category 
total revenue from the twelve months ended december  and december  have not changed 
overview revenue was million in  compared to million in and million in resulting in a decrease in versus and a increase in versus the million decrease in compared to was primarily due to a million decrease in controllers revenues and a million decrease in inkjet product revenues  offset by a slight increase of million in apps revenues 
controllers revenues in our controllers category  revenue declined by million or in versus  which was primarily driven by reduced demand from our oem customers throughout the world due to a slowing global economy 
the tightening of global credit markets also contributed to the decline as it has become relatively more difficult for some of our customers to obtain financing 
inkjet products revenues inkjet product revenues were million in as compared to million in the year over year decline of million or was primarily due to substantially lower printer volume in the fourth quarter of  as year over year revenues in the fourth quarter of versus decreased by million or in total 
it has become relatively more difficult for customers to obtain financing to purchase our products due to the tightening of global credit markets 
in addition  the softening of the retail sector and the related demand for signs  billboards and point of purchase displays has impacted our customers businesses and their demand for ink  which resulted in a lower demand for our ink products in the fourth quarter of inkjet product revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase is due to the continued sales of vutek s qs series of uv printers  driven by demand in europe  middle east and africa emea and the americas 
advanced professional print software revenues revenue in the advanced professional print software category increased by million or in over  primarily due to the strong sales of our pmis products and partially due to the acquisition of pace during the third quarter of which strengthened our pmis products 
the apps category increased in over primarily due to the strength of our suite of products 
this category includes our management systems software  including hagen  pace  psi  logic  printsmith and printflow  our web based order entry and order management software  including digital storefront printersite suite  and our proofing software  including colorproof xf and resale of products from third party suppliers such as xmpie software and manhattan associates software among others 
the software applications in this category generate higher margins  favorably impacting our margins 
in  we re organized our pmis product lines after the acquisition of pace in order to better leverage our investment in this segment and concentrate our resources on fewer products 
as a result  we are no longer selling psi and logic to new customers and have reduced our investment in the development of these products 
we currently sell printsmith to small print for pay and small commercial print shops  pace to medium and large commercial printers  wide format and digital printers  and monarch to large commercial printers  publication printers  and digital printers 

table of contents revenues by geographic area for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  change over over americas emea japan other international locations total revenue revenue declined in across all regions primarily driven by our controllers products 
in the individual regions  controllers product revenues in represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan and other international locations  respectively 
in  revenues in the americas  emea  and japan regions represented  and of revenues  respectively  with no change from revenue growth in across all regions was primarily driven by our inkjet products 
shipments to some of our us oem customers are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations  which in turn ship to other locations  making it more difficult to obtain accurate geographical shipment data 
accordingly  we believe that export sales of our products into each region may differ from what is reported 
we expect that sales outside of the united states will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
a substantial portion of our revenue over the years has been attributable to sales of products through our oem customers and independent distributor channels 
for the year ended december   two customers canon and xerox each provided more than of our revenue individually and approximately of revenue in the aggregate 
for the year ended december   two customers canon and xerox each provided more than of our revenue individually and approximately of revenue in the aggregate 
for the year ended december   canon and xerox each provided more than of our revenue individually and approximately of revenue in the aggregate 
we have shown decreasing dependency on the oem business although in  of our revenues were from non oem sources 
in and  and respectively of our business was from non oem sources 
we do not expect a decrease in oem revenue in as a percentage of total revenue  but over time we do expect the oem percentage to decline 
the decreasing reliance on major oem partners is attributable to the increasing percentage of revenue derived from the inkjet products business and apps business where most of the revenue is generated from sales to distributors and direct customers 
no assurance can be given that our relationships with distributors and direct customers will continue or that we will be successful in maintaining or increasing the number of our oem customers or the size of our existing oem relationships 
several of our oem customers have reduced their purchases from us at various times in the past and any customer could do so in the future as there are no contractual obligations by most of our oems to purchase our products at all  or in significant amounts 
such reductions have occurred in the past and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we expect that if we increase our revenues from our inkjet products and our professional printing applications  the percentage of our revenue that comes from individual oems will continue to decrease further 
we intend to continue to develop new products and technologies for each of our product lines including new generations of controllers and controller products and other new product lines and to distribute those new 
table of contents products to or through current and new oem customers  distribution partners  and end users in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of current or future products will be successful 
to the extent that sales of our products do not grow over time in absolute terms  or if we are not able to meet demand for higher unit volumes  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
there can be no assurance that any products that we introduce in the future will successfully compete  be accepted by the market  or otherwise effectively replace the volume of revenue and or income from our older products 
market acceptance of our software products  products acquired through acquisitions and other products cannot be assured 
we also believe that in addition to the factors described above  price reductions for all of our products may affect revenues in the future 
we have previously reduced and in the future will likely reduce prices for our products 
depending upon the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products  and other economic and competitive conditions  such price reductions have had and may in the future have an adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expenses were million  million  and million respectively for the years ended december    and the year over year increase of million or from to was primarily due to the absence of equity award issuances for the first months of as a result of the stock options investigation conducted at that time 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for more discussion of stock based compensation 
gross margins our gross margins were   and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margins in and was primarily due to the greater mix of inkjet sales 
our inkjet printers have a lower gross margin than our controllers and apps product lines 
product mix is a significant driver in our gross margins and we cannot predict the impact that product mix will have on future gross margin results 
our inkjet product line is growing as a percentage of revenue which decreases gross margin percentage 
for inkjet revenues were of total revenue as compared to and of total revenues in and  respectively 
gross margins on our inkjet products are lower than gross margins on our controllers business 
our ink sales represent a continuing revenue stream to existing customers that will increase if our inkjet customers production increases 
ink margins are typically higher than overall inkjet margins 
if our product mix changes significantly  our gross margins will fluctuate 
in addition  gross margins can be impacted by a variety of other factors 
these factors include the market prices that can be achieved on our current and future products  the availability and pricing of key components including dram  processors  and print heads  third party manufacturing costs  product  channel and geographic mix  the success of our product transitions and new products  competition and general economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
consequently  gross margins may fluctuate from period to period 
in addition to the factors affecting revenue described above  if we reduce prices  gross margins for our products could be lower 
our print controllers are manufactured by third party manufacturers who purchase most of the necessary components 
if our third party manufacturers cannot obtain the necessary components at favorable prices  we could experience an increase in our product costs 
we purchase certain parts directly  including processors  memory  certain asics and software licensed from various sources  including postscript interpreter software  which we license from adobe 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses increased by in over and increased by in over operating expenses as a percentage of revenue totaled   and for   and  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in versus primarily resulted from impairment charges incurred on goodwill and long lived assets during the fourth quarter of  in process research and development write off costs related to the acquisition of pace and rastek  and an increase in restructuring and other costs  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in versus primarily resulted from increases in personnel related costs 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with personnel  consulting and prototype parts 
research and development expenses were million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the slight decrease of million in was primarily due to a million decrease in personnel related costs  a million decrease in consulting expenses  and a million decrease in prototypes and non recurring engineering expenses offset by a million increase in stock based compensation expense  a million increase in depreciation of fixed assets  and a million increase in allocation of overhead expenses due to a change in allocation methodology in certain overhead expenses 
the increase of million in versus was primarily due to a million increase in employee costs related to increased headcount as a result of our investments in our research and development organizations  a million increase in consulting fees  a million increase in prototype expenses and a 
million increase in stock based compensation expense and other equity plan related costs 
research and development headcount was and as of december  and  respectively 
we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to our success and we intend to continue to devote substantial resources to research and new product development efforts 
accordingly  we expect that our research and development expenses may increase in absolute terms and also as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
sales and marketing sales and marketing include personnel expenses  costs of trade shows  marketing programs and promotional materials  sales commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation  and costs associated with sales offices in the united states  europe  asia  and other locations around the world 
sales and marketing expenses for were million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the million decrease in expenses in versus was primarily related to a million decrease in marketing and travel related expenses and a million decrease in consulting expenses offset by a million increase in stock based compensation expense  and a million increase in allocation of overhead expenses due to a change in allocation methodology in certain overhead expenses 
the million increase in expenses in versus was primarily related to a million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount and related sales commissions attributable to the increase in inkjet sales  a million increase in overhead expenses related to the inkjet expansion in the emea region  a million increase in travel related expenses  and a million increase in inkjet promotional expenses 
sales and marketing headcount was and as of december  and  respectively 
over time  our sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute terms as we continue to actively promote our products  introduce new products and services  and continue to build our sales and marketing organization  particularly in europe and asia pacific 
sales and marketing expenses may also increase as we continue to grow 
table of contents our software solutions  inkjet products  and other new product lines  which require greater sales and marketing support from us 
we expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against the euro or other currencies  sales and marketing expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with administrative personnel  legal and accounting expense and stock option investigation costs 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the million decrease in versus consists primarily of a decrease of million in legal and accounting expenses related to the stock option investigation completed in and us internal revenue code section a tax payments made to the us government on behalf of employees  a decrease of acquisition costs of million  and a decrease of million in allocation of overhead expenses as a result of a change in allocation methodology on certain overhead expenses offset by a million increase in legal expenses  and a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
the million increase in versus consists primarily of million in legal and accounting expenses related to the stock option investigation  a million increase in personnel costs as a result of headcount growth to support the growth in the vutek business  a million increase in bad debt expense due to the prior year reversal of the vutek acquisition allowance for doubtful accounts  million in costs related to an acquisition that was not consummated in the first quarter of  and a million increase in personnel costs related to the tax settlement pursuant to section a of the us internal revenue code 
restructuring and other restructuring and other costs totaled million or of revenue in we announced and implemented restructuring plans during that included organizational changes within targeted research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administration functions to better align spending levels with expected revenues 
these charges primarily include cash severance costs  benefits continuation costs  outplacement costs  and facility closure costs related to five sites 
amortization of identified intangibles amortization of identified intangibles was million or of revenue in versus million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the decrease of million in versus is due to several intangible assets becoming fully amortized in  offset partially by the increased amortization from pace and rastek intangible assets beginning in the decrease of million in versus is due to several intangible assets becoming fully amortized in in process research and development in  we incurred in process research and development expenses of million as a result of our acquisitions of pace and rastek during the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
no in process research and development expenses were incurred in in  we incurred in process research and development expenses of million as a result of our acquisition of jetrion 
interest and other income  net interest and other income interest and other income was million in compared with million in and million in the decrease of million from to was driven by lower interest income on our investments as a result of lower investment balances and interest rates as we sold a substantial portion of our investment portfolio during the first five months of in order to generate cash for the redemption of our 
table of contents convertible senior debentures  which occurred on june  interest and other income was million in compared with million in  an increase of million 
the increase was attributable to higher interest rates and higher average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
we had net realized gains on our marketable securities of million in  and net realized losses of million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest and debt amortization costs related to our convertible senior debentures 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million from to was driven by the redemption of the outstanding balance of our convertible senior debentures on june   which totaled million 
gain on sale of product line during the second quarter of  we sold our inventory and net assets related to our mobile workforce automation line of products 
goodwill and long lived asset impairment we perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill in the third quarter of each year according to the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the provision requires that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment testing to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we performed our annual valuation analysis of goodwill on september  in accordance with sfas as stated above 
the goodwill valuation analysis was performed based on our respective reporting units controller  inkjet  and advanced professional print software 
our reporting units are consistent with our product categories identified in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our product categories meet the definition of a reporting unit one level below an operating segment in accordance with sfas as each product category constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management 
we determined the fair value of the inkjet reporting unit based on a weighting of market and income approaches 
the fair value of the controller and apps reporting units was determined based on the market approach 
under the market approach  we estimated the fair value based on market multiples of revenues or earnings 
under the income approach  we measured fair value of the reporting units based on a projected cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management which is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
based on our valuation results  we had determined that the fair values of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying values 
therefore  management determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required as of september  we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant negative industry or economic trends  
table of contents significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure the potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our annual review of goodwill performed in the third quarter of indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill 
we performed our annual valuation analysis of goodwill on september  in accordance with sfas as stated above 
during the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization declined significantly as a result of declining worldwide economic conditions caused by the tightening of global credit markets 
based on a combination of factors including the recent economic environment  the resulting erosion in our market capitalization  and the lowering of our revenue outlook subsequent to the third quarter of  we performed an interim impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of based on the internal market based valuation that we performed  the fair value of the controller and apps product categories significantly exceeded their carrying value as of december  consequently  it was not considered necessary to obtain a third party valuation of these reporting units 
a third party interim valuation was obtained with respect to the inkjet product category  which was equally weighted between the income and market approach 
based on the outcome of the interim impairment analysis  we concluded that an impairment had occurred relating to the inkjet product category resulting in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of there were no impairments of goodwill  intangible assets  or other long lived assets in and solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations described above related to goodwill impairment testing  we made the following assumptions the current economic downturn will continue through fiscal year  the economic downturn is partially mitigated by new product introductions in  followed by a recovery period between and  and long term industry growth past our discounted cash flow projections for the inkjet reporting unit were based on five year financial forecasts 
the five year forecasts were based on annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing our business and through discussions with the independent valuation firm engaged by us 
the significant assumptions of these five year forecasts included annual revenue growth rates ranging from to for the inkjet reporting unit 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a mid year convention and a discount rate of 
terminal values were calculated using the gordon growth methodology with a long term growth rate of 
the sum of the fair values of the controllers  apps  and inkjet reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based on our stock price plus an estimated control premium 
the significant assumptions used in determining fair values of the reporting units using comparable company market values include the determination of appropriate market comparables  the estimated multiples of revenue  ebit  and ebitda that a willing buyer is likely to pay  and the estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 
given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn  or the period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing during the three months ended december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding 
table of contents forecasted revenue or gross margin rates are not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units  whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the third quarter of or prior to that  if any such change constitutes a triggering event outside of the quarter from when the annual goodwill impairment test is performed 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
if we were to increase the revenue growth factor by  the impairment amount would be decreased by approximately million 
if we were to decrease the revenue growth factor by  the impairment amount would be increased by approximately million 
if we were to decrease the discount rate by  the impairment amount would be decreased by approximately million 
if we were to increase the discount rate by  the impairment amount would be increased by approximately million 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our impairment test under sfas are reasonable 
however  they are judgmental  and variations in any of the assumptions or rates could result in materially different calculations of impairment amounts 
long lived assets other investments  included within long lived assets  consist of equity and debt investments in privately held companies that develop products  markets and services that are strategic to us 
investments in which we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  but do not have a majority voting interest  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the process of assessing whether a particular equity investment s fair value is less than its carrying cost requires a significant amount of judgment due to the lack of a mature and stable public market for these securities 
in making this judgment  we carefully consider the investee s most recent financial results  cash position  recent cash flow data  projected cash flows both short and long term  financing needs  recent financing rounds  most recent valuation data  the current investing environment  management or ownership changes  and competition 
this process is based primarily on information that we request and receive from these privately held companies and is performed on a quarterly basis 
although we evaluate all of our privately held equity investments for impairment based on this criteria  each investment s fair value is only estimated when events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may have a significant effect on its fair value because the fair value of each investment is not readily determinable 
where these factors indicate that the equity investment s fair value is less than its carrying cost  and where we consider such diminution in value to be other than temporary  we record an impairment charge to reduce such equity investment to its estimated net realizable value 
during the fourth quarter of  efi assessed each remaining investment s r d technology pipeline and market conditions for the next several years in the industry and determined that it is no longer probable that they will generate enough positive future cash flows to recover the full carrying amount of the investment 
as such  we recognized an impairment charge of million 
income taxes in  we recorded a tax benefit of million on a pre tax operating loss of million  compared to a tax benefit of million recorded in on pre tax operating income of million and a tax provision of million recorded in on pre tax operating income of million 
in each of these years  we benefited from research and development credits 
our taxes also decreased due to both lower taxes on foreign income in and and the extra territorial income exclusion in our taxes increased due to both non deductible stock compensation charges in each of these years  and non deductible goodwill impairment charges in as a result of discrete tax adjustments  our taxes in increased million due to interest accrued on prior year tax contingency reserves and million related to sfas r share based payment tax shortfalls 
discrete tax adjustments also reduced our taxes by million due to a reassessment of our taxes resulting 
table of contents from our filing of our federal and state income tax returns  million due to the completion of our irs audits  million due to one time severance costs and million due to a reduction in tax reserves  established in prior years on income from foreign operations 
as a result of discrete tax adjustments  our taxes in increased million due to interest accrued on prior year tax contingency reserves and million due to our reassessment of taxes resulting from our filing of our federal and state income tax returns 
discrete tax adjustments also reduced our taxes by million due to a reassessment of our federal tax contingency reserves  million due to a one time bonus payment to employees related to the temporary suspension of our espp program  million related to us internal revenue section a payments made on employees behalf  and million valuation allowance release related to compensation deductions that are no longer anticipated to be limited by us internal revenue code section m 
as a result of discrete tax adjustments  our taxes in were reduced by million as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for state income tax purposes and million due to a reassessment of tax contingency reserves related to the filing of foreign income tax returns  and were increased by million due to the migration of the non north american vutek and chipset product lines to our european headquarters and million related to sales of the mwa assets 
effective january  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by requiring a tax position be recognized only when it is more likely than not that the tax position  based on its technical merits  will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority 
the tax benefit to be recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin has been recorded as an increase of million to retained earnings  and a decrease of million and million in goodwill and taxes payable respectively 
in the third quarter of  we finalized a closing agreement with the internal revenue service irs to complete their examination of the through tax years 
as a result of the irs audit settlement  we also reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by million  of which million was recorded as a discrete tax benefit 
in conjunction with the irs audit settlement  we also reduced deferred tax assets and equity by million and million respectively and expect to pay approximately million to federal and state tax authorities as a result of the closure of the audit 
these adjustments are primarily related to intercompany cost allocations and the research and development credits 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  purchase commitments  revenue recognition and contingencies on an ongoing basis 
the estimates are based upon historical and current experience  the impact of the current economic environment  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and litigation accruals  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  valuation analyses for intangible assets and goodwill

revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from product revenue  which includes hardware controllers  design licensed solutions  and inkjet printers and ink  software and royalties 
we also receive services and support revenue from software license maintenance agreements  customer support and training and consulting 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab and  when applicable  emerging issues task force  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  for the sale of controllers  printers  and ink 
as such  revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we use either a purchase order or signed contract as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through some of our oems are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
delivery for hardware generally is complete when title and risk of loss is transferred at point of shipment from manufacturing facilities 
in some instances  we also sell products and services in which the terms included in sales arrangements result in different timing for revenue recognition 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the contract or purchase order 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we may not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we license our software primarily under perpetual licenses 
revenue from software consists of software licensing  post contract customer support and professional consulting 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  and if applicable  sab and eitf to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
when several elements  including software licenses  post contract customer support and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the revenue from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element using the residual method in accordance with sop revenue is allocated to the support elements and professional service elements of an agreement using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe and to the software license portion of the agreements using the residual method 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of our professional services based on the rates charged to our customers in stand alone orders 
we have also established vsoe of fair value for post contract customer support based on substantive renewal rates 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance and or professional services  and where the maintenance and professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
revenue allocated to software licenses is recognized when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
revenue allocated to post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract assuming the four basic criteria are met 
we also have subscription arrangements where the customer pays a fixed fee and receives services over a period of time 
we recognize revenue from the subscriptions ratably over the service period 
any upfront setup fees associated with our subscription arrangements are recognized ratably  generally over one year 

table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty reserves  and litigation accruals 
to determine the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts  management must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivables 
to do so  management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million  as of december  similarly  management must make estimates of potential future inventory obsolescence and purchase commitments to measure the need for inventory reserves 
management analyzes current economic trends  changes in customer demand and the acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of such allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowances and reserves in any accounting period 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our inventory balance was million  net of inventory reserves of million  as of december  management must make estimates of potential inventory return rates and replacement or repair costs to measure the need for warranty reserves 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing warranty reserves in any accounting period 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
warranty reserves were million as of december  we accrue for estimated legal expenses  including potential regulatory fines when the likelihood of the incurrence of the related costs is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs 
until both of these conditions are met  the related legal expenses are recorded as incurred 
the material assumptions we use to estimate the amount of legal expenses include communication between our external attorneys and us on the expected duration of the lawsuit and the estimated expenses during that time  our strategy regarding the lawsuit  the deductible amounts under the insurance policies  and past experiences with similar lawsuits 
the outcome of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted  and if the outcome is different than expected  our income could be materially impacted  either positively or negatively 
we have from time to time set up allowances or accruals for uncertainties related to revenues and for potential unfavorable outcomes from disputes with customers or vendors 
management bases its estimates for the allowances or accruals on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r  share based payment 
we must use our judgment in determining and applying the assumptions needed for the valuation of stock options  issuances under our employee stock purchase plan  and stock awards 
we also are required to apply a forfeiture rate to reflect what we believe will be our final expense related to stock based compensation 
the amounts to be recorded as stock based compensation expense expected in the future are subject to change if our assumptions for the variables used in determining the fair value of the instruments and the forfeiture rates are revised 
in adopting sfas r  we elected to adopt the simplified method to establish our beginning balance for the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation 
tax shortfalls resulting from the tax effects of employee stock based compensation in absorbed the remaining balance of the additional paid in capital pool 

table of contents accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax expense and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we either establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have maintained a valuation allowance of million as of december  for foreign tax credits resulting from the acquisition of best and compensation deductions potentially limited by us internal revenue code m 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
net deferred tax assets as of december  were million 
significant management judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions 
our gross unrecognized benefits total million as of december  our evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
if the actual settlements differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to recognize a tax benefit or an additional tax charge that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation analyses of intangible assets and goodwill 
we review goodwill annually in the third quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the provisions of sfas goodwill and other intangible assets sfas require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with our product categories identified in note information concerning business segments and major customers of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an appropriate weighting of market and income approaches 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenues or earnings of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment testing order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 

table of contents when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our annual review of goodwill performed in the third quarter of indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill 
we performed our annual valuation analysis of goodwill on september  in accordance of sfas as stated above 
valuation analysis of goodwill was performed on our respective reporting units controller  inkjet  and advanced professional print software using an equal weighing between the market and income approach for the inkjet reporting unit and using the market approach for the controller and apps reporting units 
our reporting units are consistent with our product categories identified in note information concerning business segments and major customers of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
based on our valuation results  we had determined that the fair values of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying values 
therefore  management determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required as of september  during the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization declined significantly as a result of declining worldwide economic conditions caused by the tightening of global credit markets 
based on a combination of factors including the recent economic environment  resulting erosion in our market capitalization  and the lowering of our revenue outlook subsequent to the third quarter of  we performed an interim impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of based on the internal market based valuation that we performed  the fair value of the controller and apps product categories significantly exceeded their carrying value as of december  consequently  it was not considered necessary to obtain a third party valuation of these reporting units 
a third party interim valuation was obtained with respect to the inkjet product category  which was equally weighted between the income and market approach 
based on the outcome of the interim impairment analysis  we concluded that an impairment had occurred resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million during fourth the quarter of related to both goodwill and other long lived assets 
there were no impairments of goodwill  intangible assets or other long lived assets in and solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations described above related to goodwill impairment testing  we made the following assumptions the current economic downturn will continue through fiscal year  the economic downturn is partially mitigated by new product introductions in  followed by a recovery period between and  and long term industry growth past our discounted cash flow projections for the inkjet reporting unit were based on five year financial forecasts 
the five year forecasts were based on annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing our business and through discussions with the independent valuation firm engaged by us 
the significant assumptions of these five year forecasts included annual revenue growth rates ranging from to for the inkjet reporting unit 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a mid year convention and a discount rate of 
terminal values were calculated using the gordon growth methodology with a long term growth rate of 
the sum of the fair values of the controllers  apps  and inkjet reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based on our stock price plus an estimated control premium 
the significant assumptions used in determining fair values of the reporting units using comparable company market values include the determination of appropriate market comparables  the estimated multiples of revenue  ebit  and ebitda that a willing buyer is likely to pay  and the estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 

table of contents given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn  or the period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing during the three months ended december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross margin rates are not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units  whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the third quarter of or prior to that  if any such change constitutes a triggering event outside of the quarter from when the annual goodwill impairment test is performed 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or other actual results 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include severance costs and the costs of vacating duplicate facilities 
these costs are based upon estimates made by management and are subject to refinement 
we estimate the future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities 
estimated costs may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and as management continues its assessment of the pre merger operations 
on july   we acquired pace systems group  inc pace for approximately million in cash plus an additional future cash earn out amount  which is contingent upon achieving certain performance targets 
we acquired pace to further strengthen our advanced professional print software reporting unit 
on december   we acquired raster printers  inc rastek  a mid market  wide format graphics printer developer and manufacturer  to further expand our inkjet line of products 
the pace and rastek acquisitions are discussed more fully in note acquisitions of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we apply the provisions of sfas  business combinations  when accounting for our acquisitions 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
all acquisitions are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
our financial projections may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast revenues and costs to develop such projects will transpire as projected 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidating our international operations 
we have a number of foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues  approximately of our total assets and approximately of our total liabilities as of december  we typically quote and bill our international customers in united states dollars 

table of contents based on our assessment of the factors discussed below  we consider the united states dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries except for our japanese subsidiary  electronics for imaging japan yk  for which we consider the japanese yen to be the subsidiary s functional currency and our german subsidiary  electronics for imaging gmbh  for which we consider the euro to be the subsidiary s functional currency 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  when the transactions are not denominated in the functional currency  are included within the statement of operations or  if the transactions are denominated in the functional currency  are included as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income

liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for provided by financing activities overview cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease is primarily due to the redemption on june  of our convertible senior debentures of million  repurchases of our common stock and net settlement of restricted stock units of million  and costs associated with purchases of pace and raster of million offset by cash generated by operations of million 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in  and of million  million  and million  respectively  was primarily the result of net income loss adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  acquired in process research and development  deferred income taxes  stock based compensation  other non cash charges and credits  and changes in various assets and liabilities such as accounts payable  accounts receivable  inventories  and other current assets 
our historical and primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
one measure of the effectiveness of our collection efforts is average days sales outstanding dso for accounts receivable 
dsos were days  days  and days at december   and respectively 
we calculate accounts receivable dso by dividing the net accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter by the amount of revenue recognized for the quarter multiplied by the total days in the quarter 
the increase in dsos is due to the linearity of revenues in the second half of our dsos related to direct sales are traditionally higher than those related to oem customers 
we expect dsos to vary from period to period because of changes in quarterly mix of business between our direct and oem customers  and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
as the percentage of our apps and inkjet related revenue increases  we expect dsos may trend higher 

table of contents our operating cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and by our accrual of liabilities 
in  the change in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and income taxes payable decreased our cash flows by approximately million compared to a increase in cash flows in of million 
our working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash and internally generated funds 
we expect to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict whether current trends and conditions will continue  or the effect on our business from the competitive environment in which we operate 
we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months

the maximum additional earn out is million 
headquartered in san jose  california  rastek sells uv wide format printers primarily to mid range customers in the display graphics market 
pace systems group  inc pace on july   we purchased pace for approximately million in cash  including direct acquisition costs  plus an additional cash earn out amount  which is contingent upon achieving certain performance targets 
pace is a print management software company that provides print mis and e commerce software solutions 
jetrion llc jetrion on october   we purchased jetrion for approximately million in cash 
jetrion sells industrial inkjet printers and inks to label printing companies 
we may buy or invest in companies  products and technologies within the print industry 
our available cash and equity may be used to acquire or invest in companies or products  possibly resulting in significant acquisition related charges to earnings and dilution to our stockholders 

table of contents inventories our inventories are procured primarily in support of the inkjet and controller product categories 
our inventories increased from million in to million in this increase consisted primarily of finished goods driven by the rastek acquisition  new product introductions and inventories required for new product introductions in future periods 
property and equipment our net property and equipment purchases totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
our property and equipment additions have been funded by cash from operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware software used in our business  our business outlook  and decisions to invest or expand business sites 
on january   we completed the sale of land and building to gilead for a total price of million  subject to an escrow holdback of million 
the escrow period expires january the property sold included approximately thirty acres of land and the office building located on the land at velocity way  foster city  california  consisting of approximately  square feet and certain other assets related to the property 
investments during  we received net proceeds from the sale and maturities of our marketable securities of million  of which million was used to repay the convertible senior debenture holders 
during  we received net proceeds from the sale and maturities of our marketable securities of million 
we made net purchases of marketable securities in of million 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we generally hold investments in corporate bonds and u 
s 
government agency securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest primarily in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
restricted investments we have restricted investments classified in connection with the synthetic lease for our foster city office 
we are required to maintain cash in libor based interest bearing accounts which fully collateralize our synthetic leases 
we had million in collateral accounted for as restricted investments at december  and at december   million of the million was accounted for as a non current asset as restricted investments 
the remaining million was accounted for as a current asset under assets held for sale related to the sale of a portion of our foster city offices and accompanying real estate to gilead 
for further information on these transactions  see the discussion at off balance sheet financing herein and note sale of land and building of the notes to consolidated financial statements as of december  financing activities historically  our recurring cash flows provided by financing activities have been from the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we 
table of contents received cash proceeds from these plans in the amount of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
while we may continue to receive proceeds from these plans in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans and general market conditions 
we anticipate that cash provided from exercise of stock options may decline over time as we shift to issuance of restricted stock awards and units rather than stock option awards 
the primary use of funds for financing activities in   and was the use of million  million  and million  respectively  of cash to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for further discussion of our programs to repurchase our common stock 
the synthetic lease agreements for our corporate headquarters existing at december  provided for residual value guarantees 
under fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined that the guarantees have no material value as of december  and therefore have not recorded any liability 
on june   we exercised our option to redeem and paid in cash the outstanding balance of our convertible senior debentures  which totaled million 
the redemption price for the securities was of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest amounts to but not including the redemption date 
accrued and unpaid interest expense up to june  for the fiscal year ended december  totaled million 
other commitments our inventory for our controller line of products consists primarily of raw and finished goods  memory subsystems  processors and asics which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our products 
our inventory for our inkjet line of products consists of raw and finished goods  printheads  frames and other components 
should we decide to purchase components and do our own manufacturing of controllers  or should it become necessary for us to purchase and sell components other than the processors  asics or memory subsystems for our contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially property and equipment would increase significantly  thereby reducing our available cash resources 
further  the inventory we carry could become obsolete  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations if such supply were reduced or not available 
we may be required to compensate our sub contract manufacturers for components purchased for orders subsequently cancelled by us 
we periodically review the potential liability and the adequacy of the related allowance 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we were required to compensate the sub contract manufacturers in amounts in excess of the related allowance 
legal proceedings in addition to the matters discussed under item  legal proceedings  we are involved from time to time in litigation relating to claims arising in the normal course of our business 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total lease obligations related to the principal corporate facilities are estimated and are based on current market interest rates libor 
see off balance sheet financing 
total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  or certain purchase orders as discussed below 
in january   we sold the  square foot building and approximately acres of land in our foster city  california campus to gilead 
as a result  total operating lease obligations for and beyond will decrease by approximately million 
purchase obligations in the table above include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services that are cancelable without penalty 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
see note income taxes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
off balance sheet financing synthetic lease arrangements as of december  we were a party to two synthetic leases the lease and the lease  together leases covering our foster city facilities located at and velocity way  foster city  california 
these leases provided a cost effective means of providing adequate office space for our corporate offices 
both leases expire in july the leases included an option to purchase the facilities during or at the end of the term of the leases for the amount expended by the lessor to purchase the facilities 
the funds pledged under the leases million for the lease and million for the lease at december  for a total of million are in libor based interest bearing accounts and are restricted as to withdrawal at all times 
we have exercised our purchase option in the first quarter of with respect to the lease in connection with the sale of the land and building to gilead 
accordingly  the million of pledged funds have been re classified as assets held for sale under current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  on january   we completed the sale of land and building to gilead for a total price of million  subject to an escrow holdback of million 
the escrow period expires january the property sold 
table of contents included approximately thirty acres of land and the office building located on the land at velocity way  foster city  california  consisting of approximately  square feet and certain other assets related to the property 
we have guaranteed to the lessor a residual value associated with the buildings equal to of their funding of the respective leases 
under the financial covenants  we must maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum tangible net worth as of the end of each quarter 
there is an additional covenant regarding mergers 
we were in compliance with all such financial and merger related covenants as of december  we have assessed our exposure in relation to the first loss guarantees under the leases and have determined that there is no deficiency to the guaranteed value at december  if there is a decline in value  we will record a loss associated with the residual value guarantee 
in conjunction with the leases  we have entered into separate ground leases with the lessor for approximately years 
as of december   we were treated as the owner of these buildings for federal income tax purposes 
since we exercised our purchase option with respect to the lease  our maximum exposure under our remaining synthetic lease arrangement is million as of january  effective july   we applied the accounting and disclosure rules set forth in interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised fin r for variable interest entities vies 
we have evaluated our synthetic lease agreements to determine if the arrangements qualify as variable interest entities under fin r 
we have determined that the synthetic lease agreements do qualify as vies  however  because we are not the primary beneficiary under fin r we are not required to consolidate the vies in our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  general credit  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  liquidity  and interest rate risks  which may be exacerbated by the tightening of global credit markets and increase in economic uncertainty that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may enter into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
interest rate risk marketable securities we maintain an investment portfolio of short term investments of various holdings  types and maturities 
these short term investments are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points over a twelve month time horizon 

table of contents this table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a twelve month time horizon in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of basis points no change in interest rates valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of basis points derivatives we do not use any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales in japan and europe and operating expenses in europe  india and japan 
at the present time  we do not hedge against these currency exposures  but as these exposures grow we may consider hedging against currency movements 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities  typically us treasury and agencies securities  corporate debt instruments  and asset backed instruments 
these short term investments are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading
