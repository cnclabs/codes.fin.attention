outbreaks of disease among or attributed to livestock can significantly affect production  the supply of raw materials  demand for our products and our business 
we take precautions to ensure that our livestock are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary manner 
nevertheless  we are subject to risks relating to our ability to maintain animal health and control diseases 
livestock health problems could adversely impact production  the supply of raw materials and consumer confidence in all of our operating segments 
from time to time  we have experienced outbreaks of certain livestock diseases  such as the outbreaks of classical swine fever at three of our hog farms in romania in august and the outbreak of circovirus at our us facilities that began in late fiscal we may experience additional occurrences of disease in the future 
disease can reduce the number of offspring produced  hamper the growth of livestock to finished size  result in expensive vaccination programs and require in some cases the destruction of infected livestock  all of which could adversely affect our production or ability to sell or export our products 
adverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products  particularly as we expand our branded pork products 
in addition to risks associated with maintaining the health of our livestock  any outbreak of disease elsewhere in the us or in other countries could reduce consumer confidence in the meat products affected by the particular disease  generate adverse publicity and result in the imposition of import or export restrictions 
outbreaks of disease among or attributed to livestock also may have indirect consequences that adversely affect our business 
for example  past outbreaks of avian influenza in various parts of the world reduced the global demand for poultry and thus created a temporary surplus of poultry both domestically and internationally 
this poultry surplus placed downward pressure on poultry prices which in turn reduced meat prices including pork both in the us and internationally 
concerns regarding a hn influenza could adversely affect our business 
there has been substantial publicity regarding the recent a hn influenza outbreak 
although the a hn virus is a combination of human  bird and swine strains of influenza  the initial and widespread media reports regarding this illness labeled it the swine flu or a variation thereof 
in addition  early media attention of the virus focused on a hog farm in veracruz  mexico owned by granjas carroll de mexico  a joint venture of ours  approximately five miles from the town of la gloria where some speculated that the initial outbreak of a hn may have occurred 
to date  there is no evidence that a hn is present in the swine herds at any of our worldwide operations 
moreover  the cdc and other regulatory and scientific bodies have confirmed that people cannot contract a hn influenza from eating cooked pork or pork products  regardless whether the livestock used in such products was infected by a hn 
while we experienced a temporary decline in sales due to the perceived risk of a hn and pork prices dropped sharply in a period in which prices normally move higher  we believe the a hn threat to our business was short lived and is now largely behind us 
however  consumers perceptions regarding the virus may negatively impact demand for our pork products in the future and lead to new restrictions on the export of our products to key export markets  resulting in reduced export sales and downward pressure on live hog prices in the us there are still a number of potentially significant unanswered questions about a hn  including where the strain originated  when it will run its course and whether it will mutate 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict whether the a hn influenza outbreak will have a significant adverse effect on our future financial results 
such an effect could result from  among other things  a decline in demand for our pork products  depressed market conditions for our hogs internationally and or domestically or the imposition of material import or export restrictions 
any perceived or real health risks related to our products or the food industry generally or increased regulation could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
we are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally  including risks posed by the following food spoilage or food contamination  evolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health related concerns  consumer product liability claims  product tampering  the possible unavailability and expense of product liability insurance  and the potential cost and disruption of a product recall 
adverse publicity concerning any perceived or real health risk associated with our products could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products  which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products  particularly as we expand our branded products business 
we could also be adversely affected by perceived or real health risks associated with similar products produced by others to the extent such risks cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of such products generally and  therefore  lead customers to opt for other meat options that are perceived as safe 
the a hn influenza outbreak illustrates the adverse impact that can result from perceived health risks associated with the products we sell 
although the cdc and other regulatory and scientific bodies have indicated that people cannot get a hn influenza from eating cooked pork or pork products  the perception of some consumers that the disease could be transmitted in that manner was the apparent cause of a recent decline in pork consumption 
our products are susceptible to contamination by disease producing organisms  or pathogens  such as listeria monocytogenes  salmonella  campylobacter and generic e 
coli 
because these pathogens are generally found in the environment  there is a risk that they  as a result of food processing  could be present in our products 
we have systems in place designed to monitor food safety risks throughout all stages of our vertically integrated process 
however  we cannot assure you that such systems  even when working effectively  will eliminate the risks related to food safety 
these pathogens can also be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further processing  foodservice or consumer level 
in addition to the risks caused by our processing operations and the subsequent handling of the products  we may encounter the same risks if any third party tampers with our products 
we could be required to recall certain of our products in the event of contamination or adverse test results 
any product contamination also could subject us to product liability claims  adverse publicity and government scrutiny  investigation or intervention  resulting in increased costs and decreased sales as customers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products 
any of these events could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
our manufacturing facilities and products  including the processing  packaging  storage  distribution  advertising and labeling of our products  are subject to extensive federal  state and foreign laws and regulations in the food safety area  including constant government inspections and governmental food processing controls 
loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand  introducing new products  building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results 
if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations  particularly if it related to or compromises food safety  we could be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or asset seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition  future material changes in food safety regulations could result in increased operating costs or could be required to be implemented on schedules that cannot be met without interruptions in our operations 
environmental regulation and related litigation and commitments could have a material adverse effect on us 
our past and present business operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment  including among others the discharge of materials into the environment  the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes  and the emission of greenhouse gases 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us  including civil and criminal penalties  liability for damages and negative publicity 
some requirements applicable to us may also be enforced by citizen groups or other third parties 
natural disasters  such as flooding and hurricanes  can cause the discharge of effluents or other waste into the environment  potentially resulting in our being subject to further liability claims and governmental regulation as has occurred in the past 
see item business regulation for further discussion of regulatory compliance as it relates to environmental risk 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations 
we also face the risk of nuisance lawsuits even if we are operating in compliance with applicable regulations 
currently we are defending a number of nuisance suits with respect to farms in missouri  and before we acquired psf  other nuisance suits in missouri resulted in jury verdicts against psf and cgc 
see item legal proceedings missouri litigation 
in addition  pursuant to a voluntary agreement with the state of north carolina  we committed to implement environmentally superior and economically feasible technologies for the management of swine waste at our farms in north carolina provided a determination is made by an expert from north carolina state university that such technologies are both environmentally superior and economically feasible to construct and operate at such farms 
we also acquired psf in fiscal  which entered into environmental consent decrees in the state of missouri requiring psf to research  develop and implement new technologies to control wastewater  air and odor emissions from its missouri farms 
see item business environmental stewardship and item business regulation for further information regarding these obligations 
we cannot assure you that the costs of carrying out these obligations will not exceed previous estimates or that requirements applicable to us will not be altered in ways that will require us to incur significant additional costs and adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  new environmental issues could arise that would cause currently unanticipated investigations  assessments or expenditures 
governmental authorities may take further action restricting our ability to own livestock or to engage in farming or restricting such operations generally  which could adversely affect our business 
a number of states  including iowa and missouri  have adopted legislation that prohibits or restricts the ability of meat packers  or in some cases corporations generally  from owning livestock or engaging in farming 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into a settlement agreement with the state of iowa whereby the state agreed not to enforce its restrictive legislation on us for a period of ten years 
as a part of our settlement  we committed to pay  per year for years to support various programs benefiting the swine industry in iowa 
we also agreed to purchase a specified minimum number of hogs to be processed by us in iowa and south dakota on the open market for two years 
other states have similar legislation restricting the ability of corporations or others from owning livestock farms or engaging in farming 
in addition  congress has recently considered federal legislation that would ban meat packers from owning livestock 
we cannot assure you that such or similar legislation affecting our operations will not be adopted at the federal or state levels in the future 
such legislation  if adopted and applicable to our current operations and not successfully challenged or settled  could have a material adverse impact on our operations and our financial statements 
in fiscal  the state of north carolina enacted a permanent moratorium on the construction of new hog farms using the lagoon and sprayfield system 
the moratorium limits us from expanding our north carolina production operations 
this permanent moratorium replaced a year moratorium on the construction of hog farms with more than hogs or the expansion of existing large farms 
this moratorium may over time lead to increased competition for contract growers 
our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position 
as of may   we had approximately  million of indebtedness  guarantees of up to million for the financial obligations of certain unconsolidated joint ventures and hog farmers  guarantees of million for leases that were transferred to jbs in connection with the sale of smithfield beef  and aggregate unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities totaling  million  taking into account outstanding borrowings of million and outstanding letters of credit of million 
our indebtedness may increase from time to time in the future for various reasons  including fluctuations in operating results  capital expenditures and potential acquisitions or joint ventures 
in addition  due to the volatile nature of the commodities markets  we may have to borrow significant amounts to cover any margin calls under our risk management and hedging programs 
during fiscal  margin deposits posted by us ranged from million to million 
our consolidated indebtedness level could significantly affect our business because it may  together with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness  significantly limit or impair our ability in the future to obtain financing  refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and materially impair our liquidity  a downgrade in our credit rating could restrict or impede our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs 
for example  in fiscal  both standard poor s rating services and moody s investors services twice downgraded our credit ratings  which resulted in increased interest expense  and our credit rating is currently on negative watch by both agencies  it may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise  a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to interest payments on our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes  which amount would increase if prevailing interest rates rise  and it could make us more vulnerable to downturns in general economic or industry conditions or in our business 
further  our debt agreements restrict the payment of dividends to shareholders and under certain circumstances may limit additional borrowings  investments  the acquisition or disposition of assets  mergers and transactions with affiliates  the creation of liens and the repayment of certain debt 
in addition  our us credit facility  euro credit facility and senior secured note agreements contain financial covenants and other conditions tied to leverage  interest coverage and working capital 
for example  as more fully described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations debt covenants and the incurrence test  the indentures relating to our senior unsecured notes preclude us from incurring certain additional indebtedness and restrict us from engaging in certain other activities  including paying cash dividends  repurchasing our common stock and making certain investments when our interest coverage ratio is less than to the incurrence test 
as of may   we did not meet the incurrence test and we do not expect to meet the incurrence test again until the third quarter of fiscal at the earliest 
failure to meet the incurrence test limits our flexibility in accessing the credit markets and  should this failure continue  could adversely affect our business and financial condition by  among other things  limiting our ability to obtain financing  refinance existing indebtedness when it becomes due and take advantage of corporate opportunities 
should market conditions continue to deteriorate or fail to improve  or our operating results continue to be depressed in the future  we may have to request amendments to our covenants and restrictions 
for example  in fiscal we obtained amendments to our us credit facility and euro credit facility  reducing the interest coverage ratios in those agreements until january  fiscal 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such relief should it be needed in the future 
a breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default that would permit our senior lenders  including lenders under the us credit facility  the euro credit facility or rabobank term loan  or the holders of the senior unsecured notes or the privately placed senior secured notes  as the case may be  to declare all amounts borrowed under the us credit facility  the euro credit facility  the senior unsecured notes or the senior secured notes to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and the commitments of the relevant senior lenders to make further extensions of credit under the us credit facility or the euro credit facility could be terminated 
if we were unable to repay our indebtedness to our lenders under our secured debt  these lenders could proceed  where applicable  against the collateral securing that indebtedness  which could include substantially all of our assets 
our future ability to comply with financial covenants and other conditions  make scheduled payments of principal and interest  or refinance existing borrowings depends on future business performance that is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors  including the other risks in this item a 
our ability to maintain an adequate level of liquidity in the future is dependent on our ability to refinance our us credit facility which matures in august fiscal  our euro credit facility which matures in august fiscal with commitments reduced in august fiscal and our senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes due in october fiscal 
the capital markets worldwide  including the us  have been severely impacted by credit losses  asset write downs and failures of some financial institutions 
this disruption has impacted credit spreads and pricing on new securities issuances 
we may not be successful in implementing and executing on our pork restructuring plan 
in february  we announced a plan to consolidate and streamline the corporate structure and manufacturing operations in our pork segment to improve operating efficiencies and increase utilization 
the restructuring plan will result in the consolidation of several of our pork segment business units into three large operating companies 
we believe that it will allow us to focus on maximizing operating  marketing  financial and logistical synergies that will enable us to better meet the needs of our retail  foodservice and international customers who do business with multiple smithfield foods companies 
we can provide no assurance  however  that the restructuring plan will result in the expected level of annual cost savings and improved pre tax earnings 
our operations are subject to the risks associated with acquisitions and investments in joint ventures 
although our overall focus has shifted from acquisitions to integration of existing operations  we may continue to review opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions in the future 
we have also pursued and may in the future pursue strategic growth through investment in joint ventures 
these acquisitions and investments may involve large transactions or realignment of existing investments such as the recent merger of groupe smithfield and campofr o 
these transactions present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including diversion of management attention from other business concerns  difficulty with integrating businesses  operations  personnel and financial and other systems  lack of experience in operating in the geographical market of the acquired business  increased levels of debt potentially leading to associated reduction in ratings of our debt securities and adverse impact on our various financial ratios  the requirement that we periodically review the value at which we carry our investments in joint ventures  and  in the event we determine that the value at which we carry a joint venture investment has been impaired  the requirement to record a non cash impairment charge  which charge could substantially affect our reported earnings in the period of such charge  would negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business  assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired businesses  potential disputes with the sellers  and for our investments  potential lack of common business goals and strategies with  and cooperation of  our joint venture partners 
in addition  acquisitions outside the us may present unique difficulties and increase our exposure to those risks associated with international operations 
we could experience financial or other setbacks if any of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future have problems of which we are not aware or liabilities that exceed expectations 
see item legal proceedings missouri litigation regarding lawsuits filed in missouri against psf and cgc by neighboring individuals largely based on the laws of nuisance 
although we are continuing psf s vigorous defense of these claims  we cannot assure you that we will be successful  that additional nuisance claims will not arise in the future or that the reserves for this litigation will not have to be substantially increased 
we are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations 
sales to international customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal we conduct foreign operations in poland  romania and the united kingdom and export our products to more than countries 
in addition  we are engaged in joint ventures mainly in mexico and china and have significant investments in western europe 
as of may   approximately of our long lived assets were associated with our foreign operations 
because of the growing market share of us pork products in the international markets  us exporters are increasingly being affected by measures taken by importing countries to protect local producers 
as a result  our international sales  operations and investments are subject to various risks related to economic or political uncertainties including among others general economic and political conditions  imposition of tariffs  quotas  trade barriers and other trade protection measures imposed by foreign countries  the closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of our products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues  difficulties and costs associated with complying with  and enforcing remedies under  a wide variety of complex domestic and international laws  treaties and regulations  different regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments  tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  and distribution costs  disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation 
furthermore  our foreign operations are subject to the risks described above as well as additional risks and uncertainties including among others fluctuations in currency values  which have affected  among other things  the costs of our investments in foreign operations  translation of foreign currencies into us dollars  and foreign currency exchange controls 
occurrence of any of these events in the markets where we operate or in other markets we are developing could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in those markets and could adversely affect our financial results 
our operations are subject to the general risks of litigation 
we are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise 
trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers  shareholders  employees or injured persons  and claims related to commercial  labor  employment  antitrust  securities or environmental matters 
moreover  the process of litigating cases  even if we are successful  may be costly  and may approximate the cost of damages sought 
these actions could also expose us to adverse publicity  which might adversely affect our brands  reputation and or customer preference for our products 
litigation trends and expenses and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends  expenses and outcomes could adversely affect our financial results 
we depend on availability of  and satisfactory relations with  our employees 
as of may   we had approximately  employees   of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions 
our operations depend on the availability  retention and relative costs of labor and maintaining satisfactory relations with employees and the labor unions 
further  employee shortages can and do occur  particularly in rural areas where some of our operations are located 
labor relations issues arise from time to time  including issues in connection with union efforts to represent employees at our plants and with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory relations with our employees or with the unions  we may experience labor strikes  work stoppages or other labor disputes 
negotiation of collective bargaining agreements also could result in higher ongoing labor costs 
in addition  the discovery by us or governmental authorities of undocumented workers  as has occurred in the past  could result in our having to attempt to replace those workers  which could be disruptive to our operations or may be difficult to do 
immigration reform continues to attract significant attention in the public arena and the us congress 
if new immigration legislation is enacted  such laws may contain provisions that could increase our costs in recruiting  training and retaining employees 
also  although our hiring practices comply with the requirements of federal law in reviewing employees citizenship or authority to work in the us  increased enforcement efforts with respect to existing immigration laws by governmental authorities may disrupt a portion of our workforce or our operations at one or more of our facilities  thereby negatively impacting our business 
we cannot assure you that these activities or consequences will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
the continued consolidation of customers could negatively impact our business 
our ten largest customers represented approximately of net sales for fiscal year we do not have long term sales agreements other than to certain third party hog customers or other contractual assurances as to future sales to these major customers 
in addition  continued consolidation within the retail industry  including among supermarkets  warehouse clubs and food distributors  has resulted in an increasingly concentrated retail base and increased our credit exposure to certain customers 
our business could be materially adversely affected and suffer significant set backs in sales and operating income if our larger customers plans  markets  and or financial condition should change significantly 
an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 
goodwill is recorded at fair value and is not amortized  but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill  we make assumptions regarding future operating performance  business trends  and market and economic conditions 
such analyses further require us to make judgmental assumptions about sales  operating margins  growth rates  and discount rates 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to management s judgment in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill recoverability 
goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units based on market multiples of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization or on the estimated present value of future discounted cash flows 
we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business  unexpected significant declines in operating results  divestiture of a significant component of our business and market capitalization declines 
for example  at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  we performed an interim test of the carrying amount of goodwill related to our us hog production operations 
we undertook this test due to the significant losses recently incurred in our hog production operations and the deteriorating macro economic environment 
we determined that the fair value of our us hog production reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
therefore goodwill was not impaired 
however  these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in non cash goodwill impairment charges in the future 
beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of fiscal and continuing into june  our market capitalization was below our book value  which is a potential indicator of impairment 
if this trend continues and the future operating performance of our reporting units is not consistent with our assumptions  we could be required to record non cash goodwill impairment charges 
impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges 
in addition  impairment charges would negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future 
as of may   we had million of goodwill  which represented approximately of total assets 
deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 
our business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions  including inflation  interest rates  availability of capital markets  consumer spending rates  energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 
any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials  cooking ingredients and packaging materials  thereby negatively affecting our financial results 
the downturn in the us economy may result in reduced demand for certain of our products  downward pressure on prices and shifts to less profitable private label products 
moreover  any material reduction in demand for our products in our key export markets china  japan  mexico  russia and canada could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the recent disruptions and instability in credit and other financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions  could  among other things make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future  cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any technical or other waivers under our credit agreements to the extent we may seek them in the future  impair the financial condition of some of our customers  suppliers or counterparties to our derivative instruments  thereby increasing customer bad debts  non performance by suppliers or counterparty failures negatively impacting our treasury operations  negatively impact global demand for protein products  which could result in a reduction of sales  operating income and cash flows  decrease the value of our investments in equity and debt securities  including our company owned life insurance and pension plan assets  which could result in higher pension cost and statutorily mandated funding requirements  and impair the financial viability of our insurers

missouri litigation psf is a wholly owned subsidiary that we acquired on may  when a wholly owned subsidiary of ours merged with and into psf 
as a result of our acquisition of psf and through other separate acquisitions by cgc of our common stock  cgc currently beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
paul j 
fribourg  cgc s chairman  president and ceo  is now a director of ours and michael j 
zimmerman  cgc s executive vice president and chief financial officer  is now an advisory director to the company 
in  lawsuits based on the law of nuisance were filed against psf and cgc in the circuit court of jackson county  missouri entitled steven adwell  et al 
v 
psf  et al 
and michael adwell  et al 
v 
psf  et al 
in november  a jury trial involving six plaintiffs in the adwell cases resulted in a jury verdict of compensatory damages for those six plaintiffs in the amount of  each for a total of million 
the jury also found that cgc and psf were liable for punitive damages  however  the parties agreed to settle the plaintiffs claims for the amount of the compensatory damages  and the plaintiffs waived punitive damages 
on march   the court severed the claims of the remaining adwell plaintiffs into separate actions and ordered that they be consolidated for trial by household 
in the second adwell trial  a jury trial involving three plaintiffs resulted in a jury verdict in december in favor of psf and cgc as to all claims 
on july   the court reconsolidated the claims of the remaining adwell plaintiffs for trial by farm 
on february   the court also ordered that the adwell plaintiffs living around each of the three farms at issue will be further divided into two groups based on the time periods covered by their claims 
as a result  there may be as many as six additional trials in the adwell cases  two for each farm 
however  the court left open the possibility for reconsolidation on a farm by farm basis in the future 
the court has scheduled the next adwell trial  which will resolve the claims of to plaintiffs who live near homan farm  to commence on february  the court has also scheduled another adwell trial  which will resolve the claims of certain plaintiffs who live near scott colby farm  to commence on january  in march  the same attorneys representing the adwell plaintiffs filed two additional nuisance lawsuits in the circuit court of jackson county  missouri entitled fred torrey  et al 
v 
psf  et al 
and doyle bounds  et al 
v 
psf  et al 
there are seven plaintiffs in both suits combined  each of whom claims to live near swine farms owned or under contract with psf 
plaintiffs allege that these farms interfered with the plaintiffs use and enjoyment of their respective properties 
plaintiffs in the torrey suit also allege trespass 
in may  two additional nuisance suits were filed in the circuit court of daviess county  missouri entitled vernon hanes  et al 
v 
psf  et al 
and steve hanes et al 
v 
psf  et al 
plaintiffs in the vernon hanes case allege nuisance  negligence  violation of civil rights  and negligence of contractor 
in addition  plaintiffs in both the vernon and steve hanes cases assert personal injury and property damage claims 
plaintiffs seek recovery of an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages  costs and attorneys fees  as well as injunctive relief 
on march   plaintiffs in the vernon hanes case voluntarily dismissed all claims without prejudice 
a new petition was filed by the vernon hanes plaintiffs on april   alleging nuisance  negligence and trespass against six defendants  including us 
the vernon hanes case was transferred to dekalb county and has been set for trial to commence on august  also in may  the same lead lawyer who filed the adwell  bounds and torrey lawsuits filed a putative class action lawsuit entitled daniel herrold  et al 
and others similarly situated v 
contigroup companies  inc  psf  and psf group holdings  inc 
in the circuit court of jackson county  missouri 
this action originally sought to create a class of plaintiffs living within ten miles of psf s farms in northern missouri  including contract grower farms  who were alleged to have suffered interference with their right to use and enjoy their respective properties 
on january   plaintiffs in the herrold case filed a second amended petition in which they abandoned all class action allegations and efforts to certify the action as a class action and added an additional named plaintiffs to join the seven prior class representatives to pursue a one count claim to recover monetary damages  both actual and punitive  for temporary nuisance 
psf filed motions arguing that the second amended petition  which abandons the putative class action and adds new plaintiffs  is void procedurally and that the case should either be dismissed or the plaintiffs claims severed and removed under missouri s venue statute to the northern missouri counties in which the alleged injuries occurred 
on june   the court entered an order denying the motion to dismiss but granting defendants motion to transfer venue 
as a result of those rulings  the claims of all but seven of the plaintiffs have been transferred to the appropriate venue in northern missouri 
following the initial transfers  plaintiffs filed motions to transfer each of the cases back to jackson county 
those motions were denied in all nine cases  but seven cases were transferred to neighboring counties pursuant to missouri s venue rules 
following all transfers  herrold cases were pending in chariton  clark  dekalb  harrison  jackson  linn  and nodaway counties 
plaintiffs agreed to file amended petitions in all cases except jackson county  however  amended petitions have been filed in only chariton  clark  harrison and nodaway counties 
pursuant to notices of dismissal filed by plaintiffs on january  february and april   all cases in nodaway county have been dismissed 
discovery is now proceeding in the remaining cases where amended petitions have been filed

we believe we have good defenses to all of the actions described above and intend to defend vigorously these suits 
souderton facility our former souderton facility  which is now owned by jbs souderton  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of jbs packerland  inc 
collectively jbs packerland  has previously experienced wastewater releases and an operational upset 
the civil and criminal investigations into these incidents by the environmental protection agency the epa  the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep and the pennsylvania fish and boat commission are still on going 
the souderton facility was a part of our sale of smithfield beef to jbs packerland which was completed in october fiscal 
under the terms of the sale  we have indemnification obligations for specified losses related to these pre closing wastewater releases and operational upset at the souderton facility 
however  jbs packerland has assumed all remaining capital costs associated with the planned wastewater treatment system upgrade to which we agreed with padep after the two wastewater incidents in at this time  we do not believe that these indemnification obligations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on november   padep issued a unilateral administrative order requiring development and implementation of a plan for certain corrective action activities relative to the prior rendering plant release  including  but not limited to  examination of pipes leading from the rendering facility  replacement of compromised piping  if any  construction of a new intercept sewer from rendering to the facility s wastewater treatment plant  and the submission of a written report describing actions taken to comply with the administrative order 
these requirements are consistent with activities we  the epa and padep have previously concurred are appropriate in terms of preventing further occurrences and on which the parties had already been working 
padep did not order the payment of any fine or penalties in this order 
the epa filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against jbs packerland on december  relative to the prior releases 
this maintains epa s jurisdiction over the process and barred the threatened filing of a suit by a local citizens group 
the epa  padep and jbs packerland filed a joint motion to extend the answer deadline in order to allow time to continue and complete settlement discussions and the court granted the motion 
farmland crete facility in december  epa region issued a notice of violation the nov to farmland relative to farmland s facility in crete  nebraska 
the nov alleges that the crete facility exceeded opacity limitations and violated  testing and recordkeeping requirements specified in an air permit issued to the crete facility by the nebraska department of environmental quality 
after an internal investigation by outside counsel  counsel and representatives of the company held an informal conference with the epa  and the epa proposed a monetary penalty of approximately  settlement discussions are ongoing and management believes  although we can provide no assurance  that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
bedford facility as we have previously disclosed  environmental releases at our former meat processing and packaging facility located in bedford  virginia occurred in fiscal and fiscal our smithfield packing subsidiary operated the facility  which closed in fiscal as part of our previously announced east coast restructuring plan 
federal  state and local officials investigated all of the releases under applicable environmental laws in fiscal and fiscal and  as of the date of this report  we are not aware of any contemplated material legal proceedings with respect to any of these releases 
if any such legal proceeding is commenced  depending on the results of the investigations  then we could face potential monetary penalties 
however  management believes  although we can provide no assurance  that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations
