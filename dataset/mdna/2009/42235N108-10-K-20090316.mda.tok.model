item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
overview general our primary business is to provide bank card payment processing services to merchants in the united states and canada 
this involves facilitating the exchange of information and funds between merchants and cardholders financial institutions  providing end to end electronic payment processing services to merchants  including merchant set up and training  transaction authorization and electronic draft capture  clearing and settlement  merchant accounting  merchant assistance and support and risk management 
our merchant customers primarily fall into two categories  our core small and mid sized merchants referred to as small and midsized enterprises  or sme and large national merchants  primarily in the petroleum industry 
we also provide additional services to our merchants  such as payroll processing  gift and loyalty programs  and paper check processing  and we sell and rent point of sale devices and supplies 
on january   we publicly announced the processing system intrusion  which apparently had occurred during some portion of see processing system intrusion for more detail 
at december   we provided our bank card payment processing services to approximately  active sme bank card merchants located across the united states 
this represents a increase over the  active sme bank card merchants at december  at december   we provided bank card payment processing services to approximately large national merchants with approximately  locations 
our total bank card processing volume for the year ended december  was billion  a increase from the billion processed during the year ended december  bank card processing volume for includes billion for large national merchants acquired with network services 
for the years ended december  and  our bank card processing volume was billion and billion  respectively 
in may  we acquired the net assets of the network services business unit network services of alliance data network services llc alliance  for a cash payment of million 
the acquisition was financed through a combination of cash on hand and our credit facilities 
network services provides processing of credit and debit cards to large national merchants  primarily in the petroleum industry 
network services settled million transactions representing over billion of total annual visa and mastercard bank card processing volume in in addition to settling visa and mastercard transactions  network services processes a wide range of payment transactions for its predominantly petroleum customer base  including providing approximately billion transaction authorizations through its front end card processing systems primarily for visa and mastercard in network services added billion to our bank card processing volume on million settled transactions since its acquisition through december  additionally  network services generated revenues on billion transactions it authorized through its front end card processing systems since its acquisition through december  
table of contents in march  we acquired a majority interest in collective point of sale solutions ltd 
cpos for a net cash payment of million 
cpos is a canadian provider of payment processing services and secure point of sale solutions 
this acquisition added approximately  canadian merchants and provides us an entrance into the canadian credit and debit card processing market 
we are now able to service merchants that have locations in both the united states and canada 
we do not expect the acquisition of cpos to have a material impact on our revenues or net income 
in november  we acquired the net assets of chockstone  inc chockstone for a net cash payment of million 
the chockstone acquisition expands our ability to equip merchants nationwide with enhanced gift card and loyalty programs 
chockstone s loyalty platform helps businesses of all sizes identify their most profitable customers and market to their unique needs thereby increasing the frequency of their visits and the size of their average purchases 
chockstone s loyalty marketing and gift card solutions are used by leading brands in more than  restaurants  convenience stores  and other retail locations in north america 
we do not expect the acquisition of chockstone to have a material impact on our revenues or net income 
we have developed a number of proprietary payment processing systems to increase our operating efficiencies and distribute our processing and merchant data to our three main constituencies our merchant base  our sales force and our customer service staff 
in  we began providing authorization and data capture services to our sme merchants through our own front end processing system  which we call hps exchange 
in  we began providing clearing  settlement and merchant accounting services through our own internally developed back end processing system  which we call passport 
passport enables us to customize these services to the needs of our relationship managers and sme merchants 
currently  we are further developing hps exchange and passport to process the large national merchants which we acquired with network services 
during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our sme transactions were processed through hps exchange  which has decreased our operating costs per transaction 
at december  and  approximately of our active sme merchants were processing on passport  which also has contributed to decreasing our operating costs per transaction 
with our conversion to passport  our internally developed systems are providing substantially all aspects of most of our merchants processing needs  excluding network services 
previously  we relied on third party vendors for many of these services including bank card authorization and data capture services  settlement and merchant accounting services 
we will continue to process a minority of our transactions through third party front end systems 
the bank card revenue we earn in our sme business is recurring in nature  as we typically enter into three year service contracts with our card processing merchants that  in order to qualify for the agreed upon pricing  require the merchant to achieve bank card processing volume minimums 
most of our sme revenue is payment processing fees  which are a combination of a fee equal to a percentage of the dollar amount of each visa or mastercard transaction we process plus a flat fee per transaction 
we make mandatory payments of interchange fees to card issuing banks through visa and mastercard and dues  assessments and other network fees to visa and mastercard 
our sme gross bank card processing revenue is largely driven by visa and mastercard volume processed by merchants with whom we have processing contracts  as such  we also generally benefit from consumers increasing use of bank cards in place of cash and checks  and sales growth experienced by our retained bank card merchants 
in contrast  network services revenues are largely driven by the number of transactions it processes whether settled  or only authorized  not its processing volume  as the larger merchants which comprise network services customer base pay on a per transaction basis for processing services 
significant increases in our sales force have led to significant growth in the number of sme merchants for whom we process 
our sales managers are compensated based on their success in growing the sales force and increasing the total sme bank card  payroll and check processing merchants in their regions 
our number of total relationship managers grew from at december  and  at december   to  at december  we measure the production of our sales force by gross margin installed  which reflects the expected annual gross profit from a merchant customer contract after deducting processing and servicing costs associated with that revenue 
in  our installed gross margin increased over levels  which in turn represented a increase over levels 
the number of total sme bank card  payroll and check processing merchants we installed during year ended december  was  new merchants installed  compared to 
table of contents  new merchants installed during the year ended december  and  new merchants installed during the year ended december  our installed margin has grown faster than merchant count due both to installing larger merchants  and increases in margin per dollar processed 
as a result of our commission only compensation system for our sales force  we are able to increase the size of our sales force with minimal upfront costs 
however  since we pay signing bonuses and commissions approximating of the gross margin generated by a sme merchant in its first year  growth in installed margin consumes significant capital  as it typically takes approximately one year s processing to cover the outlays for signing bonuses  commissions and payroll taxes 
in our sme business  same store sales growth  which represents the change in bank card processing volume for all bank card merchants that were processing with us in the same month a year earlier  contracted by on average in  compared to growth of on average in and on average in same store sales growth or contraction results from the combination of the increasing use by consumers of bank cards for the purchase of goods and services at the point of sale  and sales growth or contraction experienced by our retained sme bank card merchants 
the following table compares our same store sales growth or contraction for the  and full years and by quarter during and by full year same store sales growth contraction full year full year full year by quarter and first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter we attribute the declining rates of same store sales growth percentages in our sme business  including the increasing contraction rates we experienced during the second  third and fourth quarters of  to declining economic conditions including impacts from severely contracted credit markets  a weak housing market  historically low consumer and investor confidence and a soft labor market leading to higher unemployment rates 
management believes that all of these factors have negatively impacted consumer confidence  disposable income  spending and behavior  which has impacted the businesses of our sme merchants 
in addition  management believes that the current challenging economic conditions and depressed consumer confidence  as well as the general contraction in credit availability  may continue to negatively impact our business 
we also derive recurring revenue from our payroll processing services  american express and discover processing  and maintenance fees on micro payment and campus solutions 
other revenues include sales of card processing and micro payment equipment and fees for additional services we provide  such as fees for handling merchants chargebacks 
we provide payroll processing services throughout the united states 
at december   we processed payroll for  customers  an increase of from  payroll customers at december  processing system intrusion on january   we publicly announced the processing system intrusion 
the processing system intrusion involved malicious software that appears to have been used to collect in transit  unencrypted payment card data while it was being processed by us during the transaction authorization process 
such data is not required to be encrypted while in transit under current 
table of contents payment card industry guidelines 
we had received confirmation of our compliance with the payment card initiative data security standard pci dss from a third party assessor each year since the standard was announced  including most recently in april card data that was affected by the processing system intrusion included card numbers  expiration dates  and certain other information from the magnetic stripe on the back of the payment card including  for a small percentage of transactions  the cardholder s name 
however  the cardholder information that we process does not include addresses or social security numbers 
also  we believe that no unencrypted pin data was captured 
we believe the breach has been contained and did not extend beyond our investigation of the processing system intrusion is ongoing 
we have been advised by visa inc that based on visa s investigation of the processing system intrusion  visa believes we are in violation of the visa operating regulations and that  based on that belief  visa has removed us from visa published list of pci dss compliant service providers until such time as we are re certified as pci dss compliant and the assessor s report attesting to such re certification has been reviewed and approved by visa  intends to seek to impose fines on our sponsor banks  which fines if successfully imposed our sponsor banks could in turn seek to recover from us  intends to place us in a probationary status during the two years following our re certification as being pci dss compliant  during which time our failure to comply with the probationary requirements set forth by visa or with the visa operating regulations may result in visa seeking to impose further risk conditions on us  including but not limited to our disconnection from visanet or our disqualification from the visa payment system  and intends to treat some or all of the visa accounts that visa considers to have been placed at risk of compromise in the processing system intrusion as being eligible for visa s account data compromise recovery and data compromise recovery solution processes  which processes could result in visa s seeking to recover from our sponsor banks and our sponsor banks in turn seeking to recover from us amounts in respect of fraud losses and operating expenses that visa believes visa issuers to have incurred by reason of the processing system intrusion 
while we have determined that the processing system intrusion has triggered a loss contingency  to date  an unfavorable outcome is not believed by us to be probable on those claims that are pending or have been threatened against us  or that we consider to be probable of assertion against us  and we do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the loss we would incur in the event of an unfavorable outcome on any such claim 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  no reserve liability has been recorded with respect to any such claims as of december  as more information becomes available  if we should determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable on such a claim and that the amount of such unfavorable outcome is reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve for the claim in question 
if and when we record such a reserve  it could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
costs we incurred related to investigations and remedial actions performed in december were not significant 
amounts we expect to incur for investigations  remedial actions  legal fees  and crisis management services related to the processing system intrusion that will be performed after december  will be recognized as incurred 
such costs could be material and are expected to adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
financial highlights for  we recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  increases of and  respectively  from million  or per diluted share  in the increases were primarily driven by revenues added by the growth in our transaction processing volume and efficiencies realized in processing and servicing costs 
net income for included pre tax charges of million for losses on investments 
net income for included pre tax charges of million for the write off of an investment  million to record the costs associated with exiting our old service center  and million to record our liability from a legal proceeding under an indemnification we had provided to an insurer 
the following is a summary of our financial results for new installed gross margin increased by over bank card processing volume during increased to billion from billion during  however  included billion of processing volume from network services 
excluding network services processing volume  we received percentage based revenues on processing volume of billion  an increase of over the billion processed in this increase in sme bank card processing volume was primarily attributable to a net increase in sme merchant accounts and installed gross margin 
additionally  network services generated revenues on the million transactions it settled  and the billion transactions it authorized through its front end card processing systems since we acquired that business 
net revenue  which we define as total revenues less interchange fees and dues  assessments and fees  increased to million during from million during the increase in net revenue was driven by the year over year increases in active merchants and processing volume  as well as the addition of revenues from network services 
excluding network services revenue  our net revenue grew by during our processing and servicing costs for increased to of our total revenues  from of total revenues for the increase in processing and servicing expense included million for network services and an increase of million in merchant losses during the year ended december  as we incurred increased losses primarily related to merchants that had gone out of business due to weak economic conditions 
the increase was also due to costs associated with the increased bank card processing volume  equipment costs of sales and the costs of operating our service center  particularly the costs of support personnel including field account managers and depreciation and amortization 
our income from operations  which we also refer to as operating income  grew to million for from million for our operating margin  which is measured as operating income 
table of contents divided by net revenue  was for  compared to for network services operating margin is significantly lower than that of our historic business  and will materially reduce our combined operating margins in future periods 
our effective income tax rate for was  which compares to an effective tax rate of for the higher effective tax rate for the year was due to increases in state income tax rates 
components of revenues and expenses revenues 
our revenues fall into three categories gross card processing revenue  payroll processing revenue and equipment related income 
our gross card processing revenue primarily consists of discount  per transaction network services prices its card processing fees entirely on a per transaction basis and periodic primarily monthly fees from the processing of bank card transactions  primarily visa and mastercard transactions  for merchants and authorization of transactions by network services 
these fees are negotiated by our relationship managers with each merchant 
gross card processing revenue also includes american express and discover fees  customer service fees  fees for processing chargebacks  termination fees on terminated contracts  check processing fees  gift and loyalty card fees and other miscellaneous revenue 
revenues are recorded at the time service is provided 
payroll processing revenue includes fees charged by our subsidiary  heartland payroll company  for payroll processing services  including check printing  direct deposit  related federal  state and local tax deposits and providing accounting documentation and interest income earned on funds held for customers 
revenues are recorded at the time service is provided 
equipment related income includes revenues from the sale  rental and deployment of bank card and check processing terminals 
since january   our equipment related income also includes revenues from the sale of hardware  software and associated services for prepaid card and stored value card payment systems 
beginning october   we added revenues from the sale of hardware  software and associated services for campus payment solutions to our equipment related income 
equipment revenues are recorded at the time of shipment  or the provision of service 
most of these revenue items will tend to grow with our merchant growth 
expenses 
our most significant expense is interchange fees  which are set by the visa and mastercard card networks  and are paid to the card issuing banks 
for our sme bank card processing  we do not offset bank card processing revenues and interchange fees because our business practice is to advance the interchange fees to most of our merchants when settling their daily transactions thus paying the full amount of the transaction to the merchant  and then to collect our full discount fees from our merchants on the first business day of the next month 
as network services does not advance interchange fees to its merchants  we record its portion of our processing revenues net of interchange fees 
interchange fees are calculated as a percentage of the dollar volume processed plus a per transaction fee 
we also pay visa and mastercard network dues  assessments and fees  which are a combination of a percentage of the dollar volume processed and per transaction fees 
interchange fees and dues  assessments and fees are recognized at the time transactions are processed 
it is our policy to pass along to our merchants any changes in interchange fees and card network dues  assessments and fees 
since the card networks regularly adjust those rates  our gross processing revenue will increase or decrease  but all the impact will be paid to the card issuing banks and our income from operations will not be affected 
costs of services also include processing and servicing costs  customer acquisition costs  and depreciation and amortization 
processing and servicing costs include processing costs  which are either paid to third parties  including our bank sponsors  or represent the cost of our own authorization capture and accounting settlement systems 
during  third party costs represented about of our processing costs and increased due to our addition of network services  with internal costs representing the remainder 
during  third party costs represented about of our processing costs  compared to during approximately of our third party processing costs in were paid to alliance data systems corporation for processing network services transactions 
approximately  and  respectively  of our third party processing costs in  and were paid to tsys acquiring solutions  residual commission payments to our relationship managers  sales managers  trade associations  agent banks and value added resellers  which are a percentage of the gross margin we generated from our merchant contracts during the accounting period  
table of contents the costs of operating our service center  including telecommunications costs  personnel costs  occupancy costs  losses due to merchant defaults  depreciation and amortization  and other direct merchant servicing costs  and the costs of bank card terminals  prepaid card and stored value hardware deployed  and merchant supplies 
customer acquisition costs reflect the amortization over the initial three year contract term of the cash signing bonus paid and the deferred acquisition costs for vested relationship managers and sales managers  as well as changes in the accrued buyout liability  which reflect the impact of buying out residual commissions see critical accounting estimates accrued buyout liability and volume attrition 
depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we have made significant capital expenditures for computer hardware and software and such costs are generally depreciated over three to five years 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and wages and other administrative expenses 
the two most significant elements in these expenses are our information technology infrastructure costs and our marketing expenses 
beginning january   general and administrative expenses also include expenses recorded for share based compensation under sfas no 
r 
other income expense consists of interest income on cash and investments  the interest cost on our borrowings  losses on investments  the gains or losses on the disposal or write down of property  plant and equipment and other non operating income or expense items 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the critical accounting estimates described here are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations  including those whose application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the line items on our income statement and balance sheet impacted by management s estimates are described below 
revenues historically  we have paid to of our gross processing revenue as interchange fees to the card issuing banks 
certain of our competitors report their revenue net of interchange fees 
this is because the issuing banks make their payments to these competitors net of those interchange fees  and these acquirers pay this reduced amount to their merchants 
we do not offset gross processing revenue and interchange fees because our business practice is to fund the interchange fee or to arrange for our sponsor bank to advance the interchange fees to most of our merchants when settling their transactions thus paying the full amount of the transaction to the merchant  and then to collect our full discount fees from our merchants on the first business day of the next month 
we believe this policy aids in new business generation  as our merchants benefit from bookkeeping simplicity 
however  this results in our carrying a large receivable from our merchants at each period end  and a corresponding but smaller payable to our sponsor bank  both of which are settled on the first business day after the period end 
as we are at risk for the receivables  we record the associated revenues on a gross processing revenue basis in our consolidated income statements 
since the acquisition of network services  we record a portion of our processing revenues net of interchange fees because the daily cash settlement with the network services merchants is net of interchange fees 
capitalized customer acquisition costs capitalized customer acquisition costs consist of up front signing bonuses paid to relationship managers and sales managers  referred to as the salesperson or salespersons  for the establishment of new merchant relationships  and deferred acquisition cost representing the estimated cost of buying out the commissions of vested salespersons at some point in the future 
pursuant to staff accounting bulletin topic  
table of contents revenue recognition  and the financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  capitalized customer acquisition costs represent incremental  direct customer acquisition costs that are recoverable through gross margins associated with sme merchant contracts 
the capitalized customer acquisition costs are amortized using a method which approximates a proportional revenue approach over the initial three year term of the merchant contract 
the amount of the up front signing bonus paid for new sme bank card  payroll and check processing accounts is based on the estimated gross margin for the first year of the merchant contract 
the gross signing bonuses paid during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the signing bonus paid  amount capitalized  and related amortization are adjusted at the end of the first year to reflect the actual gross margin generated by the merchant contract during that year 
the net signing bonus adjustments made during  and were positive million  million and million  respectively 
positive signing bonus adjustments occur when the actual gross margin generated by the merchant contract during the first year exceeds the estimated gross margin for that year  resulting in the underpayment of the up front signing bonus 
negative signing bonus adjustments could result from prior overpayments of up front signing bonuses  and would be recovered from the relevant salesperson 
the amount of signing bonuses paid which remained subject to adjustment at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the deferred acquisition cost component is accrued for vested salespersons over the first year of bank card merchant processing  consistent with the build up in the accrued buyout liability  which is described below 
management evaluates the capitalized customer acquisition costs for impairment at each balance sheet date by comparing  on a pooled basis by vintage month of origination  the expected future net cash flows from underlying merchant relationships to the carrying amount of the capitalized customer acquisition costs 
if the estimated future net cash flows are lower than the recorded carrying amount  indicating an impairment of the value of the capitalized customer acquisition costs  the impairment loss will be charged to operations 
we have not recognized an impairment loss in  or accrued buyout liability we pay our salespersons residual commissions based on the gross margin generated from the monthly processing activity of sme merchants signed by them 
we refer to these residual commissions as the owned portion of such commissions  or portfolio equity 
the salesperson has no obligation to perform additional services for the merchant for so long as the merchant continues processing with us 
we accrue the buyout liability  which represents the estimated current settlement cost of buying out all vested and expected to vest salespersons for the owned portion of such commissions 
we also record a deferred acquisition cost asset related to those buyouts  and amortize that asset as an expense over the initial year contract term 
we consider a salesperson to be vested once they have established merchant relationships that generate the equivalent of  of monthly gross margin 
vested status entitles the salesperson to his or her residual commissions for as long as the merchant processes with us  even if the salesperson is no longer employed by us 
the accrued buyout liability is based on the sme merchants we have under contract at the balance sheet date  the gross margin we generated from those accounts in the prior twelve months  the owned commission rate  and the fixed buyout multiple of times the commissions 
the liability related to a new merchant is therefore zero when the merchant is installed  and increases over the twelve months following the installation date 
for unvested salespersons  the accrued buyout liability is accrued over the expected vesting period  however  no deferred acquisition cost is capitalized as future services are required in order to vest 
in calculating the accrued buyout liability for unvested salespersons  we have assumed that of unvested salespersons will vest in the future  which represents our historical vesting rate 
a increase to in the expected vesting rate would have increased the accrued buyout liability for unvested salespersons by million at december  and buyout payments made to salespersons reduce the outstanding accrued buyout liability 
given our view of the duration of the cash flows associated with a pool of merchant contracts  we believe that the benefits of 
table of contents such buyouts significantly exceed the cost  which typically represents to years of commissions 
if the cash flows associated with a pool of bought out contracts does not exceed this cost  we will incur an economic loss on our decision to buyout the contracts 
during  and  we made buyout payments of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to make significant buyout payments in the future  subject to available cash  as such buyouts reduce the monthly payments we will have to make to our salespersons for such merchants in the future 
reserve for processing system intrusion the processing system intrusion requires us to make assumptions and estimates concerning the outcomes and related costs and losses in connection with various lawsuits  claims  and investigations 
we make our estimates of costs based on our best judgments and anticipated outcomes of these lawsuits  claims  and investigations 
while we have determined that the processing system intrusion has triggered a loss contingency  to date an unfavorable outcome is not believed by us to be probable on those claims that are pending or have been threatened against us  or that we consider to be probable of assertion against us  and we do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the loss we would incur in the event of an unfavorable outcome on any such claim 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  no reserve liability has been recorded with respect to any such claims as of december  as more information becomes available  if we should determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable on such a claim and that the amount of such unfavorable outcome is reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve for the claim in question 
if and when we record such a reserve  it could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
costs we incurred related to investigations and remedial actions performed in december were not significant 
amounts we expect to incur for investigations  remedial actions  legal fees  and crisis management services related to the processing system intrusion that will be performed after december  will be recognized as incurred 
such costs are expected to be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
merchant deposits and loss reserves disputes between a cardholder and a merchant periodically arise as a result of  among other things  the cardholder s dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services 
such disputes may not be resolved in the merchant s favor 
in these cases  the transaction is charged back to the merchant  which means the purchase price is refunded to the customer by the card issuing bank and charged to the merchant 
if the merchant is unable to fund the refund  we must do so 
we also bear the risk of reject losses arising from the fact that we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period 
if the merchant has gone out of business during such period  we may be unable to collect such fees 
we maintain cash deposits or require the pledge of a letter of credit from certain merchants  generally those with higher average transaction size where the card is not present when the charge is made or the product or service is delivered after the charge is made  in order to offset potential contingent liabilities such as chargebacks and reject losses that would arise if the merchant went out of business 
at december  and  we held sme merchant deposits totaling million and million  respectively 
most chargeback and reject losses are charged to processing and servicing as they are incurred 
however  we also maintain a loss reserve against losses including major fraud losses  which are both less predictable and involve larger amounts 
the loss reserve was established using historical loss rates  applied to recent bank card processing volume 
at december  and  our loss reserve totaled  and  respectively 
aggregate bank card merchant losses  including losses charged to operations and the loss reserve  were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
as percentages of sme processing volume  in  and  we experienced losses of  and  respectively 
chargebacks originating from large national merchant bank card processing are processed and carried by fifth third bank  which is our third party outsourced processor for settling large national merchant accounts 
stock options we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r on january  this statement revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and its related implementation guidance 
the most significant change resulting from this statement is the requirement for public companies to expense employee share based payments under the fair value method 
pursuant to sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition 
table of contents method  as provided by sfas no 
r 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
under this transitional method  the company is required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption using grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards using the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
in the third quarter of  our board of directors approved a performance based stock option program 
under this program  we granted million performance based stock options to our employees 
these stock options were granted to those employees who the board of directors determined could have significant impact on successfully integrating the recently acquired network services business and effectively executing our growth plan 
these stock options have a five year term and will vest in equal amounts in  and only if over the term of the stock options  both of the following performance conditions are achieved consolidated net revenue grows at a compound annual rate of at least  and fully diluted eps grows at a compound annual rate of at least 
management believes that achieving these performance conditions is not more likely than not to occur therefore  no share based compensation expense has been recorded for these stock options in the evaluation of the likelihood of achieving these performance conditions will be repeated quarterly  and at such point that vesting of some or all of the options becomes more likely than not  share based compensation expense will be recorded 
we estimate the grant date fair value of the stock options we issue using a black scholes valuation model 
our assumption for expected volatility is based on our historical volatility for those option grants whose expected life fall within a period we have sufficient historical volatility data related to market trading of our own common stock 
for those option grants whose expected life is longer than we have sufficient historical volatility data related to market trading of our own common stock  we determine an expected volatility assumption by referencing the average volatility experienced by a group of our public company peers 
for plain vanilla stock options  we estimate the expected life of a stock option based on the simplified method as provided by the staff of the sec in staff accounting bulletins and the simplified method is used because  at this point  we do not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns 
for the performance based options  the expected life is estimated based on the average of three possible performance condition outcomes 
our dividend yield assumption is based on actual dividends expected to be paid over the expected life of the stock option 
our risk free interest rate assumption for stock options granted is determined by using us treasury rates of the same period as the expected option term of each stock option 
the weighted average fair value of options we granted during  and were  and  respectively 
the fair value of options granted during  and was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  expected volatility expected life to years to years to years expected dividends risk free interest rate prior to adopting sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method under apb no

table of contents additionally  sfas no 
r amended sfas no

liquidity and capital resources general 
liquidity and capital resource management is a process focused on providing the funding we need to meet our short and long term cash and working capital needs 
we have used our funding sources to build our merchant portfolio and our technology platforms with the expectation that these investments will generate cash flows sufficient to cover our working capital needs and other anticipated needs for capital 
our cash requirements include funding payments to salespersons for signing bonuses  residual commissions and residual buyouts  paying interest expense and other operating expenses  including taxes  constructing our new service center and investing in building our technology infrastructure 
we expect that our future cash requirements will include material amounts required to defend against claims arising from the processing system intrusion and could include material amounts required to resolve such claims 
at times  we have used cash to repurchase our common stock 
we could in the future use cash for other unspecified acquisitions of related businesses or assets 
other than borrowings we used to fund our may acquisition of network services  we fund our cash needs primarily with cash flow from our operating activities and through our agreements with our sponsor banks to fund sme merchant advances 
additionally  we could seek to raise cash by financing our owned service center in jeffersonville  indiana 
we believe that our current cash and investment balances  cash generated from operations and our agreements with our sponsor banks to fund sme merchant advances will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated needs for operating capital for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may face a liquidity challenge  particularly in light of current conditions in the financial markets  if we are unable to meet cash requirements arising from the processing system intrusion from our operating cash flow

also contributing favorably to cash provided by operating activities was an increase in due to sponsor banks 
the increase in the amounts due to sponsor banks was mostly due to using available cash  which otherwise would have been available to fund merchant advances  to fund the acquisitions of network services  cpos and chockstone  as well as treasury stock purchases during the improvement over in cash provided by operating activities was also due to an increase in the amount due to sponsor banks and increased net income for  as adjusted for depreciation and amortization  additions to loss reserves  provision for doubtful receivables  share based compensation expense  other non cash charges and deferred taxes

on august   our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional  shares of our common stock in the open market using proceeds from the issuance of stock options 
on may   the board of directors eliminated the restriction in the august  repurchase authorization which required management to use only proceeds from the issuance of stock options for repurchases  and increased the total remaining authorized number of shares to be repurchased to 
table of contents  we intend to use these authorizations to repurchase shares opportunistically as a means of offsetting dilution from shares issued upon the exercise of options under employee benefit plans  and to use cash to take advantage of declines in the company s stock price 
we have no obligation to repurchase shares under the authorization  and the specific timing and amount of the stock repurchase will vary based on market conditions  securities law limitations and other factors 
the stock repurchase will be executed utilizing general corporate funds

contractual obligations 
the visa and mastercard networks generally allow chargebacks up to four months after the later of the date the transaction is processed or the delivery of the product or service to the cardholder 
if the merchant incurring the chargeback is unable to fund the refund to the card issuing bank  we must do so 
as the majority of our sme transactions involve the delivery of the product or service at the time of the transaction  a good basis to estimate our exposure to chargebacks is the last four months bank card processing volume on our sme portfolio  which was billion  billion and billion for the four months ended december   and  respectively 
however  during the four months ended december   and  we were presented with million  million and million  respectively  of chargebacks by issuing banks 
in  and  we incurred merchant credit losses related to chargebacks of million  million and million  respectively  on total sme dollar volume processed of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
these credit losses are included in processing and servicing expense in our consolidated statements of income

our agreements with third party processors require us to submit a minimum monthly number of transactions or volume for processing 
if we submit a number of transactions or volume that is lower than the minimum  we are required to pay the third party processors the fees that they would have received if we had submitted the required minimum number or volume of transactions 
b these amounts relate to contractual commitments we have for constructing our new service center in jeffersonville  indiana 
additional contractual commitments will be entered into as we progress with the development of this site 
through december   we have spent approximately million of our cash on our new service center  including million to acquire land  and over the next twelve months we expect to spend approximately million more on its development  including the contractual obligations in the above table 
in addition  we record a payable to our sponsor banks each month in conjunction with our monthly processing activities 
this amount was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
this amount is repaid on the first business day of the following month out of the fees collected from our merchants 
unrecognized tax benefits 
at december   we had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million 
see critical accounting estimates income taxes 
as of december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority  hence the unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above commitment and contractual obligations table

legal and regulatory considerations processing system intrusion legal proceedings to date  we have had several lawsuits filed against us and we expect additional lawsuits will be filed 
these include lawsuits which assert claims against us by cardholders including various putative class actions seeking in the aggregate to represent all cardholders in the united states whose transaction information is alleged to have been placed at risk in the course of the processing system intrusion  and banks that issued payment cards to cardholders whose transaction information is alleged to have been placed at risk in the course of the processing system intrusion including various putative class actions seeking to represent all financial institutions that issued payment cards to cardholders whose transaction information is alleged to have been placed at risk in the course of the processing system intrusion  seeking damages allegedly arising out of the processing system intrusion and other related relief 
the actions generally assert various common law claims such as claims for negligence and breach of contract  as well as  in some cases  statutory claims such as violation of the fair credit reporting act  state data breach notification statutes  and state unfair and deceptive practices statutes 
the putative cardholder class actions seek various forms of relief including damages  injunctive relief  multiple or punitive damages  attorney s fees and costs 
the putative financial institution class actions seek compensatory damages  including recovery of the cost of issuance of replacement cards and losses by reason of unauthorized transactions  as well as injunctive relief  attorney s fees and costs 
we have filed a motion with the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation seeking to have these cases consolidated for pre trial proceedings before the united states district court for the southern district of texas 
the putative consumer class actions and putative financial institution class actions filed against us through march  are described in legal proceedings processing system intrusion legal proceedings 
a putative class action was commenced against us and certain of our executive officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with our disclosures relative to the processing system intrusion and the alleged trading of our securities by four heartland insiders 
this case  davis v 
heartland payment systems  inc  robert o 
carr and robert hb baldwin  jr  was commenced on march  in the united states district court for the district of new jersey 
the plaintiff in the putative federal securities law class action seeks to represent all purchasers of our securities between august  and february  and seeks to recover losses such purchasers allegedly incurred by reason of their purchases  as well as related costs and expenses 
we have been advised by the sec that it has commenced an informal inquiry and we have been advised by the united states attorney for the district of new jersey that it has commenced an investigation  in each case to determine whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws in connection with our disclosure of the processing systems intrusion and the alleged trading in our securities by certain of our employees  including certain executive officers 
we have been contacted by the federal financial institutions examination council and informed that it will be making inquiries into the processing system intrusion  and the federal trade commission  by letter dated february   has requested that we provide information about our information security practices 
additionally  we have received written or telephonic inquiries relating to the processing system intrusion from a number of state attorneys general s offices  including a civil investigative demand from the louisiana department of justice office of the attorney general  the canadian privacy commission  and other government officials 
we are cooperating with the government officials in response to each of these inquiries 
we expect that additional lawsuits may be filed against us relating to the processing system intrusion and that additional inquiries from governmental agencies may be received or investigations may be commenced 
although we intend to defend the lawsuits  investigations and inquiries described above vigorously  we cannot predict the outcome of such lawsuits  investigations and inquiries 
apart from damages claimed in such lawsuits and in other lawsuits relating to the processing system intrusion that may be filed  we may be subject to fines or other obligations as a result of the government inquiries and investigations described above and additional governmental inquiries or investigations relating to the processing system intrusion that may be commenced 
the card brands may also assert claims seeking to impose fines  penalties  and or other assessments against us or our sponsor banks who would seek indemnification from us pursuant to our agreements with them based upon the processing system intrusion 
in that regard  we have been advised by visa that based on visa s investigation of the processing system intrusion visa believes we are in violation of the visa operating regulations and that  based on that belief  visa has removed us from visa s published list of pci dss compliant service providers until such time as we are re certified as pci dss compliant and the assessor s report attesting to such re certification has been reviewed and approved by visa  intends to seek to impose fines on our sponsor banks  which fines if successfully imposed our sponsor banks could in turn seek to recover from us  intends to place us in a probationary status during the two years following our re certification as being pci dss compliant  during which time our failure to comply with the probationary requirements set forth by visa or with the visa operating regulations may result in visa seeking to impose further risk conditions on us  including but not limited to our disconnection from visanet or our disqualification from the visa payment system  and intends to treat some or all of the visa accounts that visa considers to have been placed at risk of compromise in the processing system intrusion as being eligible for visa s account data compromise recovery and data compromise recovery solution processes  which processes could result in visa s seeking to recover from our sponsor banks and our sponsor banks in turn seeking to recover from us amounts in respect of fraud losses and operating expenses that visa believes visa issuers to have incurred by reason of the processing system intrusion 
we expect the other card brands will assert claims seeking to impose fines  penalties  and or other assessments against us or our sponsor banks who would seek indemnification from us pursuant to our agreements with them based upon the processing system intrusion 
by these claims  we expect the other card brands to seek to recover from us  or from our sponsor banks who would in turn seek to recover from us  assessments in respect of fraud losses and operating expenses including card reissuance costs and non ordinary course account monitoring expenses that the other card brands believe either themselves or their issuers to have incurred by reason of the processing system intrusion  as well as fines and or penalties by reason of our alleged failure to comply with the other card brands operating regulations 
the amounts of the card brand claims described above are expected to be material  and the amounts we are required to pay to defend against and or resolve those claims are expected to be material could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
while we have determined that the processing system intrusion has triggered a loss contingency  to date an unfavorable outcome is not believed by us to be probable on those claims that are pending or have been threatened against us  or that we consider to be probable of assertion against us  and we do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the loss we would incur in the event of an unfavorable outcome on any such claim 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  no reserve liability has been recorded with respect to any such claim as of december  as more information becomes available  if we should determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable on such a claim and that the amount of such unfavorable outcome is reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve for the claim in question 
if and when we record such a reserve  it could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
costs we incurred related to investigations and remedial actions performed in december were not significant 
amounts we expect to incur for investigations  remedial actions  legal fees  and crisis management services related to the processing system intrusion that will be performed after december  will be recognized as incurred 
such costs are expected to be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
although we have insurance that we believe may cover some of the costs and losses that we may incur in connection with the above described pending and potential lawsuits  inquiries  investigations and claims  we cannot now confirm that such coverage will  in fact  be provided or the extent of such coverage  if it is provided 

table of contents other legal proceedings on december   a putative class action was filed against us in the superior court of california  county of san diego  ryan mcinerney  hossein vazir zand v 
heartland payment systems  inc the plaintiffs purport to represent a putative class of individuals who allegedly were not reimbursed by us for business expenses and whose compensation was allegedly reduced for their costs of doing business 
the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages  penalties  injunctive and declaratory relief  and attorney s fees and costs 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are party to various legal actions  which we believe are incidental to the operation of our business 
we believe that the outcome of the proceedings to which we are currently a party will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
we have interest rate risk related to our payable to our sponsor banks 
during each month  keybank and heartland bank advance interchange fees to most of our merchants 
we fund these advances first by applying a portion of our available cash and then by incurring a significant payable to our sponsor banks  bearing interest at the prime rate 
at december   our payable to our sponsor banks was million 
this payable is repaid on the first business day of the following month out of fees collected from our merchants 
during the quarter ended december  the average daily interest bearing balance of that payable was approximately million 
the outstanding balance of our payable to our sponsor banks is directly related to our bank card processing volume and also will fluctuate depending on the amount of our available cash 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our average payable to sponsor banks would result in a change of approximately  in annual pre tax income 
we also incur interest rate risk on borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement

while the bulk of our cash and cash equivalents are held in checking accounts or money market funds  we do hold certain fixed income investments with maturities within three years 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an increase of approximately  in annual pre tax income from money market fund holdings  but a decrease in the value of fixed rate investments of approximately  a hypothetical basis point decrease in short term interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately  in annual pre tax income from money market funds  but an increase in the value of fixed rate instruments of approximately  foreign currency risk 
while substantially all of our business is conducted in us dollars  our canadian processing subsidiary  cpos  conducts its operations in canadian dollars 
consequently  a portion of cpos revenues and expenses may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates on assets and liabilities related to our cpos subsidiary 
we have not hedged our translation risk on foreign currency exposure 
for year ended december   foreign currency exposures had an immaterial impact on our revenues and our net income
