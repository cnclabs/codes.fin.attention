our proved reserves are estimates 
any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or assumptions underlying our reserve estimates could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

table of contents there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control that could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated 
the reserve information included or incorporated by reference in this report represents estimates prepared by our internal engineers 
the procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by an independent petroleum engineering firm 
estimation of reserves is not an exact science 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  any of which may cause these estimates to vary considerably from actual results  such as historical production from an area compared with production from similar producing areas  assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs and capital expenditures  and estimates of future severance and excise taxes  workover and remedial costs 
estimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected future net cash flows prepared or audited by different engineers  or by the same engineers at different times  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and the variance may be material 
the net present values referred to in this report should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
unless we replace our reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in general  the volume of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful development and exploration activities 
thus  our future oil and natural gas production and  therefore  our cash flow and income are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
however  we cannot assure you that our future acquisition  development and exploration activities will result in any specific amount of additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of a number of factors 
these factors include recoverable reserves  future oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities  title issues and other factors 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with such assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe is thorough 
however  there is no assurance that such a review will reveal all existing or potential problems or allow us to fully assess the deficiencies and capabilities of such properties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties at acceptable prices because the competition for producing oil and natural gas properties is intense and many of our competitors have financial and other resources that are substantially greater than those available to us 
there is a possibility that we will lose the leases to our oil and gas properties 
our oil and gas revenues are generated through leases to the oil and gas properties 
these leases are conditioned on the performance of certain obligations  primarily the obligation to produce oil and or gas or engage in operations designed to result in the production of oil and gas 
if production ceases and operations are not commenced within a specified time  the lease may be lost 
the loss of our leases may have a material impact on our revenues 
in the case of israeli based properties  we have licenses that  subject to certain conditions  may result in leases being granted 
the leases are subject to certain obligations and are renewable at the discretion of various governmental authorities 
as such  we may not be able to fulfill our obligations under the leases  which may result in the modification  or cancellation of such leases or such leases may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms different from the current leases 
the modification or cancellation of our leases may have a material impact on our revenues 
our business is highly competitive 
the oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive in many respects  including identification of attractive oil and natural gas properties for acquisition  drilling and development  securing financing for such activities and obtaining the necessary equipment and personnel to conduct such operations and activities 
in seeking suitable opportunities  we compete with a number of other companies  including large oil and natural gas companies and other independent operators with greater financial resources  larger numbers of personnel and facilities  and with more expertise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with these entities 
our business may be affected by oil and gas price volatility 
our revenues  profitability and future growth and the carrying value of our properties depend substantially on prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we will be able to borrow under our senior credit agreements will be subject to periodic redetermination based in part on current oil and natural gas prices and on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce and have an adverse effect on the value of our properties 

table of contents historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
among the factors that can cause volatility are the domestic and foreign supply of  and demand for oil and natural gas  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and other producing countries to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  political instability  armed conflict or terrorist attacks  whether or not in oil or natural gas producing regions  the growth of consumer product demand in emerging markets  such as india and china  labor unrest in oil and natural gas producing regions  weather conditions  including hurricanes and other natural occurrences that affect the supply and or demand of oil and natural gas  the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels  the price and level of foreign imports of oil  natural gas and ngls  and worldwide economic conditions 
our commercial lenders have liens on substantially all of our oil and gas assets in the united states and could foreclose in the event that we default under our credit facilities 
under the terms of our credit facilities with our commercial lenders  our lenders have a first priority lien on substantially all of our oil and gas assets in the united states 
if we default under the credit facility  our lender would be entitled to  among other things  foreclose on our assets in order to satisfy our obligations under the credit facility 
our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas production  we have entered into oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our anticipated production and we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our actual production is less than hedged volumes  there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  or the counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts 

table of contents the current economic crisis may have a negative impact on the liquidity of the counterparties to our hedging arrangements  which increases the risk of those counterparties failing to perform under those agreements 
if those parties do fail to perform  we will be exposed to the price risks we had sought to mitigate and our operating results  financial position and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 
as of december  approximately   and of our forecasted oil production and natural gas liquids hedged for   and respectively and approximately   and of our forecasted gas production hedged for the same time frame 
we have no means to market our oil and gas production without the assistance of third parties 
the marketability of our production depends upon the proximity of our reserves to  and the capacity of  facilities and third party services  including oil and natural gas gathering systems  pipelines  trucking or terminal facilities  and processing facilities 
the unavailability or lack of capacity of such services and facilities could impair or delay the production of new wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
a shut in  delay or discontinuance could adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  regulation of oil and natural gas production transportation in the united states or in other countries may affect its ability to produce and market our oil and natural gas on a profitable basis 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies and or qualified personnel 
during these periods  the costs and delivery times of rigs  equipment and supplies are substantially greater 
in addition  the demand for  and wage rates of  qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases 
increasing levels of exploration and production in response to strong prices of oil and natural gas may increase the demand for oilfield services  and the costs of these services may increase  while the quality of these services may suffer 
our oil and natural gas activities are subject to various risks that are beyond our control 
our operations are subject to many risks and hazards incident to exploring and drilling for  producing  transporting  marketing and selling oil and natural gas 
although we may take precautionary measures  many of these risks and hazards are beyond our control and unavoidable under the circumstances 
many of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses  the ability of certain of our wells to produce oil and natural gas in commercial quantities  the rate of production and the economics of the development of  and our investment in the prospects in which we have or will acquire an interest 
any of these risks and hazards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
such risks and hazards include human error  accidents  labor force and other factors beyond our control that may cause personal injuries or death to persons and destruction or damage to equipment and facilities  blowouts  fires  hurricanes  pollution and equipment failures that may result in damage to or destruction of wells  producing formations  production facilities and equipment  unavailability of materials and equipment  engineering and construction delays  unanticipated transportation costs and delays  unfavorable weather conditions  hazards resulting from unusual or unexpected geological or environmental conditions  environmental regulations and requirements  accidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials  such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids  into the environment  changes in laws and regulations  including laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas activities or markets for the oil and natural gas produced  fluctuations in supply and demand for oil and natural gas causing variations of the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production  and the availability of alternative fuels and the price at which they become available 

table of contents we do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities 
the exploration for  and production of  natural gas and crude oil can be hazardous  involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts  fires and loss of well control  which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities  injure or kill people  and damage property and the environment 
moreover  our onshore operations are subject to customary perils  including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions 
we maintain insurance against many  but not all  potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable 
the occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events would reduce the funds available to us for our exploration  development and production activities and could  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective  the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our share price may suffer 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the us securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting 
to comply with this statute  we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting and our management is required to issue a report concerning our internal controls over financial reporting in this annual report on form k for the effectiveness of our fiscal year ended december  our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for our annual report on form k for our fiscal year ending december  the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal controls over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation  testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules 
we have discovered certain deficiencies in the design and or operation of our internal controls that could adversely affect our ability to record  process  summarize and report financial data 
we have invested and will continue to invest significant resources in this process 
we are uncertain as to what impact this conclusion that deficiencies exist in our internal controls over financial reporting would have on the trading price of our common stock 
governmental and environmental regulations could adversely affect our business 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations on taxation  the exploration for and development  production and marketing of oil and natural gas and safety matters 
many laws and regulations require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells  rates of production  prevention of waste  unitization and pooling of properties and other matters 
these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning our oil and natural gas wells and other facilities 
in addition  these laws and regulations  and any others that are passed by the jurisdictions where we have production  could limit the total number of wells drilled or the allowable production from successful wells  which could limit our revenues 
our operations are also subject to complex environmental laws and regulations adopted by the various jurisdictions in which we have or expect to have oil and natural gas operations 
we could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil  natural gas or other pollutants into the air  soil or water  including responsibility for remedial costs 
we could potentially discharge these materials into the environment in any of the following ways from a well or drilling equipment at a drill site  from gathering systems  pipelines  transportation facilities and storage tanks  damage to oil and natural gas wells resulting from accidents during normal operations  and blowouts  hurricanes and explosions 
assets we acquire may prove to be worth less than we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities 
our recent growth is due significantly to acquisitions of producing properties and underdeveloped leaseholds 
we expect acquisitions may also contribute to our future growth 
successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors  including estimates of recoverable reserves  exploration potential  future oil and natural gas prices  operating and capital costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with our assessments  we perform a review of the acquired properties which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices 
however  such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in addition  our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
we do not inspect every well 
even when we inspect a well  we do not always discover structural  subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise in the future 
we are generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
normally  we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
because of these factors  we may not be able to acquire oil and natural gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms 
title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects 
we generally conduct due diligence to review title on significant properties that we drill or acquire 
however  there is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure 
additionally  undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage 
generally  under the terms of the operating agreements affecting our properties  any monetary loss is due to title defects is to be borne by all parties to any such agreement in proportion to their interests in such property 
if there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest  we will suffer a financial loss 

table of contents we depend on the skill  ability and decisions of third party operators to a significant extent 
the success of the drilling  development and production of the oil and natural gas properties in which we have or expect to have a non operating working interest is substantially dependent upon the decisions of such third party operators and their diligence to comply with various laws  rules and regulations affecting such properties 
the failure of any third party operator to make decisions  perform their services  discharge their obligations  deal with regulatory agencies  and comply with laws  rules and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations in a proper manner with respect to properties in which we have an interest could result in material adverse consequences to our interest in such properties  including substantial penalties and compliance costs 
such adverse consequences could result in substantial liabilities to us or reduce the value of our properties  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
we depend substantially on the continued presence of key personnel for critical management decisions and industry contacts 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees  particularly with respect to providing the critical management decisions and contacts necessary to manage and maintain growth within a highly competitive industry 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense  particularly in the oil and natural gas industry  and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience 
under these conditions  we could be unable to attract and retain these personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
our operations in israel may be adversely affected by economic and political developments 
we have interests in oil and gas leases and in oil and gas licenses in the waters off israel 
these interests may be adversely affected by political and economic developments  including the following war  terrorist acts and civil disturbances  changes in taxation policies  laws and policies of the us and israel affecting foreign investment  taxation  trade and business conduct  foreign exchange restrictions  international monetary fluctuations and changes in the value of the us dollar  such as the decline of the us dollar and other hazards arising out of israeli governmental sovereignty over areas in which we own oil and gas interests 
rapid growth may place significant demands and resources 
we experienced rapid growth in operations occasioned by the purchase of approximately producing oil and gas wells in march from five states energy company  llc and approximately producing oil and gas wells from gfb and trans republic in march we expect that significant expansion of our operations will continue 
the rapid growth has placed  and the anticipated future growth will continue to place  a significant demand on our managerial  operational and financial resources due to the need to manage relationships with various strategic partners and other third parties  difficulties in hiring and retaining skilled personnel necessary to support our business  the need to merge the operations of the acquired properties into our existing operations  accounting and management systems  the need to train and manage a growing employee base  and pressures for the continued development of our financial and information management systems 
if we have not made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with our expansion or if its systems  procedures or controls are not adequate to support our operations  our business could be adversely impacted 

table of contents members of isramco s management team own a significant amount of common stock  giving them influence or control in corporate transactions and other matters  and the interests of these individuals could differ from those other shareholders 
members of our management team beneficially own approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of march  as a result  these shareholders are in a position to significantly influence or control the outcome of matters requiring a shareholder vote  including the election of directors  the adoption of an amendment to our articles of incorporation or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
our stock price is volatile and could continue to be volatile and has limited liquidity  accordingly  investors may not be able to sell any significant number of shares of our stock at prevailing market prices 
investor interest in our common stock may not lead to the development of an active or liquid trading market 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the stock prices and trading volumes for our stock has fluctuated widely and the average daily trading volume of our stock continues to be limited and may continue for reasons that may be unrelated to business or results of operations 
general economic  market and political conditions could also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and investors may be unable to resell their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price 
as a result of the limited trading in our stock  it may be difficult for investors to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices

unresolved staff comments not applicable item properties oil and gas exploration and production properties and reserves reserve information 
for estimates of isramco s net proved reserves of natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids  see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas  crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers normally vary 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered 
the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based

overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas properties located onshore in the united states 
our properties are primarily located in texas  new mexico and oklahoma 
we act as an operator of certain of these properties 
historically  we have grown through acquisitions  with a focus on properties within our core operating areas that we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of scale to increase production and proved reserves while lowering lease operating costs 
our financial results depend upon many factors  but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire additional properties with existing production 
the amount we realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices  which are affected by changes in market demand and supply  as impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors  and secondarily upon our commodity price hedging activities 
accordingly  finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long term success 
our future drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including drilling results  oil and natural gas prices  the availability and cost of capital  drilling and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals 
to the extent these factors lead to reductions in our drilling plans and associated capital budgets in future periods  our financial position  cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted 
at december   our estimated total proved oil  natural gas reserves and natural gas liquids  as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm  cawley  gillespie associates  inc  were approximately  thousand barrels of oil equivalent mboe  consisting of  thousand barrels bbls of oil  and  million cubic feet mmcf of natural gas and  thousand barrels bbls natural gas liquids 
approximately of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed 

table of contents critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
oil and natural gas activities accounting for oil and natural gas activities is subject to unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and natural gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of unsuccessful exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred upon a determination that the well is uneconomical while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and natural gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using period end prices and costs and a discount rate 
we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
proved oil and natural gas reserves estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and sec guidelines 
our engineering estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization and impairment expense 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of i the quality and quantity of available data  ii the interpretation of that data  iii the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and iv the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a is primarily dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves  which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced  the rate at which we record dd a expense would increase  reducing net income 
such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves 
impairment we review our property and equipment in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires us to evaluate property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  then we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value 
further  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining depreciation periods 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities associated with our oil and gas wells and to restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are most often associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations we have will be take effect in the future 
additionally  these operations are subject to private contracts and government regulations that often have vague descriptions of what is required 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the present value calculations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate removal cost amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of obligations and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities we utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next months 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts  which would potentially allow us to not record the change in fair value of our derivative contracts in the statement of operations 
we carry our derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets  with the changes in the fair value included in our statements of operations in the period in which the change occurs 
our results of operations would potentially have been significantly different had we elected and qualified for hedge accounting on our derivative contracts 

table of contents income taxes the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the liability method based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided  if necessary  to reserve the amount of net operating loss and net deferred tax assets which the company may not be able to use because of the expiration of maximum carryover periods allowed under applicable tax codes 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash during were cash flows from operating activities  availability under our senior credit agreement  and loans from related parties 
the capital markets  as they relate to us  have been adversely impacted by the current financial crisis  concerns about overall deflation and its effect on commodity prices  the possibility of a deepening world recession that may extend for a long period into the future  a lack of liquidity in the banking system and the unavailability and cost of credit 
continued volatility in the capital markets could adversely impact our ability to replace our reserves  and eventually  our production levels 
our future capital resources and liquidity may depend  in part  on our success in developing the leasehold interests that we acquired 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves  which is typical in the capital intensive oil and gas industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding and acquiring additional reserves 
we expect to fund our future capital requirements through internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our senior credit agreements 
long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices  our commodity price hedging activities as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas industry 
oil and natural gas prices have continued to fall after december  if these prices hold for a prolonged period of time or continue to fall  our ability to fund capital expenditures  reduce debt  meet financial obligations and become profitable may be materially impacted 
debt as of december  in thousands except percentage revolving credit facility long term debt related party short term debt related party current maturities of long term debt  short term debt and bank overdraft total debt stockholders equity debt to capital ratio at year end  our total debt was  thousand compared to total debt of  thousand at year end and  thousand at year end as of december   current debt included  thousand as current maturities of the revolving credit facility 
however  the company is not obligated to repay this facility prior to the due date  except for such payments as may be required under the credit agreement in the event of a redetermination and reduction of the borrowing base 
as of december    thousand of the  thousand was due to the decision of management to continue reducing the debt below the borrowing base 
as of december   current debt included  thousand as current maturities  which again was due to management s decision to continue payments to reduce debt below the borrowing base 
cash flow our primary sources of cash in  and were from operating and financing activities 
proceeds from loans obtained from related parties  proceeds from senior credit agreement and cash received from operations were offset by repayments of our senior credit agreement  repayments of loans from related parties and cash used in investing activities to fund acquisition activities 
operating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
working capital was substantially influenced by these variables 
fluctuation in commodity prices and our overall cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our future capital expenditures or influence our ability to reduce our long term loans 
prices for oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout recent years 
see results of continuing operations below for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales

our dd a rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations 
there are several factors that can impact our composite dd a rate and expense  including but not limited to field production profiles  drilling or acquisition of new wells  disposition of existing wells  and reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance and commodity prices  and impairments 
changes to these factors may cause our composite dd a rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year 
dd a increased by  or  thousand  in when compared to primarily due to approximately  thousand dd a which was related to the oil and gas properties acquired in gfb acquisition 
the remaining increase is attributed to lower commodity prices at year end that impacted the estimated total reserves  which are the basis for the depletion calculation 
impairments of oil and gas assets of  thousand in were primarily a result of lower commodity prices in general and low volume of oil and gas produced in few of our north texas fields and in the wells in which the company participated in the barnett shale formation in parker county  texas  in particular 
the impairments of  thousand in were primarily the result of the low volume of gas produced in the wells that the company participated on the barnett shale formation in parker county 
impairment of other properties in of thousand was attributed to undeveloped real estate located in israel

as a result of this transaction  the company recorded a one time non recurring net gain of  thousand 
net loss gain on derivative contracts 
we enter into derivative commodity instruments to economically hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on our anticipated oil and natural gas production 
consistent with the prior year  we have elected not to designate any positions as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  we recorded the net change in the mark to market value of these derivative contracts in the consolidated statement of operations 
at december   we had a million derivative asset  of which million was classified as current 
we recorded a net derivative gain of million million unrealized gain partially offset by a million loss from net cash payments on settled contracts for the year ended december  compared to a net derivative loss of million million unrealized loss and a million net gain for cash received on settled contracts for the year ended december  this increase in our net derivative gain is primarily attributable to the recent decrease in the forward strip pricing used to value our derivatives and additional swap contracts we entered in at december   we had a million derivative liability  of which million was classified as current 
we recorded a net derivative loss of million million unrealized loss and a million net gain for cash received on settled contracts for the year ended december  compared to a derivative gain of for the year ended december  this decrease is due to the increase in commodity prices and additional swap contracts we entered in 
table of contents income tax the company s tax expense changed from a benefit of  thousand in to an expense of thousand in the overall increase is the result of increased profitability from continuing operations due to the company s acquisition of oil and gas properties in and the variance in the tax rate from the statutory  used in the us  is due mainly to the refund of taxes paid by the us branch in israel  deferred state tax items net of federal benefit and other return to accrual items on the us consolidated income tax return
