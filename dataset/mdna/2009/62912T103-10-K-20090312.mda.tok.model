item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an independent exploration and production company focused on generating and developing natural gas prospects in appalachia and other unconventional plays with similar geologic characteristics 
we also control the midstream and field wide gas gathering facilities for our core appalachian properties  providing deliverability directly from the wellhead to interstate pipelines serving major east coast natural gas markets  and we operate natural gas distribution facilities for two communities in kentucky 
historically  we developed most of our prospects through sponsored drilling partnerships with outside investors  maintaining combined interests as both general partner and an investor ranging from to  along with additional reversionary interests after specified distribution thresholds are reached 
we account for those interests using the proportionate consolidation method  with all material inter company accounts and transactions eliminated on consolidation 
beginning in the second half of  we changed our business model to accelerate organic growth by retaining all of our available working interest in new wells drilled on operated properties  with a view toward limiting our use of drilling partnerships to participation in non operated projects 
while we are committed to continue expanding our reserves and production through the drillbit  we are addressing current conditions in the financial and energy markets with a planned reduction in capital spending to approximately million for and a resumption of drilling partnership participation in our operated initiatives until market conditions improve 
this should enable us to continue meeting our drilling commitments and objectives for core properties without access to the capital markets and with limited reliance on additional draws under our credit facility 
results of operations and revenues 
the following table shows the components of our revenues for and  together with their percentages of total revenue in and percentage change on a year over year basis 
year ended december  of revenue revenue change contract drilling oil and gas production gas transmission  compression and processing total our revenue mix for reflects our ongoing strategy for transitioning to a more production based business  with oil and gas sales accounting for of total revenues  compared to of total revenues in despite our planned reduction in capital expenditures for  we expect this trend to continue on a long term basis as we expand our horizontal drilling initiatives and our infrastructure and acreage position in our core operating areas 
contract drilling revenues reflect the size and timing of our drilling program initiatives  as well our ownership interest in sponsored programs 
although we receive the proceeds from private placements in sponsored programs as customers drilling deposits under our program drilling contracts  we recognize revenues from the interests of outside investors in these programs on the completed contract method as the wells are drilled  rather than when funds are received 
during  we sponsored a program for participation in wells on non operated properties known as the hre fields  spanning six counties in west virginia and virginia 
our contract drilling revenues in reflect ongoing operations for that program and the completion of our hre program 
outside investors have interests of before payout and after payout in both of those programs 
the growth in our production revenues for reflects a increase in production output to  mmcfe  compared to  mmcfe in our volumetric growth was driven by added production from wells brought on line during we anticipate ongoing production gains as we continue to bring completed wells on line  including substantial contributions from our horizontal drilling initiatives 
our natural gas production is sold primarily through gas marketing intermediaries 
approximately of our natural gas production in was sold under fixed price contracts  and the balance primarily at prices determined monthly under formulas based on prevailing market indices 
realized natural gas prices in averaged per mcf for our appalachian production and per mcf overall  compared to an average overall realization of per mcf in gas transmission  compression and processing revenues for were driven by fees totaling  for moving third party gas through our ngas gathering system and  in related processing fees for liquids extraction through our rogersville plant 
this component of revenues also includes gathering and compression fees of  for moving our drilling program investors share of gas through our field wide facilities  together with contributions of  from gas utility sales and  from our interest in the gathering system that services a non operated coalbed methane project in the arkoma basin 
expenses 
the following table shows the components of our direct and other expenses for and percentages listed in the table reflect margins for each component of direct expenses and percentages of total revenue for each component of other expenses

these expenses increased by on a year over year basis and represented of contract drilling revenues in  compared to in the prior year 
all of our contract drilling activities in were conducted on non operated hre properties in west virginia and virginia 
margins for contract drilling operations reflect our cost plus pricing model  which we adopted in to address price volatility for drilling services  equipment and steel casing requirements 
production expenses represent lifting costs  field operating and maintenance expenses  related overhead  severance and other production taxes  third party transportation fees and processing costs 
the increase in production expenses on a year over year basis primarily reflects our volumetric growth and higher severance and production taxes  as well as  in hauling costs for natural gas liquids  which we began stripping from our appalachian production through our rogersville plant during the first quarter of our margins in both reported periods reflect cost savings realized from ownership of the ngas gathering system acquired in march  eliminating transportation fees for our dedicated appalachian production  of which approximately is now delivered through the system 
as a percentage of oil and gas production revenues  our production expenses were in  compared to in the prior year  primarily reflecting start up costs for bringing our rogersville processing plant and our fonde and haley s mill gathering systems on line  as well as added transportation fees for extracted natural gas liquids 
gas transmission  compression and processing expenses in were of associated revenues  compared to in the prior year 
the margins for this part of our business have benefited from third party fees generated by the ngas gathering system 
our gas transmission  compression and processing expenses do not include capitalized costs of approximately million during for extensions of our field wide gas gathering systems and additions to dehydration and compression capacity required to bring new wells on line 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised primarily of selling and promotional costs for our sponsored drilling partnerships and general overhead costs 
our sg a expenses in increased by from the prior year  primarily reflecting sales costs for a drilling partnership launched in april for participation in our non operated initiatives in west virginia and virginia  along with overhead costs for supporting our expanded operations as a whole 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses decreased from in to in non cash charges for options  warrants and deferred compensation reflect the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options 
under this method  employee stock options are valued at the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  and the compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period 
we also recognized an accrual of  in for deferred compensation costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a is recognized under the units of production method  based on the estimated proved developed reserves of the underlying oil and gas properties  and on a straight line basis over the useful life of other property and equipment 
the increase in dd a charges reflects substantial additions to our oil and gas properties  gas gathering systems and related equipment 
we recognized bad debt expenses aggregating  in a first quarter charge of  coupled with a prior period reserve  represents the entire amount due for oil sales to a regional refinery prior to its filing for reorganization under the bankruptcy laws last year 
a second quarter charge of  reflects a writeoff of a non performing loan to a regional operator on a three well project in texas 
in the third quarter of  we recognized a bad debt expense of  for unreimbursed trade debt we paid on behalf of a virginia steam company in which we previously held a interest

interest expense for decreased from lower variable rates under our revolving credit facility 
draws under the credit facility were used primarily to support our ongoing drilling initiatives and enhancements of our field wide gas gathering systems 
deferred income tax expense recognized in both reported periods represents future tax liability at the operating company level 
although we have no current tax liability due to the utilization of intangible drilling costs  our consolidated income tax expense is negatively impacted by the non recognition of tax benefits at the parent company level

production expenses in were consistent with our volumetric growth 
our margins in both periods reflect cost savings realized from ownership of the ngas gathering system acquired in march  eliminating transportation fees for our share of leatherwood  straight creek and sme production delivered through the system 
gas transmission  compression and processing expenses in were of associated revenues  compared to in the margins for this part of our business have benefited from third party fees generated by the ngas gathering system

our gas transmission  compression and processing expenses do not reflect those acquisition costs or capitalized costs of approximately million in for extensions of our field wide gas gathering systems  additions to dehydration and compression capacity or build outs of gas processing and treatment facilities 
we expensed the suspended exploratory well costs during for wells in a well program we began late in to test the shallow new albany shale formation on the eastern rim of the illinois basin in western kentucky 
this resulted in an impairment charge of  in the carrying value of our oil and gas assets during  in addition to a charge of  recognized for the first three wells in that program during sg a expenses are comprised primarily of selling and promotional costs for our sponsored drilling programs and overhead costs for supporting our expanded operations as a whole  including additions to our staff and technology infrastructure as well as increased salary and other employee related expenses over the last several years 
non cash charges for options  warrants and deferred compensation reflect the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options

we recognized a bad debt expense of  in the third quarter of to reflect a reserve against past due accounts receivable from oil sales to a regional refinery 
see critical accounting policies and estimates allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also recognized a loss of  from the sale of fixed assets in  compared to gains aggregating  from asset sales in interest expense for increased from higher overall bank borrowings 
draws under our credit facility during were used primarily to support our ongoing drilling initiatives and enhancements of our field wide gas gathering systems 
deferred income tax expense represents future tax liability at the operating company level 
although we have no current tax liability due to the utilization of intangible drilling costs  our consolidated income tax expense is negatively impacted by the non recognition of tax benefits at the parent company level 
net income and eps 
we recognized a net loss of  in  compared to net income of  in  reflecting the foregoing factors 
basic eps was based on  weighted average common shares outstanding in  compared to eps of based on  weighted average common shares outstanding in liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
net cash of  was provided by operating activities in during the year  we used  in investing activities  most of which reflects net additions to our oil and gas properties and gathering systems 
these investments were funded in part with net cash of  from financing activities  primarily consisting of advances under our revolving credit facility 
as a result of these activities  net cash decreased from  at the end of to  at december  net cash of  was provided by operating activities in during the year  we used  in investing activities  most of which reflects net additions to our oil and gas properties and gathering systems 
these investments were funded in part with net cash of  from financing activities 
as a result of these activities  net cash decreased from  at december  to  at the end of as of december   we had a working capital deficit of  this reflects wide fluctuations in our current assets and liabilities from the timing of customer deposits and expenditures under drilling contracts with our sponsored programs 
since these fluctuations are normalized over relatively short time periods  we do not consider working capital to be a reliable measure of liquidity 
the working capital deficit at the end of is not expected to have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods 
capital resources 
our business involves significant capital requirements 
the rate of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
without successful development activities  our proved reserves would decline as oil and gas is produced from our proved developed reserves 
we also have substantial annual drilling commitments under various leases and farmouts for our appalachian properties  including an annual well commitment for our leatherwood field 
our long term performance and profitability is dependent not only on meeting these commitments and recovering existing oil and gas reserves  but also on our ability to find or acquire additional reserves and fund related infrastructure build outs on terms that are economically and operationally advantageous 
we have relied on a combination of cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and private placements of our convertible notes and equity securities to fund our reserve and infrastructure development and acquisition activities 
historically  we also relied on participation in our operated drilling initiatives by outside investors in our sponsored partnerships 
for  we changed our business model to accelerate organic growth by retaining all of our available working interest in wells drilled on operated properties  with a view to limiting our use of drilling partnerships to non operated initiatives 
while we are committed to continue expanding our reserves and production through the drillbit  we have addressed the challenging conditions in our industry by reducing our capital spending budget to million  allocated to drilling and the balance to infrastructure and lease acquisition projects 
this is in line with our anticipated cash flow from operations and may be adjusted during the year in response to market developments 
to meet our drilling commitments and objectives with limited reliance on additional draws under our credit facility  we are returning to our established partnership structure and sales network  which raised over million for a non operated program last year 
we expect to maintain a interest in this year s program  which will increase to after program payout 
with our critical infrastructure in place to provide deliverability for our production at a low cash cost  this will allow us to continue delivering organic growth  although at lower rates than we could achieve with access to the capital markets 
if market conditions improve  we would expect to raise additional capital to accelerate drilling and meet our long term resource development objectives 
we have a senior secured revolving credit facility maintained by our us operating subsidiary  daugherty petroleum  inc dpi  with keybank national association  as agent and primary lender 
the facility provides for revolving term loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to million  with a scheduled maturity in september we amended the facility in may to add to the collateral package and in august to increase the borrowing base from million to million 
the borrowing base was lowered to million at year end to reflect the downturn in the energy and credit markets 
outstanding borrowings under the facility bear interest at fluctuating rates ranging from the agent s prime rate to above that rate  depending on the amount of borrowing base utilization 
we are also responsible for commitment fees at rates ranging from to of the unused borrowing base 
the facility is guaranteed by ngas and is secured by liens on dpi s oil and gas properties and gathering facilities 
as of december   outstanding borrowings under the facility aggregated million  with million in letters of credit  and the interest rate amounted to 
we are in compliance with our financial and other covenants under the credit facility at december  we have an outstanding series of convertible notes due december  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes are convertible into our common shares at a conversion price of  reflecting an antidilution adjustment based on the pricing of a registered direct equity placement of our common stock at per share in november we will be entitled to redeem the notes at their face amount plus accrued interest if the prevailing market price of our common stock exceeds of the note conversion price for specified periods 
in the event of a default under the notes or any change of control  the holders may require us to redeem the notes at a default rate equal to of their principal amount or a change of control rate equal to the greater of of their principal amount or the consideration that would be received by the holders for the underlying shares in the change of control transaction 
any notes that are neither redeemed nor converted prior to maturity will be repayable in cash or in common shares  valued for that purpose at of their prevailing market price 
our ability to repay our revolving credit and convertible debt will be subject to our future performance and prospects as well as market and general economic conditions 
our future revenues  profitability and rate of growth will continue to be substantially dependent on the demand and market price for natural gas 
future market prices for natural gas will also have a significant impact on our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity  to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms and to attract drilling partnership capital 
while we have been able to mitigate some of the steep decline in natural gas prices with fixed price  fixed volume physical delivery contracts that cover portions of our natural gas production  we are exposed to price volatility for future production not covered by these arrangements 
see risk factors and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we have addressed the general economic downturn and current unsettled conditions in natural gas markets by reducing our capital expenditure budget and returning to our established drilling partnership structure for participation in our development initiatives 
to realize our long term goals for growth in revenues and reserves  however  we will continue to dependent on the credit and capital markets or other financing alternatives 
any prolonged constriction in the capital markets could require us to sell assets or pursue other financing or strategic arrangements to meet those objectives and to repay or refinance our long term debt at maturity 
forward looking statements some statements made by us in this report are prospective and constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act and section a of the securities act of other than statements of historical fact  all statements that address future activities  outcomes and other matters we plan  expect  budget  intend or estimate  and other similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
among other things  these include uncertainty about estimates of future natural gas production and required capital expenditures  commodity price volatility  increases in the cost of drilling  completion  gas gathering and processing or other costs of developing and producing our reserves  unavailability of drilling rigs and services  drilling  operational and environmental risks  regulatory changes and litigation risks  and uncertainties in estimating proved oil and gas reserves  projecting future rates of production and timing of development and remedial expenditures 
if the assumptions we use in making forward looking statements prove incorrect or the risks described in this report occur  our actual results could differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
see risk factors 
financial market risk interest rate risk 
borrowings under our secured credit facility bear interest at fluctuating market based rates 
accordingly  our interest expenses are sensitive to market changes  which exposes us to interest rate risk on current and future indebtedness under the facility 
foreign market risk 
we sell our products and services exclusively in the united states and receive payment solely in united states dollars 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets  except to the extent that global demand may affect domestic energy markets 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are parties to leases for office facilities and various types of equipment 
we are also obligated to make payments at specified times and amounts under instruments governing our long term debt and other commercial commitments 
the following table lists our minimum annual commitments as of december  under these instruments

excludes an allocation of  from our convertible notes in the principal amount of  based on equity components of their conversion features 
related party transactions because we operate through subsidiaries and affiliated drilling partnerships  our corporate structure causes various agreements and transactions in the normal course of business to be treated as related party transactions 
our policy to structure any transactions with related parties only on terms that are no less favorable to the company than could be obtained on an arm s length basis from unrelated parties 
significant related party transactions are summarized in notes and to the consolidated financial statements and related disclosure included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to utilize estimates and make judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis  and the results of these evaluations form a basis for making decisions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable 
the critical accounting policies affecting these aspects of our financial reporting are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
policies involving the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are summarized below 
estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows 
estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows are used in impairment tests of goodwill and other long lived assets 
these estimates are prepared as of year end by our independent petroleum engineers and are updated internally at mid year 
there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is dependent on the quality of available data and is subject to engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of our drilling  testing and production after the date of these estimates may require future revisions  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include property  equipment and goodwill 
long lived assets with an indefinite life are reviewed at least annually for impairment  while other long lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values of these assets are not recoverable 
during  we recognized an impartment charge of  for exploratory well costs that had been capitalized for less than one year pending our assessment of reserves for the project 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts when deemed appropriate to reflect losses that could result from failures by customers or other parties to make payments on our trade receivables 
the estimates of this allowance  when maintained  are based on a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the trade accounts receivable  specific information obtained on the financial condition of customers and specific agreements or negotiated settlements with customers 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is the pricing of natural gas production  which has been highly volatile and unpredictable during the last several years 
while we do not use financial hedging instruments to manage our exposure to these fluctuations or for speculative trading purposes  we do use fixed price  fixed volume physical delivery contracts that cover portions of our natural gas production at specified prices during varying periods of time up to two years from the contract date 
because these physical delivery contracts qualify for the normal purchase and sale exception under sfas no 
 they are not treated as financial hedging activities and are not subject to mark to market accounting 
the financial impact of physical delivery contracts is included in our oil and gas revenues at the time of settlement  which in turn affects our average realized natural gas prices 
during  approximately of our natural gas production was sold under fixed price contracts at rates ranging from to per dth 
the balance of our natural gas production for the year was sold primarily at prices determined monthly under formulas based on prevailing market indices 
as of december   we had contracts in place for portions of our anticipated gas production from operated appalachian properties at sales prices ranging from per mcf to per mcf
