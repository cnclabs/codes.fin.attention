overview we are a development stage company formed to commercialize flexible pv modules using proprietary technology 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately million in revenues  none of which resulted from our planned principal operations to commercialize flexible pv modules 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
under our current business plan  we expect losses to continue through at which point we plan to commence production on our initial mw manufacturing line that is currently in development 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private equity financings including our recent secondary public offering of  shares of common stock with net proceeds of approximately million completed in may  and an additional investment of approximately million by our largest shareholder norsk hydro in october the proceeds from these stock sales are primarily being utilized to fund the equipment purchases for our mw production facility in thornton  colorado 
while focused on speed to market  we believe that quality and consistency of product will be paramount to our success in the marketplace 
consequently  our path to commercialization is defined by a highly disciplined  staged progression based upon the achievement of key milestones and supported by over fourteen years of concerted research and development activity by our scientists 
our progression also takes into account market conditions  as well as financing options 
in keeping with our philosophy  we completed construction of a mw production line in december in march  we demonstrated initial operating capability ioc of our mw production line by initiating production trials as an end to end integrated process 
early ioc production trials resulted in average thin film device efficiencies of and small area monolithically integrated module efficiencies of over 
recent and ongoing production optimization trials have resulted in thin film device efficiencies in the to range and corresponding module efficiencies in the to range 
in the fourth quarter the us department of energy s national renewable energy laboratory nrel independently verified that the modules produced on our mw line measured as high as in conversion efficiency 
the test modules measured six inches wide by one foot long and serve as our building block for both bipv and portable power products 
during we focused on testing and qualifying our mw production line in anticipation of commencing limited regular production 
during the first quarter of  we began regular production of monolithically integrated flexible cigs modules from our mw production line 
we expect that process optimization will be an ongoing effort as we continuously strive for improvements in production yield  production throughput  and product efficiency that have a direct bearing on our cost competitiveness in the marketplace 
during  we initiated the critical tasks of internal product testing and product development with customers 
in  we continued those tasks further and have commenced prototype development with our bipv  eipv and military customers by providing them test samples from our mw production line 
at the same time we expect to complete the internal testing and product certification in the second half of 
table of contents the company s new manufacturing facility in thornton  colorado is in the final stages of completion and will be ready to accommodate installation of the equipment in second quarter of production tooling and equipment for the mw plant began arriving in the first quarter of and installation is scheduled to be completed in the first half of we expect to begin production with an annual rated capacity of mw by the middle of  and mw of annual capacity by the end of we intend to incrementally expand our production capacity to mw or greater by adding more capacity based on manufacturing developments  market conditions and availability of financing 
commercialization and manufacturing expansion plan we intend to be the first company to manufacture large  roll format  pv modules in commercial quantities that use cigs on a flexible  plastic substrate 
our manufacturing expansion plan entails the design  installation  qualification  testing and operation of additional production tools to increase our rated production capacity 
we intend to incrementally expand our aggregate production capacity to mw by attaining the following milestones within the time frames indicated second half of complete product certification with underwriters laboratory ul in the us and technischer berwachungs verein t v in europe from mw production line 
fourth quarter of begin qualification of production tools for the first mw 
first half of begin production and ramp up of the first half of initial mw capacity 
second half of commence ramp up to full mw of rated capacity 
although we currently plan to expand our production capacity to mw or more by adding more capacity  the actual timing and amount of production capacity for the initial mw and follow on capacity that we install may significantly deviate due to market conditions  availability of financing  timeliness of delivery of production tools  product performance and other factors described in this annual report 
we therefore expect to have approximately mw of rated production capacity in place by the end of rated production capacity refers to our expected level of annual production upon optimization of our production process and is based on assumed production yields and module efficiencies 
the actual production levels that we are able to realize at any point during our planned expansion will depend on a variety of factors  including our ability to optimize our production process to achieve targeted production yields and module efficiencies 
although we currently plan to expand our production capacity in accordance with the timeline above  the actual timing and amount of production capacity that we install may significantly deviate from the above plan due to market conditions  availability of financing  timeliness of delivery of production tools  product performance and other factors described in this annual report 
see significant trends  uncertainties and challenges below 
we also recognize the importance of developing strategies and plans that may allow for the timely acceleration of our production beyond the current plan in order to meet market demand and the challenges from competitors who are presently expanding their operations 
although we do not expect that minor delays in product certifications would significantly affect our ability to continue developing product applications with our customers  delays that extend significantly beyond mid likely would impact our ability to develop demand for our pv modules  and would affect our planned sales and results of operations in  when we expect to have commenced production using our planned production tools for approximately mw of rated capacity 
using our mw production line as a model  we have consummated the fixed price delivery contracts for the majority of the production tools for the mw line 
the equipment supplier schedules in the supply agreements provide for the installation of the majority of the production tools 
table of contents by the end of the third quarter of we plan to commence production ramp up to mw of rated capacity by the end of the first quarter in order to qualify approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of  we intend to purchase and install production tools that will process one third meter wide plastic rolls similar to those used in our existing mw production line 
significant delays in achieving desired production yields  module efficiencies or other performance metrics on the mw production line and or delays in the delivery  installation and qualification of the mw production tools may impact our real and projected product sales in we have initiated engineering and development of the one meter wide production tools to support future expansion of rated capacity 
successfully transitioning to one meter wide rolls should significantly increase our throughput  thereby reducing the number of manufacturing tools and  hence  the amount of capital expenditures required for equipment and facilities 
generally speaking  we believe that all other process variables  such as speed  thickness and composition  should remain unchanged 
based upon discussions with our equipment suppliers  we have identified deposition of the cigs layer in the one meter wide format as the most challenging aspect of transitioning to one meter wide rolls  consequently  we have initiated the development of one meter wide prototype cigs and molybdenum production tools to enable us to begin evaluating and testing one meter wide area deposition sources and process control systems 
the one meter cigs prototype production tool is scheduled for installation in and the one meter molybdenum production tool is scheduled for delivery in we plan to conduct six to nine months of testing and evaluation prior to committing the capital in to procure the one meter format production tools to support further expansion of rated capacity 
our planned expansion to approximately mw of rated capacity will require additional capital  which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms  if at all or without dilution to our stockholders 
capital equipment expenditures and manufacturing costs since our formation in october  most of our cash outlays have gone toward the investment in capital equipment necessary to develop our manufacturing capabilities for producing the commercial products we envision 
we expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future as we expand to approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of we will require additional capital and additional facilities to achieve our manufacturing expansion plans 
if we are unable to secure the necessary capital or to manage the disbursement of capital taking into consideration any unforeseen factors  such as cost increases from our equipment suppliers and the potential negative changes in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  our ability to expand our manufacturing capacity as planned  as well as our financial performance and results of operations  may be adversely affected 
we currently expect the capital expenditures to support the first mw of rated capacity to total approximately million to million for manufacturing equipment and approximately million for the acquisition and renovations of our new manufacturing facility in thornton  colorado 
we also expect capital expenditures of approximately million for installation  qualification and other associated pre operating expenses related to the first mw expansion 
in addition  we have budgeted approximately million in and for the procurement and installation of the one meter wide manufacturing development tools  sources  and sensor control systems 
in order to install the next mw and then additional mw of rated capacity  we expect that we will require another approximately million to million for property  plant and equipment and approximately million for installation  qualification and other associated pre operating expenses 
capital expenditure estimates for our expansion reflect an increase from our previous estimates primarily due to higher costs for equipment infrastructure  as well as higher estimated costs for certain equipment 
our major equipment suppliers are located in japan  the united kingdom and germany 
to manage the uncertainties related to the procurement of capital equipment  we have continued to work closely with our equipment suppliers to complete the engineering of our new tools and refine the estimates of our planned capital outlays 
the production tool costs are subject to change until we place 
table of contents firm procurement orders with our suppliers 
to manage the fluctuations of foreign exchange rates  we have implemented forward pricing contracts for certain agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
significant trends  uncertainties and challenges we believe that the significant trends  uncertainties and challenges that directly or indirectly affect our financial performance and results of operations are our ability to achieve desired production yields  module efficiencies and other performance targets  and to obtain necessary or desired certifications for our pv modules  our ability to expand production in accordance with our plans set forth above under commercialization and manufacturing expansion plan to add approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of  another approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of and another approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of  and to achieve certifications of our planned pv modules  our ability to achieve projected operational performance and cost metrics  our ability to consummate strategic relationships with key partners  including original equipment manufacturer oem customers  system integrators  and distributors who deal directly with end users in the bipv  eipv  portable power  and commodity solar panel markets  the effect that currency fluctuations may have on our capital equipment purchases  manufacturing costs and the price of our planned pv modules  our ability to manage the planned expansion of our manufacturing facilities  operations and personnel  and our ability and the ability of our distributors  suppliers and customers to manage operations and orders during the global financial crisis  and our ability to identify and retain a qualified permanent president and chief executive officer 
basis of presentation the company s activities to date have substantially consisted of raising capital  research and development  and the development of a mw production plant and additional mw expansion plant 
revenues to date have been generated from the company s governmental research and development r d contracts and have not been significant 
the company s planned principal operations to commercialize flexible pv modules have not yet commenced 
accordingly  the company is considered to be in the development stage  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises 
cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid debt securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
the company maintains cash balances which may exceed federally insured limits 
the company does not believe that this results in significant credit risk 
investments the company accounts for investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company has classified its investments as available for sale 
such investments are carried at fair value  based on quoted market prices with the unrealized holding gains and losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed using the specific identification method 
the company evaluates declines in market value for potential impairment 
if the decline results in a value below cost and is 
table of contents determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is established 
fair value estimates the fair value of an asset or liability is the amount at which it could be exchanged or settled in a current transaction between willing parties 
the carrying value for cash and cash equivalents  investments  restricted cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued property and equipment  accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  the company has adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
foreign currency translation bank account balances related to our forward contracts are translated to us dollars utilizing the period end exchange rate 
gains or losses on foreign currency translations are recorded in other income loss in the statement of operations 
revenue recognition revenue to date is from governmental research and development contracts under terms that are cost plus fee or firm fixed price 
revenue from cost plus fee contracts is recognized as costs are incurred on the basis of direct costs plus allowable indirect costs and an allocable portion of the firm fixed fee 
revenue from firm fixed price contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  with costs and estimated profits included in contract revenue as work is performed 
if actual and estimated costs to complete a contract indicate a loss  provision is made currently for the loss anticipated on the contract 
patents at such time as the company is awarded patents  patent costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the legal life  or over their estimated useful lives  whichever is shorter 
as of december   the company had  of net patent costs of which  represent costs net of amortization incurred for an awarded patent  and the remaining  represents costs incurred for patent applications filed 
amortization expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at the original cost to the company 
assets are being depreciated over estimated useful lives of one to ten years using the straight line method  commencing when the asset is placed in service 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remainder of the lease term or the life of the improvements 
upon retirement or disposal  the cost of the asset disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 

table of contents the company computes depreciation expense using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as presented in the table below 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the lease 
useful lives in years buildings manufacturing machinery and equipment furniture  fixtures  computer hardware software leasehold improvements life of lease long lived assets we account for our long lived  tangible assets and definitive lived intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas   accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  we assess long lived assets classified as held and used  including our property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever long lived asset may not be recoverable 
these events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or group of assets combined with a history of such losses  significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we evaluated our long lived assets for impairment for the period ending december  and concluded that no valuation allowances were required 
risks and uncertainties the company s operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those associated with the ability to meet obligations  continuing losses  fluctuation in operating results  funding expansions  strategic alliances  financing arrangement terms that may restrict operations  regulatory issues  and competition 
additionally  us government contracts may be terminated prior to completion of full funding by the us government 
net loss per common share statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share  provides for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share 
basic earnings per share include no dilution and are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share reflect the potential of securities that could share in the earnings of the company  similar to fully diluted earnings per share 
common stock equivalents consisting of class b warrants  ipo warrants representative warrants  and stock options outstanding as of december  of approximately million shares  have been omitted from loss per share because they are anti dilutive 
basic and diluted loss per share was the same in each of the periods ended december  and research and development costs research and development costs are incurred during the process of researching and developing new products and enhancing our manufacturing processes and consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel  materials  supplies and equipment depreciation 
we expense these costs as incurred until the resulting product has been completed and tested and is ready for commercial manufacturing 
we also incur research and development expenses on our us federal government research and development contracts and expense as incurred 
incomes taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates as of the date of enactment 
interest and penalties  if applicable would be recorded in operations 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the company adopted the provisions of fin on january  as defined  fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
the company became subject to the provisions of fin as of january   and has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
the company has identified its federal tax return and its colorado tax return as major tax jurisdictions  as defined 
the periods subject to examination for the company s federal and state tax returns are tax years through the company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to fin in addition  the company did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of fin stock based compensation the company accounts for share based payments under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  officers  directors  and consultants  including employee stock options based on estimated fair values 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in the company s statements of operations 
stock based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  as necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for purposes of determining estimated fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant under sfas r  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
because the company s employee stock options may have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the company s employee stock options 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies  which could materially impact the company s fair value determination 
the application of the sfas r accounting principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  or if the company decides to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that the company records in the future under sfas r may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period and could materially affect its loss from operations  net loss and net loss per share 
comprehensive income loss our comprehensive income loss consists of our net income loss  and changes in unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investments  the impact of which has been excluded from net loss 
we present our comprehensive income loss in the statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income and loss 
our accumulated other comprehensive income loss is presented as a component of equity in our balance sheets and consists of the 
table of contents cumulative amount of unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investments that we have incurred since the inception of our business 
reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made to the and financial information to conform to the presentation 
such reclassifications had no effect on net loss and are primarily related to reclassifying costs between research and development costs and general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for specified financial assets and liabilities on a contract by contract basis

research and development revenues 
our r d revenues were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  an increase of  the majority of our r d revenues during the year ended december  and were revenues earned on our government r d contracts 
the increase in primarily relates to two government contracts awarded in june research and development 
r d costs include the costs incurred for pre production activities on our mw line and our planned mw line and costs related to our governmental contracts 
r d costs were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  costs related to pre production activities increased  the pre production cost increases were comprised of materials and equipment related costs of approximately  depreciation and amortization of approximately  personnel related costs of approximately  facility related costs of approximately  and stock compensation expense of approximately  governmental r d expenditures increased by  related to the contracts awarded june general and administrative 
g a expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  this increase is comprised of costs associated with increased headcount of approximately  approximately  for severance related costs  increases in supplies and mailing  trade show  and facilities costs of approximately  and an increase in stock compensation expense of approximately  interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase in interest expense relates to the amortization of the commitment fee related to our chfa loan 
during   of interest incurred on the chfa loan was capitalized 
no interest was capitalized in interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  interest income represents interest on cash and short term investments 
the increase in interest income is due to higher balances of cash and short term investments during as compared to realized loss on investments 
realized losses on investments were  for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   an increase of  losses on our investments  primarily corporate securities  comprised the net loss during realized loss on forward contracts and unrealized losses on forward contracts 
for the year ended december   the unrealized loss on forward contracts was  and the realized loss was  although the hedging activity is designed to fix the dollar amount to be expended  the asset purchased is recorded at the spot rate in effect as of the date of the payment to the supplier 
the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate has been reported as a loss on forward contract 

table of contents the forward contract was effective in fixing the amount to be paid to the supplier in dollar terms as of the date the forward contract was entered into 
net loss 
our net loss was  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december   an increase in net loss of  the increase in net loss can be summarized in variances in significant account activity as follows increase decrease to net loss for the year ended december  contract revenues research and development costs manufacturing r d government r d non cash stock based compensation general and administrative expenses corporate g a non cash stock based compensation interest expense interest income realized loss on investments realized loss on forward contract unrealized loss on forward contracts increase to net loss comparison of the years ended december  and certain reclassifications have been made to the and financial information to conform to the presentation

our r d revenues were  for the year ended december  there were no r d contract revenues for the year ended december  our revenues during the year ended december  were earned on our government r d contracts novated january  from itn and new government r d contracts awarded to us in research and development expenses 
r d expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase is comprised of  related to personnel  materials and facilities required to optimize our manufacturing processes in advance of commencing full scale production on our mw production line   of direct costs and related overhead on our government r d contracts that began on january   and an increase in stock compensation expense of approximately  for our manufacturing and r d personnel 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses g a were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase is comprised of two components  an increase in corporate g a expenses of  and an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense of  the increase in corporate g a expenses corresponds with our increase in headcount and increases in corporate activity such as legal fees  sec reporting costs  stock and corporate registration fees  and travel and insurance costs 
the significant increase in stock 
table of contents compensation expense for the year ended december  is primarily due to the requirements of sfas r and eitf for measurement of stock based compensation to non employees as vesting occurs and for unvested shares as of the balance sheet date 
since our stock price as of december  was significantly higher than as of december   this requirement resulted in an increased fair value calculation related to stock based payments to non employees 
additional grants of our stock options during also contributed to the increase 
interest expense 
interest expense was for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  interest expense in resulted from interest on the bridge loan notes and related bridge rights and financing transactions of which  was non cash related to the valuation and subsequent amortization of the bridge loan rights

the offering price of per share resulted in gross proceeds of  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately  net proceeds to the company were approximately  jp morgan was the managing underwriter of our secondary public offering 
for the year ended december   our cash used in operations was approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  approximately million had been expended in capital to complete our mw production line and facility modifications  initial payments on our mw and one meter wide development and production tools  and acquisition and renovations to the thornton  colorado facility for our manufacturing expansion 
approximately million of the total million costs incurred in for our facility expansion was financed through a loan with chfa 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  restricted cash and investments 
we currently expect the capital expenditures needed to support the first mw of rated capacity will total approximately million to million for production and manufacturing equipment and approximately million for the acquisition of the building and renovations of our mw thornton facility 
we also expect capital expenditures of approximately million for installation  qualification and other associated pre operating expenses related to the expansion 
in addition  we have budgeted approximately million for the procurement and installation of the one meter wide manufacturing development tools  sources  and sensor control systems 
we made actual cash payments of approximately million for the mw production and manufacturing development tools as of december  and expect to make the remaining payments in and the first half of remaining expenditures to complete the thornton facility in are estimated to be approximately million 
during the year ended december   the use of cash for operational expenses averaged approximately  per month and were related to pre manufacturing activities  research and technology development  business development and general corporate expenses 
we expect operational expenses to increase in as we commence commercial production and increase the size of our workforce 
our average monthly operational expense for year ended december  of approximately  is net of average monthly r d revenues from our governmental contracts of approximately  and average monthly interest income net of interest expense of approximately  a significant component of our costs for the year ended december  related to the ongoing qualification of our mw line and continuing corporate costs related to building the required infrastructure to support our mw manufacturing operations and expansion plans 
we 
table of contents anticipate that our operational expenditures will continue to increase throughout due to the planned hiring of additional personnel for both our mw production line and the installation and qualification of our new mw of rated production capacity in thornton  colorado
