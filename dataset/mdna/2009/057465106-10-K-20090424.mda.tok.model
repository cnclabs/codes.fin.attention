cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors this annual report on form k includes  and our other periodic reports and public disclosures may contain  forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of which involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties or other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
you should not place undue reliance on those statements  which speak only as of the date on which they are made 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after such dates 
you should read this form k completely and with the understanding that our actual results may be materially different from what we expect 
we qualify all of our forward looking statements by these cautionary statements 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results  performances or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements our ability to identify and respond to changing consumer fashion preferences  our susceptibility to operating losses  
table of contents our ability to comply with the financial covenants under our lending arrangements  our ability to maintain adequate liquidity to operate our business as desired  the accuracy of our estimates regarding our capital requirements and needs for additional financing  our expectations regarding future financial results or performance  the execution of our business strategy  our ability to comply with the continued listing criteria of the nasdaq stock market  any of our other plans  objectives  expectations and intentions contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical facts  and changes in general economic and business conditions 
risk factors our failure to identify and respond to changing consumer fashion preferences in a timely manner would negatively impact our sales  profitability  liquidity and our image as a fashion resource for our customers 
the footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer fashion preferences 
our sales  net income and liquidity are sensitive to these changing preferences  which can be rapid and dramatic 
accordingly  we must identify and interpret fashion trends and respond in a timely manner 
we continually market new styles of footwear  but demand for and market acceptances of these new styles are uncertain 
our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer fashion preferences may result in lower sales  higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories  lower gross profits and negatively impact our financial liquidity 
conversely  if we fail to anticipate consumer demand for our products  we may experience inventory shortages  which would result in lost sales and could negatively impact our customer goodwill  our brand image and our profitability 
moreover  our business relies on continuous changes in fashion preferences 
stagnating consumer preferences could also result in lower sales and would require us to take higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories 
for example  in fiscal years   and our product offerings did not adequately reflect changes in consumer fashion trends  primarily sandals in the spring and for boots in the fall  which negatively impacted sales and profitability see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if our current positive sales trends are not maintained  we could fail to maintain a liquidity position adequate to support our ongoing operations 
our ability to maintain and ultimately improve our liquidity position is highly dependent on sustaining the positive sales trends that began in june and have continued through march our comparable store sales for the last three quarters of fiscal year increased and through the first ten weeks of fiscal year comparable stores sales increased 
however  our comparable store sales for fiscal year and fiscal year decreased and  respectively  and our comparable stores sales for the first quarter of fiscal year decreased 
our net losses in recent years have negatively impacted our liquidity and financial position 
at january   we had negative working capital of million  unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million  and our shareholders equity had declined to million 
if positive sales trends do not continue  or if we were to incur significant unplanned cash outlays  it would become necessary for us to obtain additional sources of liquidity  or take additional cost cutting measures 
any future financing would be subject to our financial results  market conditions and the consent of our lenders 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or we may only be able to obtain such financing on terms that are substantially dilutive to our current shareholders and that may further restrict our business activities 
if we cannot obtain needed financing  our operations may be materially negatively impacted and we may be forced into bankruptcy or to cease operations and you could lose your investment in the company 

table of contents the terms of our subordinated secured term loan contain certain financial covenants with respect to our performance and other covenants that restrict our activities 
if we are unable to comply with these covenants  we would have to negotiate an amendment to the loan agreement or the lender could accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness and subject us to a cross default under our credit facility 
our subordinated secured term loan contains certain financial covenants which require us to maintain specified levels of adjusted ebitda and tangible net worth both as defined in the loan agreement each fiscal quarter and annual limits on capital expenditures 
we are also subject to restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to pre pay other indebtedness  to dispose of assets  to effect certain corporate transactions  including specified mergers and sales of all or substantially all of our assets  to change the nature of our business  to pay dividends other than in the form of common stock dividends  as well as covenants that limit transactions with affiliates and prohibit a change of control as defined in the loan agreement 
the loan agreement generally provides for customary events of default  including default in the payment of principal or interest or other required payments  failure to observe or perform covenants or agreements contained in the transaction documents subject to certain limited exceptions  materially breaching our senior credit facility or the terms of our subordinated convertible debentures  generally failure to pay when due debt obligations broadly defined  subject to certain exceptions in excess of million  specified events of bankruptcy or specified judgments against us 
there is no assurance that we will be able to comply with our financial covenants 
in light of our historical sales volatility and the current state of the economy  we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that we may not be able to comply with our minimum adjusted ebitda covenant 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the term loan  the lender will be entitled to acceleration of the debt plus all accrued and unpaid interest  subject to a senior subordination agreement that was entered into with bank of america  na  with the interest rate increasing to per annum 
defaults under our term loan could also result in cross acceleration of our senior credit facility and our subordinated convertible debentures 
if an event of default occurs under the term loan  we may be unable to negotiate a mutually acceptable modification of the loan with the lender and we may not have sufficient funds to pay the total amount of accelerated obligations  and our lenders under the senior secured credit facility and subordinated secured term loan could proceed against the collateral securing the loan 
any acceleration in the repayment of our indebtedness or related foreclosure could adversely affect our business 
an amendment to maintain compliance with our loan covenants  if any  may be extremely expensive 
we have already negotiated two amendments with the lender in order to maintain compliance with the loan covenants  most recently in april in april we paid an amendment fee of  issued  shares of common stock and agreed to tighten future financial covenants in order to maintain compliance with our fourth quarter minimum adjusted ebitda covenant 
in order to obtain the consent of our senior lender  we also agreed to modify the terms of our senior credit facility  which included an increase in the interest rate and certain fees 
however  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional amendments in the future 
the report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm on our fiscal year financial statements contains language expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended january   states that our recent losses and our potential inability to comply with financial covenants raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset and liability amounts that might be necessary if we cease to function as a going concern 
see note to our financial statements 
this audit report could adversely affect our relationships with our landlords  our suppliers  our ability to raise additional capital and to execute our business plan  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  if we cease to function as a going concern you may lose your investment in the company 

table of contents our operations could be constrained by our ability to obtain funds under the terms of our revolving credit facility 
our business is seasonal  with a substantial portion of our profitability and cash flow occurring during our fourth quarter 
we rely on draws from our revolving credit facility to fund seasonal working capital requirements during our year 
draws on our credit facility are limited by both an overall limit of million and also by a calculated borrowing base that varies according to a formula based on inventory and accounts receivable and is generally less than the million overall limit 
as of january   we had an outstanding balance on our credit facility of million and unused borrowing capacity  calculated in accordance with the agreement  of million 
as of april   we had an outstanding balance of million and unused borrowing capacity of million 
to the extent we were to fail to generate sufficient cash from operating activities or from other financing activities  we could encounter availability constraints related to our operating activities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing activities 
our credit facility restricts our activities 
we have a million secured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na we routinely depend on our credit facility and may use a large percentage of the facility to fund our inventory purchases and our capital expenditures  especially prior to our selling seasons 
our credit facility includes financial and other customary covenants which  among other things require us to maintain a minimum availability  restrict our business activities and our ability to incur debt  make acquisitions  pay dividends  and repurchase our stock 
a change in control of our company  including any person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or our combined voting power as defined in the credit facility  is also prohibited 
in the event that we were to violate any of the covenants in our credit facility  or if other indebtedness in excess of million could be accelerated  or in the event that or more of our leases could be terminated other than solely as a result of certain sales of our common stock  the lender would have the right to accelerate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  or to commence foreclosure proceedings on our assets 
effective april   we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement which  among other things  extended its maturity date to january  for more information about our credit facility  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
a continued decline in general economic conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our footwear and accessories and could lead to reduced sales 
in addition to consumer fashion preferences  consumer spending habits are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  gas prices  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
the current slowdown in the united states economy and uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect consumer spending habits  which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
our overall profitability is highly dependent upon our fourth quarter results 
our fourth quarter sales volume tends to be significantly higher than our other quarters because our product offering during the holiday season tends to include our higher price point merchandise such as boots and customer traffic tends to be substantially higher during the holiday season 
consequently  we achieve our greatest leverage on fixed expenses and generate our highest profit levels during the fourth quarter 
should our product offerings not meet with customer acceptance during the fourth quarter  it would have a substantial negative impact on the overall results for the year 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  positive sales trends slowed considerably from mid december through year end resulting in lower than expected fourth quarter net sales and gross profit 

table of contents our operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations that can impact our profitability and liquidity 
in addition to customer shopping patterns  our quarterly results are affected by a variety of other factors  including fashion trends  the effectiveness of our inventory management  changes in our merchandise mix  weather conditions  changes in general economic conditions  and actions of competitors  mall anchor stores or co tenants 
due to factors such as these  our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
for example  net losses for each of the first three quarters of fiscal year were substantially greater than losses for the comparable quarters of fiscal year and net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year was substantially less than the fourth quarter of for more information  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
we are subject to risks associated with leasing our stores  including those stores where we acquired the lease through bankruptcy auctions 
we lease our store locations under individual leases 
approximately one half of our stores are located in properties managed by two national property management companies 
a number of our leases include termination and default provisions which apply if we do not meet certain sales levels  specified dilution in or changes of ownership of our company occur  or in other circumstances 
in addition  our leases subject us to risks relating to compliance with changing mall rules and the exercise of discretion by our landlords on various matters 
moreover  each year a significant portion of our leases are subject to renewal or termination 
if one or more of our landlords decides to terminate our leases  or to not allow us to renew  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we initially acquired many of our current leases from edison brothers  as debtor in possession  or from other bankrupt entities through auctions in which a bankruptcy court ordered the assignment of the debtor s interest in the leases to us 
as a result  we have not separately negotiated many of our leases  which are generally drafted in favor of the landlord 
our market share may be adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by low barriers to entry 
we compete against a diverse group of competitors  including national branded wholesalers  national specialty retailers  regional chains  national branded off price retailers  traditional department stores  discounters and apparel retailers 
many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
our market share and results of operations could be adversely impacted by this significant number of competitors or the introduction of new competitors 
for more information about our competition  please see business competition 
the departure of members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business 
the success of our business depends upon our senior management closely supervising all aspects of our business  in particular  the operation of our stores and the design  procurement and allocation of our merchandise 
retention of senior management is especially important in our business due to the limited availability of experienced and talented retail executives 
if we were to lose the services of peter edison  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  or other members of our senior management  our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to employ a suitable replacement in a timely manner 

table of contents our failure to maintain good relationships with our manufacturers could harm our ability to procure quality inventory in a timely manner 
our ability to obtain attractive pricing  quick response  ordering flexibility and other terms from our manufacturers depends on their perception of us and our buying agents 
we do not own any production facilities or have any long term contracts with any manufacturers  and we typically order our inventory through purchase orders 
any disruption in our supply chain could quickly impact our sales 
our failure or the failure of our buying agents to maintain good relationships with these manufacturers could increase our exposure to changing fashion cycles  which may lead to increased inventory markdown rates 
it is possible that we could be unable to acquire sufficient quantities or an appropriate mix of merchandise or raw materials at acceptable prices 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in this event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
we are also subject to risks related to the availability and use of materials and manufacturing processes for our products  including those which some may find objectionable 
we rely on a small number of buying agents and private label vendors for a substantial portion our merchandise purchases  and our failure to maintain good relationships with any of them could harm our ability to source our products 
for fiscal year  five buying agents private label vendors accounted for approximately of our merchandise purchases  with one private label vendor accounting for approximately of our merchandise purchases 
our buying agents and private label vendors assist in developing our private label merchandise  arrange for the purchase of necessary materials and contract with manufacturers 
we execute nonexclusive agreements with some of our buying agents 
these agreements prohibit our buying agents from sharing commissions with manufacturers  owning stock or holding any ownership interest in  or being owned in any way by  any of our manufacturers or suppliers 
the agreements do not prohibit our buying agents from acting as agents for other purchasers  which could negatively impact our sales 
if they were to disclose our plans or designs to our competitors  our sales may be materially adversely impacted 
the loss of any of these key buying agents or a breach by them of our buying agent agreements could adversely affect our ability to develop or obtain merchandise 
our merchandise is manufactured by foreign manufacturers  therefore  the availability and costs of our products may be negatively affected by risks associated with international trade 
although all of our stores are located in the united states  virtually all of our merchandise is produced in china  brazil  italy  spain and other foreign countries 
therefore  we are subject to the risks associated with international trade  which include adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in import tariffs  duties or quotas  the imposition of taxes or other charges on imports  the imposition of restrictive trade policies or sanctions by the united states on one or more of the countries from which we obtain footwear and accessories  expropriation or nationalization  compliance with and changes in import restrictions and regulations  exposure to different legal standards and the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and changing foreign government policies  international hostilities  war or terrorism and pirates  changes in foreign governments  regulations  political unrest  work stoppages  shipment disruption or delays  and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our manufacturers and suppliers are located 

table of contents our imported products are subject to united states customs duties  which make up a material portion of the cost of the merchandise 
if customs duties are substantially increased  it would harm our profitability 
the united states and the countries in which our products are produced may impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty  or tariff levels  any of which could have a harmful effect on our profitability 
furthermore  when declaring the duties owed on and the classifications of our imported products  we make various good faith assumptions 
we regularly employ a third party to review our customs declarations  and we will notify the appropriate authorities if any erroneous declarations are revealed 
however  the customs authorities retain the right to audit our declarations  which could result in additional tariffs  duties and or penalties if the authorities believe that they have discovered any errors 
continued decline in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies  especially the chinese yuan could negatively impact our gross margins 
the value of the united states dollar has declined relative to the chinese yuan since our initial public offering in although our inventory purchase transactions are denominated in united states dollars which eliminates exchange rate risks on established contracts  the decline in the value of the united states dollar has resulted in increases in the costs of our chinese sourced products 
in the event of a continued decline in the united states dollar or economy  it may mot be possible for us to increase or maintain an increase in our average selling prices sufficient to fully or partially reflect these cost increases 
to the extent that we are unable to offset such cost increases there would be a negative impact on our gross margins 
our reliance on manufacturers in china exposes us to supply risks 
manufacturing facilities in china produce a significant portion of our products 
generally  a substantial majority of our private label footwear units are manufactured in china and virtually all of our private label accessories are manufactured in china each year 
the chinese economy is subject to periodic energy and labor shortages  as well as transportation and shipping bottlenecks 
in prior years  there have been delays at ports on the west coast of the united states 
these matters  changes in the chinese government or economy  or the current tariff or duty structures or adoption by the united states of trade polices or sanctions adverse to china  could harm our ability to obtain inventory in a timely and cost effective manner 
our ability to expand into some territorial and foreign jurisdictions under the trademarks bakers and wild pair is restricted 
when we acquired selected assets of the bakers and wild pair chains from edison brothers stores  inc in a bankruptcy auction in june  we were assigned title to and the right to use the trademarks bakers  the wild pair  wild pair and other trademarks to the extent owned by edison brothers at that time 
our rights to use the trademarks are subject to a concurrent use agreement which recognizes the geographical division of the trademarks between us and a puerto rican company 
at approximately the same time as we acquired our rights and title  edison brothers also assigned to the puerto rican company title to and the right to use the trademarks  subject to the concurrent use agreement 
under the concurrent use agreement  we and the puerto rican company agree that the puerto rican company has the exclusive right to use the trademarks in the commonwealth of puerto rico  the us virgin islands  central and south america  cuba  the dominican republic  the bahamas  the lesser antilles and jamaica and that we have the exclusive right to use the trademarks in the united states and throughout the world  except for the territories and jurisdictions in which the puerto rican company was assigned the rights 
consequently  we do not have the right to use the trademarks bakers and wild pair in those territories and foreign jurisdictions in which the puerto rican company owns the trademark rights  which may limit our growth 
our potential inability or failure to renew  register or otherwise protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names 
because the trademarks assigned to us by edison brothers are subject to the concurrent use agreement  the us trademark applications and registrations are jointly owned by us and a puerto rican company  which could 
table of contents impair our ability to renew and enforce the assigned applications and registrations 
simultaneously with the puerto rican company  we have filed separate concurrent use applications for the bakers and wild pair trademarks  and we have requested that existing applications for the trademark bakers also be divided territorially 
while we are in agreement with the puerto rican company that confusion is not likely to result from concurrent use of the trademarks in our respective territories  the united states patent and trademark office may not agree with our position 
if we are not able to register or renew our trademark registrations  our ability to prevent others from using trademarks and to capitalize on the value of our brand names may be impaired 
further  our rights in the trademarks could be subject to security interests granted by the puerto rican company 
our potential inability or failure to renew  register or otherwise protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could negatively impact the value of our brand names 
we would be adversely affected if our distribution operations were disrupted 
the efficient operation of our stores is dependent on our ability to distribute merchandise manufactured overseas to locations throughout the united states in a timely manner 
we depend on third parties to ship  receive and distribute substantially all of our merchandise 
a third party operating in china manages the shipping of merchandise from china either to a third party operating our los angeles  california distribution center or for delivery directly to our stores through los angeles 
the third party in los angeles  california accepts delivery of a significant portion of our merchandise from asia  and another third party near philadelphia  pennsylvania accepts delivery of our merchandise from elsewhere 
these parties located in the united states have provided these services to us pursuant to written agreements since and one of these agreements is terminable upon days notice 
we also continue to operate under the terms of an expired agreement with the remaining third party 
merchandise not shipped to our stores is shipped to our company operated warehouse 
we also rely on our computer network to coordinate the distribution of our products 
if we need to replace one of our third party service providers  if our warehouse or computer network is shut down for any reason or does not operate efficiently  our operations could be disrupted for a substantial period of time while we identify and integrate a replacement into our system 
any such disruption could materially negatively impact our ability to maintain sufficient inventory in our stores and consequently our profitability 
we may be subject to liability under our registration statements 
we currently have three registration statements relating to our incentive plans and three selling shareholder registration statements in effect  including a registration statement relating to  shares of our common stock that were issued to the lender under our subordinated secured term loan as additional consideration for the loan and an amendment thereto 
under this registration rights agreement  we may be subject to liquidated damages penalties through february  equal to of the value of the registrable shares remaining based on an aggregate value of  for each day period prorated for partial periods if the registration statement ceases to be effective for more than days per year or more than consecutive calendar days  subject to our right to suspend use of the registration statement for certain periods of time in certain circumstances  or if our common stock ceases to be traded on an eligible market 
there is no assurance that our common stock will continue to be listed on the nasdaq stock market 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq global market 
the nasdaq stock market has minimum requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on the nasdaq global market 
these requirements include maintaining a minimum closing bid price of per share 
the closing bid price of our common stock on april  was per share 
please see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities below for additional information on the price range of our common stock since february  these requirements also include maintaining a minimum market value of publicly held shares  and  as of april   we did not meet this minimum requirement 
although nasdaq has temporarily suspended the minimum closing bid price and minimum market value of publicly held shares requirements until july   there can be no assurance that we will meet these requirements after such date 
if our common stock is delisted  the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected  the market 
table of contents price of our common stock could decrease  and our ability to obtain adequate financing for the continuation of our operations could be impaired 
the market price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected by market volatility 
the market price of our common stock is expected to be highly volatile  both because of actual and perceived changes in our financial results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price may include  among other factors discussed in this section  the following actual or anticipated variations in comparable store sales or operating results  changes in financial estimates by research analysts  actual or anticipated changes in the united states economy or the retailing environment  changes in the market valuations of other footwear or retail companies  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  divestitures  joint ventures  financing transactions  securities offerings or other strategic initiatives 
we are controlled by a small group of shareholders whose interests may differ from other shareholders 
a substantial portion of our stock ownership is concentrated among a relatively small number of mutual funds and hedge funds whose interests may differ from our other shareholders or could impact our company including any potential change of control 
accordingly  these shareholders will continue to have significant influence in determining the outcome of all matters submitted to shareholders for approval  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions 
the interests of these shareholders may differ from the interests of other shareholders  and their concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that may be favored by other shareholders 
as long as these people are among our principal shareholders  they will have the power to significantly influence the election of our entire board of directors 
peter edison s employment agreement entitles him to a one time payment equal to three times his current base salary as defined in the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events  including following a change of control of the company if there is generally a material reduction in the nature of his duties or his base salary  or he is not allowed to participate in certain bonus plans 
for this purpose  a change of control generally includes the acquisition by a person or group of more of our common stock than that held by peter edison 
more than one of our shareholders has filed a schedule d or g reporting beneficial ownership in an amount in excess of that beneficially owned by peter edison and our current management 
the public sale of our common stock by selling shareholders could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of market sales by our shareholders  including under our resale registration statements  or the perception that these sales will occur 
these sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
there is relatively limited trading in our common stock 
the trading volume of our common stock is relatively limited  which we expect to continue 
therefore  our stock may be subject to higher volatility or illiquidity than would exist if our shares were traded more actively 
our charter documents and missouri law may inhibit a takeover  which may cause a decline in the value of our stock 
provisions of our restated articles of incorporation  our restated bylaws and missouri law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if closing the transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders 
for example  our restated articles of incorporation provide  in part  that directors may be removed from office by our shareholders only for cause and by the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of our outstanding shares and that 
table of contents vacancies may be filled only by a majority of remaining directors 
under our restated bylaws  shareholders must follow detailed notice and other requirements to nominate a candidate for director or to make shareholder proposals 
in addition  among other requirements  our restated bylaws require at least a two thirds vote of shareholders to call a special meeting 
moreover  missouri law and our bylaws provide that any action by written consent must be unanimous 
furthermore  our bylaws may be amended only by our board of directors 
certain amendments to our articles of incorporation require the vote of two thirds of our outstanding shares in certain circumstances  including the provisions of our articles of incorporation relating to business combinations  directors  bylaws  limitations on director liabilities and amendments to our articles of incorporation 
we are also generally subject to the business combination provisions under missouri law  which allow our board of directors to retain discretion over the approval of certain business combinations 
in our bylaws  we have elected to not be subject to the control shares acquisition provision under missouri law  which would deny an acquiror voting rights with respect to any shares of voting stock which increase its equity ownership to more than specified thresholds 
these and other provisions of missouri law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws  our board s authority to issue preferred stock and the lack of cumulative voting in our articles of incorporation may have the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board or otherwise to bring a matter before shareholders without our board s consent 
such items may reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited takeover proposal and may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

we used the net proceeds received from the initial public offering to repay million on our revolving credit agreement  million to redeem outstanding warrants  million to repay subordinated debt and million for capital expenditures 
immediately prior to our initial public offering  we had three classes of common stock authorized  class a common stock  class b common stock and class c common stock  of which only shares of class a and class b common stock were outstanding 
upon the consummation of our initial public offering  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock automatically converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock on a for basis  excluding fractional shares 
mandatory redemption rights in favor of certain holders of prior class a and class b common stock were also terminated 
in addition  upon the consummation of our initial public offering  million in aggregate principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures due were

further  in connection with the closing of our initial public offering  we sold to the representatives of the underwriters and their designees warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  subject to antidilution adjustments  for a purchase price of per warrant 
all unexercised warrants have now expired 
on march   we changed our fiscal year to the saturday closest to january previously our fiscal year ended four weeks earlier 
as a result of this change  we had a four week transition period ended january  we believe that the change in our fiscal year end does not impact the comparability of the five fiscal years presented in this table 
for the four week transition period ended january   net sales were  gross profit was  loss before income taxes was  benefit from income taxes was  net loss was  and net loss per common share on both a basic and diluted basis was

at january   total assets were  unaudited and long term debt and capital lease obligations  less current portion was  unaudited 
on april   we sold  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to certain investors in a private placement for gross proceeds of  the warrants have an exercise price of per share and  subject to certain conditions  expire on april  we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of to the placement agent 
the net proceeds after placement fees and expenses were  we used the proceeds to finance new store expansion and remodel existing stores into our new format 
we base our fiscal year on a week period 
the fiscal year ended february  was a week period

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item business cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors and item business risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by this more detailed information and our financial statements and the related notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a national  mall based  specialty retailer of distinctive footwear and accessories targeting young women who demand quality fashion products 
we feature private label and national brand dress  casual and sport shoes  boots  sandals and accessories 
as of january   we operated stores  including the store wild pair chain that targets men and women between the ages of and who desire edgier  fashion forward footwear 
as of april  we operated stores  including wild pair stores 
we incurred net losses of million and in fiscal years and  but made significant progress during in refocusing our inventory lines and maintaining cost control 
since june  we have achieved positive comparable store sales each month through march for fiscal year we increased gross margin by basis points and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by basis points as a percentage of sales despite being negatively impacted by the sharp economic slowdown during the year  especially as it dramatically impacted customer demand and competitive pricing pressures beginning in mid december and continuing through year end 
as a consequence  our fourth quarter sales and gross profit were each over million below what we had anticipated at the end of the third quarter 
we took aggressive promotional actions to maintain control of inventory levels at year end  which resulted in disappointing fourth quarter results  but placed us in a good inventory position to start the first quarter of fiscal year our losses in fiscal years and had a significant negative impact on our financial position and liquidity 
as of january   we had negative working capital of million  unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million  and our shareholders equity had declined to million 
in fiscal year  we obtained net proceeds of million from the entry into a million three year subordinated secured term loan and the issuance of  shares of common stock 
on may   we amended the subordinated secured term loan to reduce the financial covenant for minimum adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of fiscal year to maintain compliance as of may  and to defer principal payments until september  as consideration for the amendment  we issued an additional  shares of common stock 
on april   subsequent to year end  we again amended the subordinated secured term loan to reduce the financial covenant for minimum adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of fiscal year in order to maintain compliance at january  as consideration for the amendment  we paid a fee of  and issued an additional  shares of common stock 
the amendment also tightened the minimum adjusted ebitda covenants and tangible net worth covenants and reduced the capital expenditure covenants for fiscal years and in addition  on april   we amended our revolving credit agreement  extending the expiration date to january from august and obtaining the senior lender s consent to the amendment of the subordinated secured term loan 
the amendment also increased our interest rate from the bank s prime rate to prime plus  increased our unused line fee from to  reduced the overall facility from million to million  eliminated the grace period for failing to maintain minimum availability levels  and reduced the advance rate during the fourth quarter 
in connection with this amendment  we paid  in fees 
as of april   the balance on our revolving line of credit was million and our unused borrowing capacity was million 
our business plan for fiscal year is based on a continuation of the mid single digit increases in comparable store sales  which began in the second quarter of fiscal year  through the remainder of the year 
fiscal year comparable store sales through april  are up consistent with our business plan  under which we expect to maintain adequate levels of liquidity for the remainder of fiscal year our business plan also reflects continued focus on inventory management and on timely promotional activity 
we believe this focus on 
table of contents inventory should improve our overall gross margin performance compared to fiscal year our plan includes continued control over selling  general and administrative expenses which are expected to continue to benefit from cost reductions initiated in we are also working with our landlords and vendors to arrange payment terms that are reflective of our seasonal cash flow patterns in order to manage our availability 
our business plan for fiscal year reflects a significant improvement in cash flow  but does not indicate a return to profitability 
however  there is no assurance that we will achieve the sales margin or cash flow contemplated in our business plan 
we continue to face considerable liquidity constraints 
although we believe our business plan is achievable  should we fail to achieve the sales or gross margin levels we anticipate  or if we were to incur significant unplanned cash outlays  it would become necessary for us to obtain additional sources of liquidity or make further cost cuts to fund our operations 
however  there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all  or to successfully further reduce costs in such a way that would continue to allow us to operate our business 
see item business risk factors if our current positive sales trends are not maintained  we could fail to maintain a liquidity position adequate to support our ongoing operations herein 
our subordinated secured term loan includes certain financial covenants which require us to maintain specified levels of adjusted ebitda and tangible net worth each fiscal quarter and provides for annual limits on capital expenditures all as calculated in accordance with the loan agreement 
based on our business plan for the remainder of the year and our other actions  we believe that we will be able to comply with our financial covenants 
however  given the inherent volatility in our sales performance  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
furthermore  in light of our historical sales volatility and the current state of the economy  we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that we may not be able to comply with our minimum adjusted ebitda covenant 
failure to comply would be a default under the terms of our term loan and could result in the acceleration of our term loan  and possibly all of our debt obligations 
if we are unable to comply with our financial covenants  we will be required to seek one or more amendments or waivers from our lenders 
we believe that we would be able to obtain any required amendments or waivers  but can give no assurance that we would be able to do so on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any required amendments or waivers  our lenders would have the right to exercise remedies specified in the loan agreements  including accelerating the repayment of our debt obligations and taking collection actions against us 
if such acceleration occurred  we currently have insufficient cash to pay the amounts owed and would be forced to obtain alternative financing as discussed above 
as a result of these uncertainties  our long term debt obligations have been classified as current liabilities 
please see item business risk factors the terms of our subordinated secured term loan contain certain financial covenants with respect to our performance and other covenants that restrict our activities 
if we are unable to comply with these covenants  we would have to negotiate an amendment to the loan agreement or the lender could accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness and subject us to a cross default under our credit facility herein 
our independent registered public accounting firm s report issued in this annual report on form k included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  including our recent losses and our potential inability to comply with financial covenants 
see note to our financial statements 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets carrying amounts or the amount of and classification of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
we have taken several steps that we believe will be sufficient to allow us to continue as a going concern and to improve our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
see item business risk factors the report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm on our fiscal year financial statements contains language expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern herein 
we operate on a week fiscal year 
fiscal years and were week periods while fiscal year was a week period 
we believe that the fifty third week of fiscal year does not materially affect the comparisons of fiscal year to fiscal years and in our discussion and analysis of results of operations 
for comparison purposes  we classify our stores as comparable or non comparable 
a new store s sales are not included in comparable store sales until the thirteenth month of operation 
sales from remodeled stores are excluded from comparable store sales during the period of remodeling 
we include our internet and catalog sales as one store in calculating our comparable store sales 
comparable store sales for fiscal year compare the fifty two week 
table of contents period ended january  to the fifty two week period ended february  comparable store sales for fiscal year compare the fifty two week period ended february  to the fifty two week period ended february  critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
for more information  please see note in the notes to the financial statements 
we believe that our application of accounting policies  and the estimates that are inherently required by these policies  are reasonable 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out retail inventory method 
consideration received from vendors relating to inventory purchases is recorded as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold  occupancy  and buying expenses after an agreement with the vendor is executed and when the related inventory is sold 
we physically count all merchandise inventory on hand twice annually  generally during the months of january and july  and adjust the recorded balance to reflect the results of the physical counts 
we record estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts based on historical results 
inventory shrinkage is included as a component of cost of merchandise sold  occupancy  and buying costs 
permanent markdowns are recorded to reflect expected adjustments to retail prices in accordance with the retail inventory method 
in determining permanent markdowns  we consider current and recently recorded sales prices  the length of time product is held in inventory  and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory  among other factors 
the process of determining our expected adjustments to retail prices requires significant judgment by management 
the ultimate amount realized from the sale of inventories could differ materially from our estimates 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory markdowns may be required 
store closing and impairment charges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
we regularly analyze the operating results of our stores and assess the viability of under performing stores to determine whether they should be closed or whether their associated assets  including furniture  fixtures  equipment  and leasehold improvements  have been impaired 
asset impairment tests are performed at least annually  on a store by store basis 
after allowing for an appropriate start up period  unusual nonrecurring events  and favorable trends  fixed assets of stores indicated to be impaired are written down to fair value 
during the years ended february   february  and january   we recorded   and  respectively  in noncash charges to earnings related to the impairment of long lived assets 
stock based compensation expense on january   the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r which requires us to recognize compensation expense for stock based compensation based on the grant date fair value 
stock based compensation expense is then recognized ratably over the service period related to each grant 
we used the modified prospective transition method under which financial statements covering periods prior to adoption have not been restated 
we determine the fair value of stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make assumptions regarding future dividends  expected volatility of our stock  and the expected lives of the options 
under sfas r we also make assumptions regarding 
table of contents the number of options and the number of shares of restricted stock and performance shares that will ultimately vest 
the assumptions and calculations required by sfas r are complex and require a high degree of judgment 
assumptions regarding the vesting of grants are accounting estimates that must be updated as necessary with any resulting change recognized as an increase or decrease in compensation expense at the time the estimate is changed 
sfas r also requires that excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises be reflected as financing cash inflows and operating cash outflows 
during fiscal year and fiscal year  we made grants of performance shares under our incentive compensation plan 
based upon the degree of achievement of performance objectives for net sales and return on average assets through performance periods through fiscal year  we will issue a total of between zero and  shares of common stock under these performance share grants 
during fiscal year  we granted  shares of restricted stock under our incentive compensation plan 
during fiscal years   and  we granted   and  stock options  respectively  under our stock option plan 
as of january   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation is  and the weighted average period over which this compensation is expected to be recognized is years 
deferred income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of deferred taxes are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
in accordance with sfas  we regularly assesses available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset balances will be recovered from a reversals of deferred tax liabilities  b potential utilization of net operating loss carrybacks  c tax planning strategies and d future taxable income 
sfas places significant restrictions on the consideration of future taxable income in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets in situations where a company has experienced a cumulative loss in recent years 
when sufficient negative evidence exists that indicates that full realization of deferred tax assets is no longer more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established as necessary against the deferred tax assets  increasing our income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached 
subsequently  the valuation allowance is adjusted up or down as necessary to maintain coverage against the deferred tax assets 
if  in the future  sufficient positive evidence  such as a sustained return to profitability  arises that would indicate that realization of deferred tax assets is once again more likely than not  any existing valuation allowance would be reversed as appropriate  decreasing our income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached 
at february   we had adequate available net operating loss carryback potential to support the recorded balance of net deferred tax assets 
our loss before income taxes in fiscal year exceeded our loss carryback potential and resulted in a cumulative loss before income taxes for the three year period ending february  based on this factor and after evaluating other available evidence  we concluded that the realizability of net deferred tax assets was no longer more likely than not  and established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we have scheduled the reversals of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and have concluded that based on the anticipated reversals  a valuation allowance is necessary only for the excess of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities 
we anticipate that until we re establish a pattern of continuing profitability  in accordance with sfas  we will not recognize any material income tax expense or benefit in our statement of operations for future periods  as pretax profits or losses generally will generate tax effects that will be offset by decreases or increases in the valuation allowance with no net effect on the statement of operations 
if a pattern of continuing profitability is re established and we conclude that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets are realizable  we will 
table of contents reverse any remaining valuation allowance which will result in the recognition of an income tax benefit in the period that it occurs 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions  as defined 
fin requires  among other matters  that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we became subject to the provisions of fin as of february   the beginning of fiscal year  and we analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
our federal income tax returns subsequent to the fiscal year ended january  remain open 
as of january  and february   we did not record any unrecognized tax benefits 
our policy  if we had unrecognized benefits  is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and other expense  respectively 
fiscal year our fiscal year is based upon a week retail calendar  ending on the saturday nearest january the fiscal years ended january  fiscal year and february  fiscal year are week periods 
the fiscal year ended february  fiscal year was a week period 
we believe that the fifty third week of fiscal year does not materially affect comparisons with fiscal year and fiscal year results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of sales  for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended february  february  january  net sales cost of merchandise sold  occupancy and buying expense gross profit selling expense general and administrative expense gain loss on disposal of property and equipment impairment of long lived assets operating loss other income  net interest expense provision for benefit from income taxes net loss 
table of contents the following table sets forth our number of stores at the beginning and end of each period indicated and the number of stores opened  acquired and closed during each period indicated 
fiscal year ended february  february  january  number of stores at beginning of period stores opened or acquired during period stores closed during period number of stores at end of period fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended february  net sales 
net sales were million in fiscal year  down from million for fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
comparable store sales in fiscal year increased compared to a decrease in fiscal year sales reflected weak customer response to early spring offerings  strong sandal sales during the summer months  favorable sales trends across all key categories  particularly in boots and dress shoes during the fall  which slowed considerably from mid december through year end as economic conditions negatively affected sales throughout the retail sector 
average unit selling prices increased reflecting higher price points and stronger regular price sales compared to fiscal year unit sales volume decreased 
our internet and catalog sales increased to million in fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year principal components of the increase in gross margin dollars in fiscal year are a million increase from improved gross margin percentage  a million increase from higher comparable store sales  offset by a million decrease in gross profit from net store closings 
permanent markdown costs were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  reflecting the stronger regular price sales across all categories of footwear in fiscal year and the impact of the significant pricing actions taken during fiscal year selling expense 
selling expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in direct marketing costs  a million decrease in store payroll expenses  a million decrease in store depreciation expense  a million decrease in store supplies and repairs  and a million decrease in other marketing expenses 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expense decreased to from in fiscal year the decrease was primarily the result of million of lower payroll costs  and million of lower depreciation 
gain loss on disposal of property and equipment 
loss on disposal of property and equipment was million in fiscal year compared to a gain of million in fiscal year the loss in fiscal year relates to expensing leasehold improvements and store fixtures due to store closings 
the gain in fiscal year relates to the termination of a long term below market operating lease in december impairment of long lived assets 
during fiscal year we recognized million in noncash charges related to the impairment of fixed assets and other assets at specific underperforming stores 
impairment expense in fiscal year was million 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  an increase of million 
the increase in interest expense reflects the interest on our subordinated secured term loan entered into in february and our subordinated convertible debentures issued in june the increase was slightly offset by the decrease in average borrowings and average interest rate under our revolving credit facility compared to the prior year 

table of contents income tax expense 
we recognized million in income tax expense compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal year the income tax expense in fiscal year reflects differences between the alternative minimum tax and realized operating loss carrybacks recognized in the income tax provision and the income tax returns filed for fiscal year the income tax expense for fiscal year reflects the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
net loss 
we had a net loss of million in fiscal year compared to net loss of million in fiscal year fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  net sales 
net sales were million in fiscal year  down from million for fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
comparable store sales in fiscal year decreased compared to a decrease in fiscal year continued weakness in demand for our sandal line during the spring season and lower than expected demand for our fall offerings were the primary causes for the comparable store sales decrease 
average unit selling prices decreased reflecting lower price points resulting from greater promotional discounting compared to fiscal year unit sales volume decreased 
our internet and catalog sales increased to million in fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year demand for our spring and fall product lines was much weaker than anticipated  resulting in higher than optimal inventory levels in the third quarter 
in september  we aggressively reviewed our existing inventory and took pricing actions that we believe were required to provide the freshness in product that our customers desire and facilitate the reduction of our inventory levels 
this significantly reduced gross margin achieved in fiscal year but resulted in a decrease in inventory the end of fiscal year compared to the end of fiscal year principal components of the change in gross margin in fiscal year are million of incremental gross profit from new stores  offset by a million decrease in gross profit from lower comparable store sales and a million decrease in gross profit from reduced margins resulting from increased promotional activity 
permanent markdown costs were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  reflecting the decrease in net sales 
selling expense 
selling expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in catalog production and mailing costs as we increased the number and size of catalog mailings and a million increase in store depreciation expense  offset by decreases of million in store payroll expenses and million in store supplies 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expense increased to from in fiscal year as a result of lower leverage 
gain loss on disposal of property and equipment 
gain on disposal of property and equipment was million in fiscal year compared to a loss million in fiscal year the gain in fiscal year relates primarily to the gain from the termination of a long term below market operating lease in december and the loss in fiscal year relates to expensing leasehold improvements and store fixtures due to store closings and remodelings 
impairment of long lived assets 
during fiscal year we recognized million in noncash charges related to the impairment of long lived assets of underperforming stores  including three prototype stores that we determined to no longer be consistent with our strategic focus 
the prototype locations will be converted into wild pair stores in impairment expense in fiscal year was million 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  an increase of million 
the increase in interest expense reflects the increase in our average borrowings on our revolving credit facility and interest on our subordinated convertible debentures issued in june 
table of contents income tax expense benefit 
we established a million tax valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in fiscal year consequently  we recognized million of income tax expense in fiscal year compared to a million income tax benefit recognized in fiscal year net loss 
we had a net loss of million in fiscal year compared to net loss of million in fiscal year seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the following table sets forth our summary operating results for the quarterly periods indicated 
fiscal year ended february  thirteen thirteen thirteen fourteen weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended april  july  october  february  net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss fiscal year ended february  thirteen thirteen thirteen thirteen weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended may  august  november  february  net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss fiscal year ended january  thirteen thirteen thirteen weeks thirteen weeks weeks ended weeks ended ended ended may  august  november  january  net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss during the second and third quarters of fiscal year and the third quarter of fiscal year we recognized   and  respectively in noncash charges related to the impairment of long lived assets of underperforming stores 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an agreement to terminate a long term below market operating lease  in exchange for a million cash payment  and the right to continue occupying the space through january  we recognized a net gain of million from this transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which is reflected as a component of operating expenses 
our operating results are subject to significant seasonal variations 
our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  as a result of these seasonal variances  in particular our principal selling seasons 
we have five principal selling seasons transition post holiday  easter  back to school  fall and holiday 
quarterly comparisons may also be affected by the timing of sales promotions and costs associated with remodeling stores  opening new stores or acquiring stores 
sales and operating results in our third quarter are typically much weaker than in our other quarters 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  capital expenditures and principal and interest payments on our debt obligations 
historically  these cash needs have been met by cash flows from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of securities 
as discussed below in financing activities the balance on our revolving credit facility fluctuates throughout the year as a result of our seasonal working capital requirements and our other uses of cash 
our losses in fiscal year and fiscal year have had a significant negative impact on our financial position and liquidity 
as of january   we had negative working capital of million  unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million  and our shareholders equity had declined to million 
in order to address our liquidity  in fiscal year  we obtained net proceeds of million from the entry into a million three year subordinated secured term loan and the issuance of  shares of common stock 
on may   we amended the subordinated secured term loan to reduce the financial covenant for minimum adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of fiscal year to maintain compliance as of may  and to defer principal payments until september  as consideration for the amendment  we issued an additional  shares of common stock 
on april   subsequent to year end  we again amended the subordinated secured term loan to reduce the financial covenant for minimum adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of fiscal year in order to maintain compliance at january  as consideration for the amendment  we paid a fee of  and issued an additional  shares of common stock 
the amendment also tightened the minimum adjusted ebitda covenants and tangible net worth covenants and reduced the capital expenditure covenants for fiscal years and in addition  on april  we amended our revolving credit agreement  extending the expiration date to january from august and obtaining the senior lender s approval of the amendment to our subordinated secured term loan 
the amendment also increased our interest rate from the bank s prime rate to prime plus  increased our unused line fee from to  reduced the overall facility from million to million  eliminated the grace period for failing to maintain minimum availability levels  and reduced the advance rate during the fourth quarter 
in connection with this amendment  we paid  in fees 
as of april   the balance on the revolving credit facility was million and unused borrowing capacity was million 
our business plan for fiscal year is based on a continuation of the mid single digit increases in comparable store sales which began in the second quarter of fiscal year through the remainder of the year 
fiscal year comparable store sales through april  are up consistent with our business plan  under which we expect to maintain adequate levels of liquidity for the remainder of fiscal year our business plan also reflects continued focus on inventory management and on timely promotional activity 
we believe that this focus on inventory should improve our overall gross margin performance compared to fiscal year our plan includes continued control over selling  general and administrative expenses which are expected to continue to benefit from cost reductions initiated in we are also working with our landlords and vendors to arrange payment terms that are reflective of our seasonal cash flow patterns in order to best manage our availability 
our business plan for fiscal year reflects a significant improvement in cash flow  but does not indicate a return to profitability 
however  there is no assurance that we will achieve the sales  margin or cash flow contemplated in our business plan 
we continue to face considerable liquidity constraints 
although we believe our business plan is achievable  should we fail to achieve the sales or gross margin levels we anticipate  or if we were to incur significant unplanned cash outlays  it would become necessary for us to obtain additional sources of liquidity or make further cost cuts to fund our operations 
however  there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all  or to successfully further reduce costs in such a way that would continue to allow us to operate our business 
see item business risk factors if our current positive sales trends are not maintained  we could fail to maintain a liquidity position adequate to support our ongoing operations herein 
our subordinated secured term loan includes certain financial covenants which require us to maintain specified levels of adjusted ebitda and tangible net worth each fiscal quarter and provides for annual limits on capital expenditures all as calculated in accordance with the loan agreement 
based on our business plan for fiscal year  we believe that we will be able to comply with our financial covenants 
however  given the inherent volatility 
table of contents in our sales performance  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in addition  in light of our historical sales volatility and the current state of the economy  we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that we may not be able to comply with our minimum adjusted ebitda financial covenant 
failure to comply would be a default under the terms of our term loan and could result in the acceleration of our term loan  and possibly all of our debt obligations 
if we are unable to comply with our financial covenants  we will be required to seek one or more amendments or waivers from our lenders 
we believe that we would be able to obtain any required amendments or waivers  but can give no assurance that we would be able to do so on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any required amendments or waivers  our lenders would have the right to exercise remedies specified in the loan agreements  including accelerating the repayment of our debt obligations and taking collection action against us 
if such acceleration occurred  we currently have insufficient cash to pay the amounts owed and would be forced to obtain alternative financing as discussed above 
as a result of these uncertainties  our long term debt obligations have been classified as current liabilities 
please see subordinated secured term loan herein and item business risk factors the terms of our subordinated secured term loan contain certain financial covenants with respect to our performance and other covenants that restrict our activities 
if we are unable to comply with these covenants  we would have to negotiate an amendment to the loan agreement or the lender could accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness and subject us to a cross default under our credit facility

there was a million increase in inventory  a net reduction in prepaid income tax assets of million  and a million reduction of accounts payable  accrued expenses and accrued rent liabilities from the balances at the end of fiscal year 
table of contents our inventories at january  increased to million from million at february  we believe that at january   inventory levels and valuations are appropriate given current and anticipated sales trends  however  there is always the possibility that fashion trends could change suddenly 
we monitor our inventory levels closely and will take appropriate actions  including taking additional markdowns  as necessary  to maintain the freshness of our inventory

we are committed under noncancelable operating leases for all store and office spaces 
these leases expire at various dates through and generally provide for minimum rent plus payments for real estate taxes and operating expenses  subject to escalations 
some of our leases also require us to pay contingent rent based on sales 
as of january   our lease payment obligations under these leases totaled approximately million for fiscal year  and an aggregate of approximately million through our ability to meet our current and anticipated operating requirements will depend on our future performance  which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control

on december   we entered into an agreement to terminate a long term below market operating lease in exchange for a million cash payment received on december  and the right to continue occupying the space through january  we used the net proceeds of approximately million to reduce the balance on our revolving line of credit 
we do not believe that we have any other operating leases that could be terminated on substantially similar terms 
we have limited our planned capital expenditures for fiscal year to opening one new store 
our future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
we continuously evaluate our future capital expenditure plans and adjust planned expenditures  as necessary  based on business conditions 
as of april   we have opened one new store in fiscal year we remodeled two stores during fiscal year as of april   we have not remodeled any stores in fiscal year we currently project our capital expenditures in fiscal year to be approximately million

table of contents revolving credit facility we have a senior secured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na successor by merger to fleet retail finance inc 
in order to obtain the bank s consent to an amendment to our subordinated secured term loan  on april  we amended our credit facility to extend the maturity from august  to january   reduce the credit ceiling from million to million  generally increase the interest rate from the bank s prime rate to the prime rate plus  eliminate a grace period for failing to maintain a minimum availability and implement other amendments to the agreement  including increasing certain fees 
amounts borrowed under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to the base rate as defined in the agreement plus a margin amount 
under the amendment  the base rate was revised so that it equals the greater of the bank s prime rate  the federal funds rate plus or the libor rate plus all as defined in the agreement 
also under the amendment  the base rate margin was changed from to up to 
the revolving credit facility also allows us to apply an interest rate based on libor as defined in the agreement plus a margin amount to a designated portion of the outstanding balance as set forth in the agreement 
under the amendment  the libor margin as defined in the agreement was increased by basis points from a range of to 
following the occurrence of any event of default  the bank may increase the rate by an additional two percentage points 
the amendment also increases our unused line fee from per annum to per annum 
the unused line fee is payable monthly based on the difference between the revolving credit ceiling and the average loan balance under the agreement 
the aggregate amount that we may borrow under the agreement at any time is further limited by a formula  which is based substantially on our inventory level but cannot be greater than the revolving credit ceiling of million 
the credit facility amendment reduces our borrowing base as defined in the credit facility for the periods from october to december of each year and decreases the amount of permitted acquisitions as defined in the agreement per year from  to  as additional consideration for the amendment and the extension of the maturity date of the facility  we paid  in fees 
we had balances under our credit facility of million  and million as of january  and february   respectively 
we had approximately million and million in unused borrowing capacity calculated under the provisions of our credit facility as of january  and february   respectively

amounts borrowed under the credit facility continue to be secured by substantially all of our assets 
in connection with the administration of the agreement  we are required to pay a facility fee of  per month 
if contingencies related to early termination of the revolving credit facility were to occur  or if we request and receive an accommodation from the lender in connection with the facility  we may be required to pay additional fees 
the credit facility continues to include financial  reporting and other covenants relating to  among other things  use of funds under the facility in accordance with our business plan  prohibiting a change of control  including any person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or our combined voting power as defined in the credit facility  maintaining a minimum availability  prohibiting new debt  restricting dividends and the repurchase of our stock  and restricting certain acquisitions 
in the event that we violate any of these covenants  or if other indebtedness in excess of million could be accelerated  or in the event that or more of our leases could be terminated other than solely as a result of certain sales of our common stock  the lender would have the right to accelerate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the agreement  or to commence foreclosure proceedings on our assets 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of january  and expect to remain in compliance throughout fiscal year based on the expected execution of our business plan 
during fiscal year  we began to experience low levels of unused borrowing capacity based on our borrowing base calculations 
consequently  we requested and the bank agreed on april   to adjust the borrowing base calculation to provide for additional borrowing capacity of  for the period from april  through may  this agreement was subsequently extended through june   and  effective 
table of contents june   further extended until september  as of april   we had an outstanding balance of million and approximately million of unused borrowing capacity  based on our borrowing base calculations 
subordinated secured term loan on april   subsequent to year end  we amended our million subordinated secured term loan to modify the financial covenant for minimum adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of fiscal year in order to maintain compliance with that covenant 
the amendment also tightened certain other financial covenants relating to our tangible net worth as defined in the loan agreement and minimum adjusted ebitda in future periods and reduced the allowable amount of our capital expenditures for fiscal years and to  per year 
as consideration for this amendment  we paid a fee of  and issued an additional  shares of our common stock we also amended the subordinated secured term loan in may to modify our first quarter minimum adjusted ebitda financial covenant and to defer principal payments until september   with the remaining principal payments under the loan re amortized over the original term 
we initially entered into the subordinated secured term loan with private equity management group  inc pem  as arranger and administrative agent on behalf of the lender  and an affiliate of pem  as the lender  and pursuant to a certain second lien credit agreement on february  the loan matures on february   with interest and principal installments required to be repaid over months at an interest rate of per annum 
as consideration for the initial loan and the may amendment thereto  pem received  shares of our common stock  an advisory fee of  and pem s costs and expenses 
we received aggregate gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of approximately million from the term loan 
we used the net proceeds initially to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility and for working capital purposes 
we have broad obligations to indemnify  and pay the fees and expenses of pem and the lender in connection with  among other things  the enforcement  performance and administration of the loan agreement and the other loan documents 
under the loan agreement  we continue to be permitted to prepay the loan  subject to prepayment penalties which now range between and of the aggregate principal balance of the loan 
we are also required to make prepayments  subject to our senior subordination agreement with pem and our senior lender  on the term loan in certain circumstances  including generally if we sell property and assets outside the ordinary course of business  and upon receipt of certain extraordinary cash proceeds and upon sales of securities 
the loan agreement contains financial covenants which require us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth and adjusted ebitda both as defined in the loan agreement each fiscal quarter and annual limits on capital expenditures 
the loan agreement also contains certain other restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to use the proceeds of the loan  to incur additional indebtedness  to pre pay other indebtedness  to dispose of assets  to effect certain corporate transactions  including specified mergers and sales of all or substantially all of our assets  to change the nature of our business  to pay dividends other than in the form of common stock dividends  as well as covenants that limit transactions with affiliates and prohibit a change of control 
for this purpose  a change of control is generally defined as  among other things  a person or entity acquiring beneficial ownership of more than of our common stock  specified changes to our board of directors  sale of all or substantially all of our assets or certain recapitalizations 
the loan agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants  including provisions relating to providing reports  inspections and appraisal  and maintenance of property and collateral 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the loan agreement  the lender will be entitled to acceleration of the debt plus all accrued and unpaid interest  subject to the senior subordination agreement  with the interest rate increasing to per annum 
the loan agreement generally provides for customary events of default  including default in the payment of principal or interest or other required payments  failure to observe or perform covenants or agreements contained in the transaction documents excluding the registration rights agreement  materially breaching our credit facility with our senior lender or the terms of our subordinated convertible debentures  
table of contents generally failure to pay when due debt obligations broadly defined  subject to certain exceptions in excess of million  specified events of bankruptcy or specified judgments against us 
the loan is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the loan is subordinate to our senior secured credit facility with bank of america  na  our senior lender  but it is senior to our million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures due we have granted certain registration rights to pem with respect to the initial  shares described above 
we were required to file a registration statement relating to the shares  and have that registration statement declared effective with the sec  within certain time periods 
we filed the registration statement and the sec declared the registration statement effective within the required time periods 
if we did not meet these deadlines  or if the registration statement ceases to be effective for more than days per year or more than consecutive calendar days or if our common stock ceases to be traded on an eligible market as required  then we must generally pay pem liquidated damages in an amount equal to of the value of the registrable shares remaining based on an aggregate value of  for each day period prorated for partial periods 
we are required to use our reasonable best efforts to keep the registration statement continuously effective  subject to certain exceptions  until the earlier of all of the registrable securities being sold or ceasing to be registrable under the agreement  or february  we are required to pay all costs of preparing  filing and maintaining the effectiveness of the registration statement 
we also have certain other ongoing obligations  including providing pem specified notices and certain information  indemnifying pem for certain liabilities and using reasonable best efforts to timely file all required filings with the sec and make and keep current public information about us 
we did not grant pem any registration rights with respect to the  additional shares issued in connection with the april amendment to the term loan 
based on the specified value of the  shares described above  as of january   the maximum amount of liquidated damages that we could be required to pay would have been  which represents potential monthly payments of  we filed the required registration statement on may  and the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on may  we have not recorded a liability in connection with the registration rights agreement because  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we have concluded that it is not probable that we will make any payments under the liquidated damages provisions of the registration rights agreement 
subordinated convertible debentures on june   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures the debentures to seven accredited investors in a private placement generating net proceeds of approximately million  which were used to repay amounts owed under our revolving credit facility 
the debentures are nonamortizing  bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually on each june and december  and mature on june  investors included corporate directors andrew n 
baur and scott c 
schnuck  an entity affiliated with mr 
baur  and advisory directors bernard a 
edison and julian edison 
the debentures are convertible into shares of common stock at any time 
the initial conversion price was per share 
the conversion price  and thus the number of shares into which the debentures are convertible  is subject to anti dilution and other adjustments 
if we distribute any assets other than ordinary cash dividends  then generally each holder is entitled to receive a like amount of such distributed property 
in the event of a merger  consolidation  sale of substantially all of our assets  or reclassification or compulsory share exchange  then upon any subsequent conversion each holder will have the right to either the same property as it would have otherwise been entitled or cash in an amount equal to principal amount of the debenture  plus interest and any other amounts owed 
the debentures also contain a weighted average conversion price adjustment generally for future issuances  at prices less than the then current conversion price  of common stock or securities convertible into  or options to purchase  shares of common stock  excluding generally currently outstanding options  warrants or performance shares and any future issuances or deemed issuances pursuant to any properly authorized equity compensation plans 
in accordance with rules of the nasdaq  the debentures contain limitations on the number of shares issuable pursuant to the debentures regardless of how low the conversion price may be  including limitations generally requiring that the conversion price not be less than per share for debentures issued to advisory directors  corporate directors or the entity affiliated with mr 
baur  that we do not issue common stock amounting to more than 
table of contents of our common stock in the transaction or such that following conversion  the total number of shares beneficially owned by each holder does not exceed of our common stock 
these limitations may be removed with shareholder approval 
as a result of the issuance of  shares of common stock in connection with our subordinated secured term loan  the conversion price of the debentures decreased from to  making the debentures convertible into  shares of our common stock 
the debentures generally provide for customary events of default  which could result in acceleration of all amounts owed  including default in required payments  failure to pay when due  or the acceleration of  other monetary obligations for indebtedness broadly defined in excess of million subject to certain exceptions  failure to observe or perform covenants or agreements contained in the transaction documents  including covenants relating to using the net proceeds  maintaining legal existence  prohibiting the sale of material assets outside of the ordinary course  prohibiting cash dividends and distributions  share repurchases  and certain payments to our officers and directors 
we generally have the right  but not the obligation  to redeem the unpaid principal balance of the debentures at any time prior to conversion if the closing price of our common stock as adjusted for stock dividends  subdivisions or combinations is equal to or above per share for each of consecutive trading days and certain other conditions are met 
we have also agreed to provide certain piggyback and demand registration rights  until two years after the debentures cease to be outstanding  to the holders under the securities act of relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures 
private placement of common stock and warrants in connection with our private placement of common stock and warrants  we sold warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  subject to anti dilution and other adjustments 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and  subject to certain conditions  expire on april  we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of through april  to the placement agent 
in certain circumstances  a cashless exercise provision becomes operative for the warrants issued to the investors 
in the event that the closing bid price of a share of our stock equals or exceeds per share for consecutive trading days  we have the ability to call the warrants  effectively forcing their exercise into common stock 
the warrants issued to the placement agent generally have the same terms and conditions  except that the cashless exercise provision is more generally available and the warrants are not subject to a call provision 
through january   warrants underlying  shares of common stock had been exercised  generating net proceeds to us of  in connection with our private placement  we entered into a registration rights agreement wherein we agreed to make the requisite sec filings to achieve and subsequently maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the common stock sold and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the investor warrants and the placement agent warrants issued in connection with the private placement generally through april  and agreed to pay liquidated damages in certain circumstances 
our potential liability for liquidated damages with respect to this registration statement ended on april  we estimated the grant date fair value of the  stock purchase warrants  including the placement agent warrants  issued in connection with the private placement to be  using the black scholes formula assuming no dividends  a risk free interest rate of  expected volatility of  and expected warrant life of five years 
because the warrants were issued in connection with the sale of common stock and we have no obligation to settle the warrants by any means other than through the issuance of shares of our common stock we have included the fair value of the warrants as a component of shareholders equity 
ipo warrants in connection with our initial public offering  we sold to the representatives of the underwriters and their designees five year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to per share 
through january   warrants underlying  shares of common stock were tendered in cashless exercise transactions under which we issued  shares of common stock 
on february   all unexercised warrants expired 

table of contents a majority of the warrant holders held demand registration rights until february  in addition  we are required to include the shares of common stock underlying the warrants in any appropriate registration statement we file during the six years following the consummation of our initial public offering 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  payments due in period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total includes principal and interest payments on our subordinated secured term loan and our subordinated convertible debentures 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  these obligations are classified as current liabilities on our balance sheet at january  includes minimum payment obligations relating to our store leases 
includes merchandise on order and payment obligations relating to store construction and miscellaneous service contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements at january  and february   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could otherwise have arisen if we had engaged in such relationships
