item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the principal factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the years described 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and risk factors for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these forward looking statements and risk factors 
the operating results for the years presented were not significantly affected by inflation 
company overview we are a developer  manufacturer and marketer of technologically advanced blood glucose monitoring systems and disposable supplies for diabetics worldwide 
we market our blood glucose monitoring systems both under our own hdi brands and through a unique co branding strategy in partnership with the leading food and drug retailers  mass merchandisers  distributors  mail service providers and third party payors in the united states and internationally 
our co branding distribution strategy allows our customers to leverage their brand strategy with ours and to deliver high quality  low cost blood glucose monitoring systems to their diabetic customers at attractive price points for the consumer and increased profit margins for the retailer or distributor 
our company was founded in and has focused exclusively on the diabetes market since inception 
we have two manufacturing facilities  one located in fort lauderdale  florida  and the other in hsinchu city  taiwan 
we manufacture  test and package our blood glucose test strips at our facility in fort lauderdale 
our blood glucose monitors are assembled in our taiwan facility 
labeling  final assembly  quality control testing and shipment of our blood glucose monitoring systems are conducted in our fort lauderdale facility 
we sell our products in the following distribution channels retail the retail channel generates the majority of sales of blood glucose monitoring products in the united states and includes chain drug stores  food stores and mass merchandisers 
we sell our products into the retail channel on a direct basis or through domestic distributors 
our retail net sales include products we sell directly into the retail channel for the larger food and drug retailers 
domestic distribution the domestic distribution channel includes sales to domestic wholesalers  including amerisourcebergen  cardinal health  mckesson  and invacare  who sell products to independent and chain food and drug retailers  primary and long term care providers  durable medical equipment suppliers and mail service providers 
mail service the mail service channel includes sales to leading mail service providers  who market their products primarily to the medicare population 
international the international channel consists of sales on a direct basis in the united kingdom and canada and through distributors primarily in latin america  germany  australia  and china 
our net sales by channel were as follows for the years indicated years ended december  in thousands retail domestic distribution mail service international certain and sales have been reclassified to confirm to current year presentation 
table of contents we enter into agreements with certain of our customers from time to time addressing terms of sale  volume discounts  minimum requirements for maintaining exclusivity and the like 
however  we do not rely on written agreements to any significant extent  but rather on our relationships with our customers 
most of our sales are made pursuant to purchase orders  and we do not have any agreements that require customers to purchase any minimum amount of our products 
our gross margins over the past three years have been in the range of to 
we strive to maximize our installed base of monitors to drive future sales of our test strips 
monitors  which are sold individually or in a starter kit with a sample of test strips and other supplies  are typically sold at or below cost 
it is also common for us to provide monitors free of charge in support of managed care initiatives and other market opportunities 
test strip sales are a significant driver of our overall gross margins 
we measure our operating performance in many ways  including the ratio of test strips to monitors sold in a given period 
our gross margins are affected by several factors  including manufacturing costs  the ratio of test strips to monitors  free monitor distributions and product pricing 
our gross margins can be negatively impacted by new product introductions as we invest to build an installed base of users for our systems 
this is due to several factors  including free or discounted monitors  lower ratio of test strip to monitor sales and cost inefficiencies during scale up of manufacturing 
we expect the recent launch of our new no code meter systems to continue to have a negative impact on our gross margins in as we continue to build an installed base of users 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include sales and marketing expenses  legal and regulatory costs  customer and technical service  finance and administrative expenses and stock based compensation expenses 
we have been involved in patent related litigation concerning certain of our products 
our legal costs excluding litigation settlements  which were  and of net sales in  and  respectively  can be significant  and the timing difficult to predict 
our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased for costs associated with being a publicly traded company  including accounting and auditing  legal  insurance  director compensation  sarbanes oxley compliance and other costs 
in addition  our sg a has increased due to marketing cost associated with the launch of new products 
we have made significant investments in our research and development initiatives 
our research and development costs have generally been in the range of to of our net sales and include salaries and related costs for our scientists and staff as well as costs for clinical studies  materials  consulting and other third party services 
our research and development team is working to develop new technologies that we believe will broaden our product portfolio and enhance our current products

see liquidity and capital resources below 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for year ended december  was lower than the statutory federal rate  primarily due to the reversal of previously accrued taxes resulting from the favorable resolution of various tax matters with the internal revenue service and the reversal of certain tax contingencies for which the statute of limitations expired in  which contributed to of the decrease  and the research and development tax credit  which contributed to of the decrease

the increased volume of million reflects the continued trend of increased distribution of our biosensor systems totaling approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in our photometric system and other sales of approximately million 
the decrease in our average selling prices of million was primarily due to a shift in our revenue mix driven by increased international and mail service volume and shifts in customer and product mix within our domestic distribution channel 
the increase in managed care rebates was due primarily to increased awareness and acceptance within the third party payor environment of our products

see liquidity and capital resources below 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate was primarily due to disqualifying dispositions on incentive stock options 
the effective tax rate for year ended december  was lower than the statutory federal rate  primarily as a result of research and development tax credits 
net income decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the decrease in net income for the year ended december  was due primarily to increased selling general and administrative expenses  partially offset by higher gross profit  interest income and the reduction in the effective tax rate  noted above 
litigation settlements  net reduced net income by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
diluted net income per common share was on weighted average shares of million for the year ended december   as compared to on weighted average shares of million in liquidity and capital resources on december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and million of capacity under our unsecured revolving line of credit 
our primary capital requirements are to fund capital expenditures and fund common stock repurchases under our board of directors approved common stock repurchase program  as described below 
significant sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash flows from operating activities  working capital and borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
under our fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement the credit facility  we have a million unsecured revolving line of credit the revolver which matures on april  at december   there was no outstanding balance under the revolver 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offered rate or libor plus 
our credit facility contains a financial covenant and other covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things  incur liens  repurchase greater than million of our common stock any calendar year and participate in a change in control 
our financial covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of not more than to failure to comply with this covenant and other restrictions would constitute an event of default under our credit facility 
we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenant and other restrictions applicable to us under the credit facility at december  in  the company completed two board of directors approved common stock repurchase programs the common stock repurchase program by repurchasing approximately million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million  since august during the year ended december   the company repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately million 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately million 
all purchases under the common stock repurchase program were made in the open market  subject to market conditions and trading restrictions 
in december  the company s board of directors authorized the company under a new repurchase program to purchase million of its common stock 
purchases under this program began in january as of march   the company repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 

table of contents cash flows provided by operating activities were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was due to the continued investment in inventory associated with the launch of our new trueresult and truego biosensor systems 
cash flows used in investing activities were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts consist primarily of capital expenditures including manufacturing equipment for our new truetest strip platform which was launched in september  deposits related to our expansion described below and additional manufacturing equipment used on our existing biosensor test strip manufacturing line 
in order to meet the expected long term demand for our new truetest platform  our board of directors  in august approved a plan to expand capacity 
the expansion is expected to cost approximately million to million for custom manufacturing equipment and facility improvements  of which million was spent in we have open purchase commitments totaling approximately million for this expansion 
we believe this new equipment will be fully operational in early we expect our full year capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million  including approximately million related to the expansion 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows used in financing activities in include million used to repurchase shares of our common stock under our million common stock repurchase program  offset by proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options 
cash flows used in financing activities in include million used to repurchase shares of our common stock under our common stock repurchase program  offset by proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options 
cash flows provided by financing activities in include ipo proceeds of million  offset by payments to redeem our preferred stock of million and debt repayments of million 
at december  and  there was no outstanding balance under the revolver 
on september   we completed an ipo of  shares of common stock at a price of per share   of which were sold by us and the remainder by selling stockholders 
we received net proceeds after underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately million 
we used million of the net proceeds of the offering to redeem all the series f preferred stock outstanding  million to repay outstanding indebtedness and million for manufacturing equipment for new product development 
the redemption of the preferred stock resulted in a dividend charge to stockholders equity of million 
in addition  the holder of a warrant to purchase our common stock exercised its registration rights and exchanged the warrant for  shares of common stock 
these shares were sold at per share in connection with the ipo for a total of million which is reflected in stockholders equity at december  on october   the underwriters on our ipo  exercised their over allotment option to purchase  additional shares of common stock from certain selling stockholders at the public offering price of per share 
we did not issue any new shares of common stock or receive any proceeds from the sale of the over allotment shares 
we expect that funds generated from operations  our current cash on hand and funds available under our revolving line of credit  which expires in april and is expected to be renewed at maturity  will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures  and meet our contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents contractual obligations at december   we had the following contractual obligations and commitments payments due less than obligation total year years years thereafter in thousands operating leases purchase obligations future pension benefit payments amounts exclude certain income tax contingencies of approximately million for which the timing of payments is not determinable 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  sales or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies  which are all in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  because their application requires management to make assumptions about future results and depends to a large extent on management s judgment  because past results have fluctuated and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
we believe that the application of the accounting policies described in the following paragraphs is highly dependent on critical estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and highly susceptible to change 
for all these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those discussed below 
revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
we generally arrange for the shipment of customer orders and it is our general business practice to replace products that may be damaged or lost while in transit at no additional cost to the customer 
therefore  revenue is generally recognized when goods are received by our customers 
we accept product returns primarily due to the expiration of product life 
revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns 
we estimate returns based on an analysis of historical sales and returns  analyzing the actual return date of the product as compared to the original date of sale of the product 
we have estimated based on historical return experience that a reserve is required for future returns covering the prior to months of sales  driven primarily by the to month expiration of our test strip products 
products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating or other matters are specifically identified and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals 
we offer volume discount incentives to certain of our customers  which are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned 
we also have reimbursement agreements with certain 
table of contents managed care providers  medicaid programs and other third party payors that require payment of rebates for products provided to their members 
we accrue for these rebates as a reduction of revenue  at the time of sale 
the determination of the rebate allowance is based on the reimbursement agreements as well as historical payment trends to these providers 
we also offer meters  at no charge  to customers and third party payors 
the cost of these meters is recorded in cost of sales in the period the products are shipped 
we arrange with certain of our customers upfront cash payments to secure the right to distribute through those customers 
we capitalize these payments  provided the payments are supported by a time or volume based arrangement with a retailer  and amortize the associated payment over the appropriate time or volume based term of the arrangement 
long lived and other intangible assets 
we periodically review our property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived and other intangible assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
significant assumptions and estimates include the projected cash flows based upon estimated revenue and expense growth rates and the discount rate applied to expected cash flows 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired net of liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
we periodically evaluate acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our business 
we carry out an annual impairment review of goodwill unless an event occurs which triggers the need for an earlier review 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our business is impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
in determining the fair value  we utilize discounted future cash flows 
significant estimates used in the fair value calculation utilizing discounted future cash flows include  but are not limited to i estimates of future revenue and expense growth  ii estimated average cost of capital  and iii the future terminal value of our reporting unit  which is based upon its ability to exist into perpetuity 
the test for goodwill impairment requires significant estimates and judgment about future performance  cash flows and fair value 
our future results could be affected if our estimates of future performance and fair value change 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we completed our annual test during the quarter ended december  and no impairment charge resulted 
contingencies 
we accrue for estimated losses from legal actions or claims when events exist that make the realization of the losses probable and the losses can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation claims based on currently available information to assess potential liability 
we develop our estimates of litigation costs in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
these estimates involve significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances of each case 
our future results could be affected if our estimated loss accruals  if any  are below the actual costs incurred 
any resulting loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
as disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  we settled in  litigation involving alleged patent infringement and other matters 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  in the first quarter of this statement requires us to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options 
this statement also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements with respect to these equity arrangements 
under the provisions of sfas r  we have estimated the fair value of new stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions for expected volatility  expected 
table of contents life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
significant changes in these assumptions could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
in accordance with sfas r  we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity based awards based on grant date fair value 
pre vesting forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant are periodically revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
equity based compensation is only recognized for equity based awards expected to vest 
income taxes 
we recognize our provision for income taxes at the applicable us or international tax rates 
deferred income taxes are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are also established for the future tax benefits of loss and credit carryovers 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that such amounts will not be realized 
us income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since it is management s intention to utilize those earnings in the foreign operations for an indefinite period of time 
we account for income tax uncertainties under fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which provides guidance on the recognition  de recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million 
it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by an immaterial amount within the next twelve months resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations of certain tax years 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas r s scope is broader than that of sfas  which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration 
sfas r applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
the standard requires the fair value of the purchase price  including the issuance of equity securities  to be determined on the acquisition date 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interests in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in the statement 
sfas r requires acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred and restructuring costs to be expensed in periods after the acquisition date 
earn outs and other forms of contingent consideration are to be recorded at fair value on the acquisition date 
changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period will be recognized in earnings rather than as an adjustment to the cost of the acquisition 
sfas r generally applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  with early adoption prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material effect on our future results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas requires non controlling interests or minority interests to be treated as a separate component of equity  not as a liability or other item outside of permanent equity 
upon a loss of control  the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  is required to be measured at fair value  with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
based on sfas  assets and liabilities will not change for subsequent purchase or sale transactions with non controlling interests as long as control is maintained 
differences between the fair value of consideration paid or received and the carrying value of non controlling interests are to be recognized as an adjustment to the parent interest s equity 
sfas is effective 
table of contents for fiscal year beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our future results of operations or financial position 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 
sfas 
sfas seeks to improve financial reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures regarding the impact on financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
to achieve this increased transparency  sfas requires the disclosure of the fair value of derivative instruments and gains and losses in a tabular format  the disclosure of derivative features that are credit risk related  and cross referencing within the footnotes 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our future results of operations or financial position 
in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp fas 
this fsp clarifies the definition of fair value by stating that a transaction price is not necessarily indicative of fair value in a market that is not active or in a forced liquidation or distressed sale 
the guidance in fsp fas was effective immediately upon issuance on oct 
  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
our fair value measurements are based upon level and level observable inputs and therefore the adoption of fsp fas did not impact our results of operations or financial position 
seasonality our quarterly sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonal variations in demand 
historically  sales are highest during the third quarter as a result of trade shows held by large domestic distributors 
first quarter sales are typically the lowest due to the start of new deductible periods under health plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our credit facility is subject to market risk and interest rate changes 
the revolver under the credit facility bears interest at libor plus 
at december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our revolver 
certain of our operations are domiciled outside the us  and we translate the results of operations and financial condition of these operations from their local functional currencies into us dollars 
therefore  our reported consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition are affected by changes in the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar 
assets and liabilities of foreign operations have been translated from the functional currencies of our foreign operations into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the relevant balance sheet date  and revenue and expenses of our foreign operations have been translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
unrealized gains and losses on translation of these foreign operations into us dollars are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in comprehensive income loss 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars held by our foreign operations are re measured from us dollars into the functional currency of our foreign operations with the effect reported currently as a component of net income 
for the years ended december  and  we estimate that a increase or decrease in the relationship of the functional currencies of our foreign operations to the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by approximately million respectively 
in april  the company entered into a non deliverable forward ndf contract for a notional amount of million to reduce exposure of foreign currency fluctuations on transactions with it s foreign subsidiary in taiwan 
the ndf contract matures in february at december   the fair value of the ndf is estimated to be a liability of approximately million 
fair value of the ndf is estimated based on observable inputs for the current ndf forward rates for similar contracts 
we estimate that a increase or decrease in the ndf forward would increase or decrease our net income by approximately million  offsetting the impact of foreign currency market risk described above
