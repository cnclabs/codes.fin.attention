item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ducommun incorporated ducommun or the company  through its subsidiaries designs  engineers and manufactures aerostructure and electromechanical components and subassemblies  and provides engineering  technical and program management services principally for the aerospace industry 
these components  assemblies and services are provided principally for domestic and foreign commercial and military aircraft  helicopter  missile and related programs as well as space programs 
domestic commercial aircraft programs include the boeing ng    and foreign commercial aircraft programs include the airbus industrie a and a aircraft  bombardier business and regional jets  and the embraer and major military programs include the boeing c  f and f and lockheed martin f and f aircraft  and various aircraft and shipboard electronics upgrade programs 
commercial and military helicopter programs include helicopters manufactured by boeing principally the apache and chinook helicopters  sikorsky  bell  augusta and carson 
the company also supports various unmanned space launch vehicle and satellite programs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a non cash charge of  at dti relating to its miltec reporting unit for the impairment of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performed its required annual impairment test for goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis supported by comparative market multiples to determine the fair values of its businesses versus their book values 
the test as of december  indicated the book value of miltec exceeded the fair value of the business 
the impairment charge driven by adverse equity market conditions that caused a decrease in current market multiples and the company s stock price as of december  compared with the test performed as of december  the charge reduced goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of miltec and does not impact the company s normal business operations 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc  and terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider risk profiles associated with growth projection risks 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of discounted cash flow model 
due to many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of the company s recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis 
prior to recording the goodwill impairment charge at miltec  the company tested the purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets at the business as required by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and the carrying value of these assets were determined not to be impaired 
the fourth quarter of was also negatively impacted by the strike of boeing by the international association of machinists and aerospace workers and by an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts due to a customer s bankruptcy

engineering  technical and program management services are provided principally for advanced weapons systems and missile defense 
sales  gross profit as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales  the effective tax rate and the diluted earnings per share in and  respectively  were as follows net sales in s gross profit of sales sg a expense of sales effective tax rate diluted earnings per share the company manufactures components and assemblies principally for domestic and foreign commercial and military aircraft  helicopter and space programs 
the company s miltec subsidiary provides engineering  technical and program management services almost entirely for united states defense  space and homeland security programs 
the company s mix of military  commercial and space business in  and  respectively  was approximately as follows military commercial space total the company is dependent on boeing commercial aircraft  the c aircraft and the apache helicopter programs 
sales to these programs  as a percentage of total sales  for  and  respectively  were approximately as follows boeing commercial aircraft boeing c aircraft boeing apache helicopter all others total net income for was lower than the decline in net income in was driven by non cash goodwill impairment at ducommun technologies  inc dti  relating to its miltec reporting unit of  and an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts  at ducommun aerostructures  inc das due to a customer s bankruptcy 
net income was also affected by lower operating performance at dti operating segment and a higher effective tax rate in  partially offset by an improvement in operating performance at das and a decrease in interest expense due to lower debt and lower interest rates in critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered 
revenue from products sold under long term contracts is recognized by the company on the same basis as other sale transactions 
the company recognizes revenue on the sale of services including prototype products based on the type of contract time and materials  cost plus reimbursement and firm fixed price 
revenue is recognized i on time and materials contracts as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with customers  plus the cost of any allowable materials and out of pocket expenses  ii on cost plus reimbursement contracts based on direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of cost  a fixed amount or a performance based award fee  and iii on fixed price service contracts on the percentage of completion method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to estimated total costs 
provision for estimated losses on contracts the company records provisions for estimated losses on contracts in the period in which such losses are identified 
the provisions for estimated losses on contracts require management to make certain estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to the future revenue under a contract and the future cost to complete the contract 
management s estimate of the future cost to complete a contract may include assumptions as to improvements in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating and material costs 
if any of these or other assumptions and estimates do not materialize in the future  the company may be required to record additional provisions for estimated losses on contracts 
goodwill the company s business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  comparable company analyses  discount rates and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if actual results do not meet these estimates  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if adverse equity market conditions cause a decrease in current market multiples and the company s stock price the company may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets 
in the event that a goodwill impairment charge is required  it could adversely affect the operating results and financial position of the company 
other intangible assets the company amortizes purchased other intangible assets with finite lives using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  ranging from one to fourteen years 
the value of other intangibles acquired through business combinations has been estimated using present value techniques which involve estimates of future cash flows 
actual results could vary  potentially resulting in impairment charges 
accounting for stock based compensation the company uses a black scholes valuation model in determining the stock based compensation expense for options  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
the company has two award populations  one with an option vesting term of four years and the other with an option vesting term of one year 
the company estimated the forfeiture rate based on its historic experience 
for performance and restricted stock units the company calculates compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service performance period of the awards 
the performance stock units vest based on a three year cumulative performance cycle 
the company has two restricted stock units  one restricted stock unit vests at the end of five years and the other restricted stock unit vests equally over a three year period ending in the company estimated the forfeiture rate based on its historic experience 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventoried costs include raw materials  outside processing  direct labor and allocated overhead  adjusted for any abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage incurred  but do not include any selling  general and administrative expense 
costs under long term contracts are accumulated into  and removed from  inventory on the same basis as other contracts 
the company assesses the inventory carrying value and reduces it  if necessary  to its net realizable value based on customer orders on hand  and internal demand forecasts using management s best estimates given information currently available 
the company s customer demand can fluctuate significantly caused by factors beyond the control of the company 
the company maintains an allowance for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that are carried at costs that are higher than their estimated net realizable values 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in demand and not meeting expectations  inventory write downs may be required

the majority of guarantees and indemnities do not provide any limitations of the maximum potential future payments the company could be obligated to make 
historically  payments related to these guarantees and indemnities have been immaterial 
the company estimates the fair value of its indemnification obligations as insignificant based on this history and insurance coverage and has  therefore  not recorded any liability for these guarantees and indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will not have any future financial exposure under these indemnification obligations

the boeing company and ducommun inc  filed in the united states district court for the district of kansas 
the lawsuit is qui tam action brought against the boeing company boeing and ducommun on behalf of the united states of america for violations of the united states false claims act 
the lawsuit alleges that ducommun sold unapproved parts to the boeing commercial airplanes wichita division which were installed by boeing in aircraft ultimately sold to the united states government 
the lawsuit seeks damages  civil penalties and other relief from the defendants for presenting or causing to be presented false claims for payment to the united states government 
although the amount of alleged damages are not specified  the lawsuit seeks damages in an amount equal to three times the amount of damages the united states government sustained because of the defendants actions  plus a civil penalty of  for each false claim made on or before september   and  for each false claim made on or after september   together with attorneys fees and costs 
the company intends to defend itself vigorously against the lawsuit 
the company  at this time  is unable to estimate what  if any  liability it may have in connection with the lawsuit 
das has been directed by california environmental agencies to investigate and take corrective action for ground water contamination at its facilities located in el mirage and monrovia  california 
based on currently available information  the company has established a reserve for its estimated liability for such investigation and corrective action in the approximate amount of  das also faces liability as a potentially responsible party for hazardous waste disposed at two landfills located in casmalia and west covina  california 
das and other companies and government entities have entered into consent decrees with respect to each landfill with the united states environmental protection agency and or california environmental agencies under which certain investigation  remediation and maintenance activities are being performed 
based upon currently available information  the company has established a reserve for its estimated liability in connection with the landfills in the approximate amount of  the company s ultimate liability in connection with these matters will depend upon a number of factors  including changes in existing laws and regulations  the design and cost of construction  operation and maintenance activities  and the allocation of liability among potentially responsible parties 
in the normal course of business  ducommun and its subsidiaries are defendants in certain other litigation  claims and inquiries  including matters relating to environmental laws 
in addition  the company makes various commitments and incurs contingent liabilities 
while it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters  the company does not presently expect that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with these matters would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

recent accounting pronouncements on september   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as a result of sfas no 
there is now a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap 
the fasb believes that the new standard will make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable and improve disclosures about those measures 
the effective date of sfas no 
was delayed for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
certain provisions of sfas no 
were effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of the adoption of sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities in the did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company is currently evaluating the remaining requirements of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  on its results of operations and financial position 
as of november   we adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which requires that the consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the pension ad postretirement plans 
the funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation 
we have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in prepaid pension assets and the aggregate of all unfunded plans in either postretirement medical and life benefits or accrued pension benefits 
at november   previously unrecognized actuarial gains losses and the prior services credits costs are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in consolidated balance sheet as required by sfas in future periods  the additional actuarial gains losses and prior services credits costs will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the period in which they occur 
in february  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
 which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the provisions of sfas no 
were effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows as the company has elected not to apply the fair value option 
in december  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revised  business combinations sfas no
