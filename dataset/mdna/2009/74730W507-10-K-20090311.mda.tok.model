financial statement overview the company completed its acquisition of the cpr business in late september  an event which makes the comparability of the  and financial results presented in this annual report on form k difficult 
although fiscal year reflects an entire year of revenue from this product line and customer base  and additional headcount related costs within our cost of services and software development expense categories  fiscal year reflects these items only during the three months ended december  and fiscal year reflects no such revenues or expenses 
during february  we began a strategic initiative to increase overall product development capacity through a partnering arrangement with tata consultancy services tcs 
concurrent with this partnering arrangement  we reduced our overall workforce by employees  primarily in the service and software development areas  and incurred severance costs of million in these efforts are expected to result in more efficient operations over the long term 
on april   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries  quadramed international pty limited in australia and quadramed international limited in the united kingdom  for initial cash proceeds of million and future earn out payments over a three year period based on a schedule of targeted revenue between  aud and  aud per year 
in connection with this sale  we recorded a loss on sale of these assets of million and severance expense of million  which are reflected primarily in costs of services in our second quarter of the products contained within these subsidiaries focused on stand alone lab and radiology products installed in the united kingdom  australia and new zealand 
however  with the addition of the quadramed cpr qcpr product last year  which includes integrated lab and radiology  and our focus on the care based revenue cycle and core products  these foreign based products were considered redundant to our portfolio 
on june   quadramed corporation announced the effectiveness of the reverse split 
on june  we received approval to list our common stock  par value  on the nasdaq global market under the new trading symbol qdhc 
we delisted our common stock from the american stock exchange on july  and our common stock began trading on the nasdaq global market on july  on july   the saudi arabia national guard health affairs  located in riyadh  saudi arabia  signed a contract for qcpr service expansion  migration to intersystem s cache database and interface licenses that represent sales bookings of approximately million  with a total contract value of approximately million 
the revenue will be recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the contract service period  which is anticipated to be two years 
on july   we announced the general availability of qcpr cache sql  which provides hospitals with a fully integrated electronic health record operating on an enterprise platform built upon the intersystems cache  a high performance  post relational sql database 

table of contents on august   daughters of charity health system of los altos hills  california signed a million contract for the phase ii and phase iii options of a master agreement that was originally finalized on november   prior to quadramed s acquisition of the cpr business 
phase ii and phase iii include the purchase of software and services for the qcpr platform including interactive care grid  order management  access management  clinical decision support  nursing documentation  chart management and additional software for scheduling  electronic document management  medical records  computerized physician order entry and patient registration  all for their five facility network of hospitals 
the phase i option  which was ordered at the same time as the execution of the master agreement  included the purchase of software  services and hardware for an integrated medication management system  and was valued at million 
in addition  we recognized million of revenue during related to contracts that had been completed in prior periods 
some of these contracts  for which approximately million of such recognized revenue  had residual unbilled receivables and or deferred revenue balances creating out of balance conditions in the contract subledger records 
these contracts were closed out in september resulting in additional license revenue of million  services revenue of million and maintenance revenue of million 
all costs related to these revenues had been recognized in prior periods when incurred 
sales bookings for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase over the million recorded for fiscal year net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease between periods was primarily a result of a million increase in income from operations and a million decrease due to an increase in our provision for income taxes 
we only began recognizing deferred income tax expense during the fourth quarter of because  at that time  we determined that a valuation allowance on most of our deferred tax assets was no longer required 
in  we had an income tax benefit of million  primarily associated with the reduction in our valuation allowance 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  which reflects our effective income tax rate of during after we began recognizing deferred income tax expense 
income from operations before income taxes for the year was million  compared to million in the major contributors to this year over year increase were an increase of million in gross margin  offset in part by a million increase in operating costs primarily associated with additional personnel and operating costs from the cpr business that were not incurred during the full year of in addition  interest income decreased by million in as a result of lower cash and short term investment balances subsequent to the cpr business acquisition in net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was million  or per basic share and per diluted share  compared to income of million  or per basic share and per diluted share 
net income attributable to common shareholders includes preferred stock dividends and accretion of million and million in and  respectively 
as of december   we had million in cash and investments  compared to million as of december  the million increase in cash and investments  which occurred despite the million that we used to repurchase common stock during the year  was primarily a result of the receipt of the full contract payment from our government customer rather than monthly payments as experienced in previous years and the timing of cash collections from other customers and the payment of operating expenses 
during  we received approximately million for initial contract payments from significant new customer contracts and the collection of approximately million of accounts receivable related to the acquisition of the cpr business 
our days sales outstanding dso was at december  compared to at december  according to the american hospital association  there are approximately  hospitals in the united states 
although the health information management systems society himss reported that these hospitals were expected to spend billion on software and related services in  representing a increase over  recent global economic events are negatively impacting healthcare organizations 
healthcare is usually 
table of contents thought of as nearly recession proof  however  the industry is increasingly showing signs of strain 
employers are cutting jobs raising the specter of more uninsured patients and increased un reimbursed charity care 
hospitals are experiencing declining patient volumes as consumers delay elective procedures activities that are often high margin events for hospitals 
also  hospitals have had traditionally very narrow operating margins and have relied upon income from their investments to help fund operations and capital projects 
without this investment income many hospitals are trimming operating budgets and capital projects 
moreover  the february collapse of the auction market for tax exempt bonds sent interest rates much higher for not for profit healthcare borrowers  triggering costly debt restructuring across the sector 
according to a recent survey by the american hospital association  out of hospitals are finding it more difficult or even impossible to access tax exempt bonds 
nearly half of respondents have reportedly placed capital budgets on hold and indicated that they have halted some it projects 
while it is too soon to know the full impact of these developments on our business  systematic obstacles to hospitals being able to access credit for capital projects and or a lack of funds for capital projects across the healthcare market creates a headwind of uncertainty in the near term for us 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies have a considerable impact on management s discussion and analysis 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant estimates and assumptions have been made regarding revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation input assumptions  the purchase price allocation related to the cpr business acquisition  the provision for income taxes  contingencies  litigation  intangibles resulting from our purchase business combinations  assumptions used in evaluating potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets  charges associated with exit activities and other amounts 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
uncertainties are inherent in all of these estimates including the estimates underlying percentage of completion accounting method of revenue recognition 
in addition  we annually review and test our estimates related to the valuations of intangibles including acquired technology  goodwill  customer lists  trademarks and other intangibles and capitalized software 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates  particularly if different assumptions were used to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 
revenue recognition our revenue is principally generated from three sources i licensing arrangements  ii services and iii hardware 
the company s license revenue consists of fees for licenses of proprietary and third party software 
cost of license revenue primarily includes the costs of third party software  royalties and amortization of acquired technology and capitalized software 
the company s services revenue consists of maintenance  software installation  customer training and consulting services related to our license revenue  fees for providing management services  specialized staffing  and analytical services 
cost of services consists primarily of salaries  benefits and allocated costs related to providing such services 
hardware revenue includes third party hardware used by our customers in connection with purchased software 
cost of hardware revenue consists of third party equipment and installation 
quadramed licenses its products through its direct sales force 
the company s license agreements for such products do not provide for a right of return  and historically  product returns have not been significant 

table of contents we recognize revenue on our software products in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  we no longer have significant obligations with regard to implementation  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier 
the company considers all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond days to be neither fixed nor determinable 
revenue for arrangements with extended payment terms is recognized when the payments become due  provided all other recognition criteria are satisfied 
the company typically defers revenue and recognizes revenue on a cash basis for renewals of a term license and related support if the company s initial assessment is modified by facts and circumstances and collection is no longer deemed probable 
revenue may also be deferred and recognized on a cash basis if there is a contractual dispute and payments are delayed 
revenue is recognized when the collection becomes reasonably assured and or the contract dispute is resolved 
we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
specifically  we determine the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the substantive renewal rate approach a renewal rate specified in a contractual arrangement is representative of vender specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on hourly rates that we charge for these services when sold separately from software 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the proportion of revenue recognized upon delivery varies from quarter to quarter depending upon the mix of licensing arrangements  perpetual or term based  and the determination of vsoe for undelivered elements 
many of our licensing arrangements include fixed implementation fees and do not allow us to recognize license revenue until these services have been performed 
we recognize revenue only after establishing that we have vsoe for all undelivered elements 
some of the licenses are term or time based licenses 
we recognize revenue from these contracts ratably over the term of the arrangement 
post contract customer support pcs for all of the license term is bundled together with the term license and is included in license revenue on our consolidated financial statements 
contract accounting is applied where services include significant software modification  installation or customization 
in such instances  the services and license fee is accounted for in accordance with sop  whereby the revenue is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input hours 
we use the completed contract method of revenue recognition rather than the percentage of completion method for contracts with short implementation service periods typically less than months and in circumstances in which the company s financial position and results of operations would not vary materially from those resulting from the use of the percentage of completion method 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgment related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting can affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in its consolidated financial statements 
the company classifies revenues from these arrangements as license  installation  hardware  and services revenue based on the estimated fair value of each element using the residual method  and revenues are reflected in respective revenue categories in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents service revenues from software maintenance and support are recognized ratably over the maintenance term  which in most cases is one year 
service revenues from training  consulting and other service elements are typically recognized as the services are performed 
hardware revenue is generated primarily from transactions in which customers purchased bundled solutions that include the company s software and third party hardware 
if the bundled solution includes services that provide significant modification  installation or customization  contract accounting is applied in accordance with sop  whereby the revenue is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input hours 
otherwise  hardware revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from deferred maintenance  software installation  consulting and training services not yet rendered  license revenue is deferred until all revenue requirements have been met or as services are performed 
additionally  there are term based licenses for which revenues are recognized over the term of the contract  which is generally one year 
unbilled receivables are established when revenue is deemed to be recognized based on our revenue recognition policy  however the company does not have the right to bill the customer per the contract terms 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due us from our customers for the delivery of products and services 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects our estimate of non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and other specifically identified risks 
goodwill and intangible assets we record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the determination of fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is determined based upon a third party valuation and evaluation of other information 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives  which is performed annually  as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred 
the first step tests are for determining impairment  while the second step  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we elected to perform our annual analysis at year end and no indicators of impairment have been identified based on our assumptions used in our annual analysis 
had different assumptions been used an indicator of impairment could have been identified 
intangible assets subject to amortization include trademarks  customer marketing and technology related assets 
such intangible assets are amortized based on the estimated economic benefit over their estimated useful lives  which are generally two to ten years 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate 
sfas no 
requires that the net deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
this process requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact 
we record valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if we determine it is more likely than 
table of contents not that the asset will not be realized 
additionally  we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions based upon our judgment regarding potential future challenges to those positions 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law  significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate  our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year s liability by taxing authorities 
these changes could have a significant impact on our financial position 
the accounting estimate related to the tax valuation allowance requires us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
these assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
the impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material

recent accounting standards in september  eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements  eitf was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  eitf requires that  for split dollar life insurance arrangements that provide a benefit to an employee that extends to postretirement periods  an employer should recognize a liability for future benefits in accordance with sfas no 
eitf requires that recognition of the effects of adoption should be either by a a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or b a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods

 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no

therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
were effective on january  in february  the fasb issued a fasb staff position to partially delay the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  until fiscal years beginning after november  based on the fasb staff position  the partial adoption of sfas no

total revenue 
total revenue for was million  an increase of million  or  over total revenue of million in the year over year change was comprised of an million increase in maintenance revenue  a million increase in license revenue  a million increase in services revenue  and a million increase in installation and other revenue  all partially offset by a million decrease in hardware 
table of contents revenue 
the increase between periods was primarily due to the acquisition of the cpr business during september services and other revenue 
services and other revenue consists of professional services  such as implementation and installation services  training  maintenance which consists of technical support and product upgrades  reimbursable expenses and other services revenue 
professional services are typically provided over a period of three to nine months for the health information management suite and two to three years for care and patient revenue management products 
these services are typically provided subsequent to the signing of a software license agreement and are integral to the delivery of our software licenses to our customers 
our maintenance revenue depends on both new licenses of our software products and renewals of maintenance agreements by our existing customer base 
services revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in an increase of million was attributable to a full year of service contracts for the qcpr products  this was partially offset by a decrease of million for our smart identity management clean up services in  compared to maintenance revenue increased million  or  in to million  compared to million in this increase is principally due to an increase of million for the qcpr products 
installation and other revenue related to the health information management suite term licenses is recognized ratably over the license term 
installation revenue for health information management suite  patient access and government solutions products is typically recognized upon completion of implementation 
installation revenue for our other products  including care and patient revenue management and qcpr products  is recognized on a contract basis of accounting 
installation and other revenue increased million  or in to million  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the net effect of several factors 
increases of million for qcpr products  million for smart identity management products  for electronic document management products and a million for the health information management suite  were partially offset by a million decrease for our care and patient revenue management products and a million decrease for the government solutions products 
the increase for our qcpr products is due to revenue recognized on customer installations for the increases for smart identity management  electronic document management and health information management suite products were attributable to an increase in the number and size of active contracts completed in installation revenue for the patient revenue management products decreased due to decreased hours worked on contracts that were being recognized on the percentage of completion method  the decrease for the government solutions products was attributable to a reduction in the number of installation and training projects completed in compared to licenses 
license revenue consists of fees and licenses for our owned  proprietary software  as well as third party owned software that we bundle into our suite of products 
overall  license revenue increased million  or  to million in compared to million in term license revenue increased  or million  to million in from million in term license revenue for government solutions products increased by million in to million from million in  this was due primarily to the contractual increase in the license fees for the department of veterans affairs 
offsetting this in part was a million decrease due to a combination of other factors  net 
perpetual license revenue increased  or million  to million in from million in increases of million for qcpr  million for electronic document management  million for enterprise scheduling  and million for smart identity management were partially offset by a decrease of million for the care and patient revenue management products 
the decrease for care and patient revenue management was driven by fewer active contracts in the increase for qcpr was due to the 
table of contents acquisition of the product line in september an increased number and size of active contracts in contributed to the increases for electronic document management  scheduling and smart identity management 
hardware 
hardware revenue consists of the sale of third party hardware purchased specifically for use by our customers 
hardware revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to hardware revenue recognized in related to a sale of a large hardware configuration to a single customer  there was no similar type or size of sale in deferred revenue the following table presents a summary roll forward schedule of the deferred revenue in thousands for each quarter of the respective years for the three months ended  march  june  september  december  total unaudited unaudited unaudited unaudited deferred revenue  beginning balance add revenue deferred less deferred revenue recognized deferred revenue  ending balance for the three months ended  march  june  september  december  total unaudited unaudited unaudited unaudited deferred revenue  beginning balance add revenue deferred add acquired deferred revenue  net cpr less deferred revenue recognized less acquired deferred revenue recognized  net cpr deferred revenue  ending balance deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
fluctuation within the deferred revenue balance is dependent upon the timing associated with reaching billing milestones and revenue recognition criteria 
deferred revenue is typically increased when the company invoices a customer based on the terms of the contracts and is decreased when revenue is recognized based on percentage of completion  the attainment of a milestone  or the passage of time in the case of a contract recognized ratably 
the majority of the company s revenue flows through the deferred revenue accounts due to favorable payment terms such as execution payments and achievement of billing milestones prior to meeting all revenue recognition requirements 
deferred revenue tends to be greater in the first quarter of each year compared to subsequent quarters due to the issuance of a greater number of annual maintenance invoices 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the veterans health administration prepaid its annual term license fees  significantly increasing deferred revenue  no payments were received for these licenses in the fourth quarter of the deferred revenue balance increased approximately million to million at december  when compared to million at december  the year end balance was comprised of million in license revenue  million in maintenance revenue  and million in services and other revenue 
at the end of  the balance was comprised of million in license revenue  million in maintenance revenue  and million in services and other revenue 
the increase in the deferred revenue 
table of contents balance during compared to december  was principally attributable to an increase in the deferred revenue related to our veterans health administration license discussed above  as of december   the balance included million for veterans health administration contracts compared to only million as of december  cost of revenue and gross margin cost of services and other revenue 
cost of services and other revenue consists of salaries and related expenses associated with services performed for customer support  installation  maintenance and consulting services as well as payments to third party vendors 
cost of services and other revenue increased  or million  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs attributable to the cpr business acquisition at the end of september  and contract related expenses for temporary staff and contractors  as well as to increased maintenance costs for third party applications associated with higher maintenance revenue in  overall  revenues from services  maintenance  installation and other revenues increased million  or between years 
as a percentage of services and other revenue  cost of services and other was in compared to in cost of licenses 
cost of licenses consists primarily of third party software costs  royalties and amortization of capitalized software and acquired technology 
a significant percentage of our total cost of revenue is attributable to royalties and licenses relating to third party software embedded within our own applications 
generally  royalties fluctuate based on revenue  the number of customers or the number of licensed users  and therefore may fluctuate on a quarter to quarter or year to year basis 
royalties are typically associated with our health information management suite and government solutions product revenues 
cost of licenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to renegotiated rates with some of our vendors and a net decrease in amortization of acquired and capitalized software 
as a percentage of license revenue  cost of license was in compared to in  primarily due to changes in the revenue mix within the health information management suite and government solutions product lines 
cost of hardware 
cost of hardware consists of third party hardware and installation costs from the sale of hardware to our customers in connection with the implementation of our software 
cost of hardware decreased  or million  to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the large hardware sale to a single customer during  at virtually no margin  there was no similar type or size of sale in as a percentage of hardware revenue  cost of hardware was in compared to in gross margin 
total gross margin increased by approximately million  or  to million in from million in overall  gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at during both and gross margin on license revenue  the most significant component of our total gross margin  was in compared to in  this increase in margin was due primarily to the recognition in q and q of revenue that had been deferred for older contracts and service agreements  the completion of a significant implementation project for edm products  higher qcpr related revenue  and lower acquired software amortization 
gross margin on services and other revenue was for compared to in  this decline was due primarily to an increase in personnel related costs resulting from the cpr business acquisition at the end of september operating expenses general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists of compensation and benefit costs for executive  finance  legal  information technology  and administrative personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense was in both and in  general and administrative expense increased primarily due to million higher salary and wage related expenses  a 
table of contents million increase in bad debt expense  and increased shareholder relations costs with regard to our move to the nasdaq global market 
software development 
software development expense includes costs associated with the development of new products for which technological feasibility has not been achieved  enhancements of existing products  and quality assurance activities 
these expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs 
software development expense increased million  or  to million in from million in in  the increase was primarily related to million of contractor fees in connection with our strategic decision to partner with tata consultancy services to assist us with quality assurance  technical publications and software programming  which was offset by the elimination of internal positions reducing salary and wage related expenses by approximately million 
as a percentage of revenue  software development expense was in compared to in there were no capitalized software development costs in or sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense includes costs associated with our sales  marketing and certain product management personnel  and consists primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  bonuses  and promotional and advertising expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  or million  in to million from million in this increase is primarily attributable to million higher salary and wage related costs resulting from the cpr business acquisition in september  incremental professional fees  higher travel costs due in part to the integration of the cpr business acquisition  and the cost of employee stock options 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expense was approximately for both fiscal year and amortization of intangible assets and depreciation 
amortization of intangible assets and depreciation expense decreased million to million in from million in this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in amortization expense following the sale of intangible assets as part of our april sale of stand alone lab and radiology products from our australian and uk subsidiaries and completion of amortization periods for other intangible assets 
as a percentage of revenue  amortization of intangible assets and depreciation decreased to in compared to in loss on sale of assets during  we recorded a million loss on the sale of assets related to the sale of stand alone lab and radiology products and related assets from our australian and uk subsidiaries
