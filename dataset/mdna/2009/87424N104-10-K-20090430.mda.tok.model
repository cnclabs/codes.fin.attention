the talent management market talent management encompasses multiple complex processes with interconnected elements that together play a vital role in attracting  sourcing  assessing  hiring  developing and aligning human capital to our customers business objectives 
most organizations no longer view human capital solely as an expense to be minimized  but instead as an asset to be optimized 
this shift in thinking has mirrored the evolution of talent management from a manual  paper based practice to a technology enabled  organization wide strategic business initiative 
over the past several years  organizations have implemented systems to automate many critical business functions 
while this automation has generated large volumes of data and business information  the critical knowledge within organizations resides with its employees 
accordingly  much of the value of the organization resides in its human capital 
to increase their return on investment in human capital  organizations have begun to shift their focus from traditional cost and time per hire metrics to more strategic considerations 
these considerations include quality of hire  time to productivity  internal mobility  employee retention  employee engagement  and employee contribution measures 
systematically pursuing these goals increases overall workforce productivity by enabling talent to be more optimally assigned and redeployed to address business needs 
a comprehensive  unified view of talent management requires solutions that not only automate discrete recruiting and performance management transactions  but also improve the effectiveness and consistency of recruiting and talent management processes through a more consistent competencies inventory management process  thereby increasing the quality of hire  employee retention  and productivity 

table of contents our software as a service delivery model our on demand  software as a service  delivery model enables our proprietary software solutions to be implemented  accessed and used by our customers remotely through an internet connection  a standard web browser and a variety of other access points such as smart phones  hand held devices  and productivity tools  like microsoft outlook 
our solutions are hosted and maintained by us  thus eliminating for our customers the time  risk  headcount and costs associated with installing and maintaining applications within their own information technology infrastructures 
as a result  our solutions require less initial investment in third party software  hardware and implementation services  and have lower ongoing support costs than traditional enterprise software 
the saas model also allows advanced information technology infrastructure management  security  disaster recovery and other best practices to be leveraged by smaller customers that might not otherwise be able to implement such practices in their own information technology environments

our saas delivery model also enables us to take advantage of operational efficiencies

as we continue to incur costs associated with regulatory compliance and being a public company and implement initiatives to grow our business  which include  among other things  acquisitions  international expansion and new product development  any failure to increase revenue or manage our cost structure could prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability 
as a result  our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline 
in the year ended december   we incurred losses largely as a result of expenses and charges associated with our recent acquisition of vurv technology  inc on july  in the near term  we expect to incur losses as a result of the increased amortization expense associated with the acquisition of vurv 
also  expenses for a significant portion of our consulting services are recognized in advance of the recognition of revenue associated with the same consulting services  as revenue is deferred to future periods and recognized ratably over the term of the related application services agreement  while the expense associated with such consulting services are recognized in the period incurred 
accordingly  if our consulting services business grows  we may experience a negative impact on profitability 
in addition  we may incur losses as a result of revenue shortfalls or increased expenses associated with our business 
as a result  our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline 
unfavorable economic conditions and reductions in information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business 
our operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in economic conditions globally and within the industries in which our customers operate 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for enterprise application software and services 
our revenue is derived from organizations whose businesses may fluctuate with global economic and business conditions 
historically  economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in corporate information technology spending 
accordingly  the current downturn in global economic conditions may weaken demand for our software and services 
in addition  an economic decline impacting a particular industry may negatively impact demand for our software and services in the affected industry 
many of the industries we serve  including financial services  technology and retail  have recently suffered a downturn in economic and business conditions and may continue to do so 
a softening of demand for enterprise application software and services  and in particular enterprise talent management solutions  caused by a weakening global economy or economic downturn in a particular sector would adversely effect our business and likely cause a decline in our revenue 
we will likely experience longer sales cycles and increased pricing pressure as a result of unfavorable economic conditions 
if general economic conditions worsen or fail to improve  we will likely continue to experience the conditions that began in the first quarter of of increased delays in our sales cycles and increased pressure from prospective customers to offer discounts on software subscriptions and consulting services higher than our historical practices 
we may also experience increased pressure from existing customers to renew expiring software subscriptions agreements at lower rates 
in addition  certain of our customers may attempt to negotiate lower software subscription fees for existing arrangements because of downturns in their businesses 
if we choose to accept certain request for higher discounts or lower fees  our business may be adversely affected and our revenues may decline 
we also believe certain of our competitors may offer lower fees for their products and services as a result of the current economic environment  which may put further downward pressure on our fees 
additionally  certain of our customers may become bankrupt or insolvent as a result of the current economic downturn  and we may lose all revenue from such customers 
we may not successfully integrate vurv s business operations with our own 
as a result  we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition  which could adversely affect our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
on july   we completed our acquisition of vurv technology  inc  our largest acquisition to date 
we have limited experience in integrating an acquired company  and successful integration of vurv s business operations will place an additional burden on our management and infrastructure 
our acquisition of vurv subjects us to a number of risks  including the following we may have difficulty renewing former vurv customers at the expiration of their current agreements  
table of contents we may be unable to convert certain vurv customers including in particular those that previously entered into perpetual licenses and customer on premise hosting arrangements to the taleo platform and our vendor hosted  subscription model  we may find it difficult to support or migrate vurv customers that are using specific customized versions of the vurv software to our solutions  as we historically have maintained a single version of each release of our software applications without customer specific code customization  we may have difficultly identifying and correcting deficiencies in vurv s internal controls over financial reporting  we terminated a significant number of vurv employees in connection with the acquisition  and may have difficulty retaining key vurv employees over time  we will incur additional expense to maintain and support the vurv product lines for up to three years while customers are migrated to the taleo platform  we may find it difficult to integrate vurv s hosting infrastructure and operations with our own hosting operations  jacksonville  florida may be more expensive or less productive than we anticipate as a software development and support location  and we may not have sufficient cash balances to fund other investments that become available to us over time as a result of our decreased cash balance due to the cash consideration paid in connection with the acquisition  or we may be required to seek additional sources of funding in order to make new investments 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with our acquisition of vurv 
to the extent that we are unable to successfully manage these risks  our business  operating results  or financial condition could be adversely affected  and the price of our common stock could decline 
because we recognize revenue over the term of the agreement for our software subscriptions and for a significant portion of our consulting service agreements  a significant downturn in our business may not be reflected immediately in our operating results  or our consulting revenue reported for a particular period may not be indicative of trends in our consulting business  which increases the difficulty of evaluating our future financial position 
we generally recognize revenue from software subscription agreements ratably over the terms of these agreements  which are typically three or more years for our taleo enterprise edition customers and one year for our taleo business edition customers 
as a result  a substantial majority of our software subscription revenue in each quarter is generated from software subscription agreements entered into during prior periods 
consequently  a decline in new software subscription agreements in any one quarter may not affect our results of operations in that quarter but will reduce our revenue in future quarters 
additionally  the timing of renewals or non renewals of a software subscription agreement during any one quarter may also affect our financial performance in that particular quarter 
for example  because we recognize revenue ratably  the non renewal of a software subscription agreement late in a quarter will have very little impact on revenue for that quarter  but will reduce our revenue in future quarters 
accordingly  the effect of significant declines in sales and market acceptance of our solutions may not be reflected in our short term results of operations  which would make these reported results less indicative of our future financial results 
by contrast  a non renewal occurring early in a quarter may have a significant negative impact on revenue for that quarter and we may not be able to offset a decline in revenue due to such non renewals with revenue from new software subscription agreements entered into in the same quarter 
in addition  we may be unable to adjust our costs in response to reduced revenue 
additionally  when we sell software subscriptions and consulting services in a single arrangement  we recognize revenue from consulting services ratably over the term of the software subscription agreement  which is typically three or more years  rather than as the consulting services are delivered  which is typically during the first six to nine months of a software subscription agreement 
accordingly  a significant portion of the revenue for consulting services performed in any quarterly reporting period will be deferred to future periods 
as a result  our consulting revenue for any quarterly reporting period may not be reflective of the consulting services delivered during the reporting period or of the business trends with respect to our consulting services business 
further  since we recognize expenses related to our consulting services in the period in which the expenses are incurred  the consulting margins we report in any quarterly reporting period may not be indicative of the actual gross margin on consulting services delivered during the reporting period 

table of contents if our existing customers do not renew their software subscriptions and buy additional solutions from us  our business will suffer 
we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewal of software subscriptions and  to a lesser extent  service fees from our existing customers 
as a result  maintaining the renewal rate of our software subscriptions is critical to our future success 
factors that may affect the renewal rate for our solutions include the price  performance and functionality of our solutions  the availability  price  performance and functionality of competing products and services  the effectiveness of our maintenance and support services  our ability to develop complementary products and services  and the stability  performance and security of our hosting infrastructure and hosting services 
most of our taleo enterprise edition customers enter into software subscription agreements with a duration of three years or more from the initial contract date 
most of our taleo business edition customers enter into annual software subscription agreements 
our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of the initial term of their agreements 
in addition  our customers may negotiate terms less advantageous to us upon renewal  which may reduce our revenue from these customers  or may request that we license our software to them on a perpetual basis  which may  after we have ratably recognized the revenue for the perpetual license over the relevant term in accordance with our revenue recognition policies  reduce recurring revenue from these customers 
under certain circumstances  our customers may cancel their subscriptions for our solutions prior to the expiration of the term 
our future success also depends  in part  on our ability to sell new products and services to our existing customers 
if our customers terminate their agreements  fail to renew their agreements  renew their agreements upon less favorable terms  or fail to buy new products and services from us  our revenue may decline or our future revenue may be constrained 
in addition  vurv has historically offered perpetual licenses and customer on premise hosting for certain of its products  while we have historically maintained a single version of each release of our software applications that is configurable to meet the needs of our customers without customer specific code customizations 
if we are unable to convert such vurv customers to our taleo hosted  subscription model  our future revenues may be adversely impacted 
if our efforts to attract new customers are not successful  our revenue growth will be adversely affected 
in order to grow our business  we must continually add new customers 
our ability to attract new customers will depend in large part on the success of our sales and marketing efforts 
however  our prospective customers may not be familiar with our solutions  or may have traditionally used other products and services for their talent management requirements 
in addition  our prospective customers may develop their own solutions to address their talent management requirements  purchase competitive product offerings  or engage third party providers of outsourced talent management services that do not use our solution to provide their services 
if our prospective customers do not perceive our products and services to be of sufficiently high value and quality  we may not be able to attract new customers 
in addition  certain of our prospective customers may delay or discontinue sales cycles as a result of the current negative general economic conditions or downturns in their businesses 
some prospective customers may request that we license our software to them on a perpetual basis  which may  after we have ratably recognized the revenue for the perpetual license over the relevant term in accordance with our revenue recognition policies  reduce recurring revenue from these customers 
to date  we have completed a limited number of agreements with such terms 
if we do not compete effectively with companies offering talent management solutions  our revenue may not grow and could decline 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  intense competition from a number of companies 
our taleo enterprise edition solution competes with vendors of enterprise resource planning software such as oracle corporation and sap ag  and also with vendors such as adp  authoria  cezane  cornerstone ondemand  halogen software  hrsmart  jobpartners  kenexa  kronos  peopleclick  pilat  plateau  salary 
com  stepstone  successfactors  technomedia  teds  workday  and workstream  that offer products and services that compete with one or more modules in our taleo enterprise edition suite of solutions 
our taleo business edition solution competes primarily with bullhorn  hiredesk  icims  openhire  monster 
com  and virtual edge from adp 
our competitors may announce new products  services or enhancements that better meet changing industry standards or the price or performance needs of customers 
increased competition may cause pricing pressure and loss of market share  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents certain of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  development  marketing  sales  service and other resources than we have 
some of these companies also have a larger installed base of customers  longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we have 
certain of our competitors provide products that may incorporate capabilities which are not available in our current suite of solutions  such as automated payroll and benefits  or services that we do not currently offer  such as recruitment process outsourcing services 
products with such additional functionalities may be appealing to some customers because they can reduce the number of different types of software or applications used to run their business and such additional services may be viewed by some customers as enhancing the effectiveness of a competitor s solutions 
in addition  our competitors products may be more effective than our products at performing particular talent management functions or may be more customized for particular customer needs in a given market 
further  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to changes in customer requirements 
our customers often require our products to be integrated with software provided by our existing or potential competitors 
these competitors could alter their products in ways that inhibit integration with our products  or they could deny or delay access by us to advance software releases  which would restrict our ability to adapt our products to facilitate integration with these new releases and could result in lost sales opportunities 
in addition  many organizations have developed or may develop internal solutions to address talent management requirements that may be competitive with our solutions 
our stock price is likely to be volatile and could decline 
the stock market in general and the market for technology related stocks in particular has been highly volatile 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock is likely to be similarly volatile  and investors in our class a common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their stock  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
the price of our class a common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including those listed in this risk factors section and others such as our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  overall performance of the equity markets  developments with respect to intellectual property rights  publication of unfavorable research reports about us or our industry or withdrawal of research  coverage by securities analysts or lack of coverage by securities analysts  speculation in the press or investment community  general economic conditions and data and the impact of such conditions and data on the equity markets  terrorist acts  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new technologies  acquisitions  commercial relationships  joint ventures  or capital commitments 
the consolidation of our competitors or other similar strategic alliances could weaken our competitive position or reduce our revenue 
there has been vendor consolidation in the market in which we operate over the past few years 
for example  kronos acquired unicru in and recently acquired deploy solutions 
kronos itself was acquired in by the private equity firm hellman friedman 
kenexa acquired brassring in and adp acquired virtualedge in in  we acquired vurv technology  inc these transactions  or additional consolidation within our industry may change in the competitive landscape in ways that adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future bpo partners  hro partners  systems integrators  third party consulting firms or other parties with whom we have relationships  thereby limiting our ability to promote our products and limiting the number of consultants available to implement our solutions 
disruptions in our business caused by these events could reduce our revenue 

table of contents the results of our review of our revenue recognition practices and resulting restatement may continue to have adverse effects on our financial results 
our review of our revenue recognition practices and the resulting restatement of our historical financial statements have required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting  legal  and other expenses 
the accounting  legal and other expenses associated with the restatement have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as a result of our revenue recognition review and the resulting restatement  revenue from consulting services totaling approximately million reported in our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  through  and our interim consolidated financial statements for each of the periods ended march  and june   will be deferred to periods after june  additionally  the correction relating to the timing of revenue recognition for set up fees  an element of application services revenue  will result in the deferral of approximately million in application revenue recognized as of june  to periods after june  see the explanatory note regarding restatement immediately preceding part i  item and note restatement of consolidated financial statements to notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for further discussion 
in addition  litigation has been filed against us  our current officers and certain of our former officers relating to a failure to apply gaap in the reporting of quarterly and annual financial statements and securities prospectuses from the time of our initial public offering to our most recent filing with the sec 
see part i  item legal proceedings for a more detailed description of these proceedings 
we may become the subject of additional private or government actions regarding these matters in the future 
these proceedings are in the preliminary stages  and their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the trading price for our securities 
litigation may be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the defense of this litigation will result in significant expenditures and the continued diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our business 
while we maintain standard directors and officers insurance  all or a portion of any amount we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any or all of these claims may not be covered by insurance 
we have had to restate our historical financial statements 
in march  we announced that we had completed a review of our revenue recognition practices and  as a result of this review  would restate certain financial statements and defer to future periods million of consulting services revenue previously recognized through june  amounts in our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  through  and the interim consolidated financial statements for each of the periods ended march  and june   have been corrected for the timing of revenue recognition for consulting services revenue during these periods  as well as to correct an error relating to consulting services revenue recognition and the timing of revenue recognition for set up fees  an element of our application services revenue 
in connection with such review we identified certain control deficiencies relating to the application of applicable accounting literature related to revenue recognition 
these deficiencies constituted a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of september   which led to corrections in our historical financial statements and our conclusion to restate such financial statements to correct those items 
specifically  the control deficiencies related to our failure to correctly interpret emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple element deliverables eitf  in determining the proper accounting treatment when application and consulting services are sold together 
in connection with the december  year end audit of our financial statements  management and with our independent registered public accounting firm identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that were deemed to be material weaknesses 
in particular  we discovered errors in respect to depreciation of fixed assets  and accrual of dividends on preferred stock which required adjustment 
as a result  we restated our consolidated financial statements 
we also identified a failure to appropriately apply gaap to certain aspects of our financial reporting resulting from the lack of a properly designed financial reporting process and a lack of sufficient technical accounting expertise 
certain of such deficiencies were also deemed to be material weaknesses  which we remediated as of december we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken since these restatements will ensure that restatements will not occur in the future 
execution of restatements like the ones described above could create a significant strain on our internal resources and cause delays in our filing of quarterly or annual financial results  increase our costs and cause management distraction 
failure to implement and maintain the appropriate internal controls over financial reporting could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate and timely financial information 
during we completed a review and redesign of our internal controls over financial reporting related to our closing procedures and processes  our calculations of our reported numbers  including depreciation expense and fixed assets  and the need to strengthen our technical accounting expertise 
despite these efforts  we identified a material weakness in connection with the evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls as of march  prior to the filing of our financial results for the period ended march   related to the identification of a material adjustment required  which affected cash  accounts receivable and cash flow from operations 
additionally in third quarter of  we identified certain control deficiencies relating to the application of applicable accounting literature related to revenue recognition 
these deficiencies constituted a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of september  as part of our ongoing processes we will continue to focus on improvements in our controls over financial reporting 
we have discussed deficiencies in our financial reporting and remediation of such deficiencies with the audit committee of our board of directors and will continue to do so as required 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to remediate all deficiencies in the future 
any current or future deficiencies could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information 

table of contents we have not been in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements 
if we are unable to attain compliance with  or thereafter remain in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements  there may be a material adverse effect on our business and our stockholders 
as a consequence of our review of our revenue recognition practices and resulting restatement of our historical financial statements  we were unable to file our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly report on form q for the period ended september  with the sec on a timely basis and continue to face the possibility of delisting of our stock from the nasdaq global market 
we have now filed this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly report on form q for the period ended september  until we have returned to full compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements  the possibility of a nasdaq delisting exists 
if this happens  the price of our stock and the ability of our stockholders to trade in our stock would be adversely affected 
in addition  we would be subject to a number of restrictions regarding the registration of our stock under federal securities laws  and we would not be able to allow our employees to exercise their outstanding options  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
furthermore  if we are delisted in the future from the nasdaq global market  there may be other negative implications  including the potential loss of confidence by customers  suppliers and employees and the loss of institutional investor interest in our company 
as a result of the delayed filing of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  as well as our quarterly report on form q for the period ended september   we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others until one year from the date the last delinquent filing is made 
we may use form s to raise capital or complete acquisitions  but doing so could increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner 
our financial performance may be difficult to forecast as a result of our historical focus on large customers and the long sales cycle associated with our solutions 
the majority of our revenue is currently derived from organizations with complex talent management requirements 
accordingly  in a particular quarter the majority of our bookings from new customers on an aggregate contract value basis are from large sales made to a relatively small number of customers 
as such  our failure to close a sale in a particular quarter will impede desired revenue growth unless and until the sale closes 
in addition  sales cycles for our taleo enterprise edition clients are generally between three months and one year  and in some cases can be longer 
as a result  substantial time and cost may be spent attempting to secure a sale that may not be successful 
the period between our first sales call on a prospective customer and a contract signing is relatively long due to several factors such as the complex nature of our solutions  the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our solutions  the relatively long duration of our contracts  the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles  the competitive evaluation of our solutions  fluctuations in the staffing management requirements of our prospective customers  announcements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors  and the lengthy purchasing approval processes of our prospective customers 
if our sales cycles unexpectedly lengthen  our ability to forecast accurately the timing of sales in any given period will be adversely affected and we may not meet our forecasts for that period 

table of contents if we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance our existing products to meet the needs of our existing and future customers  our sales will decline 
to keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements  and achieve market acceptance  we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and services 
for instance  in february our performance management software product became generally available in the market 
any new products we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue 
if we are unable to develop or acquire new products that appeal to our target customer base or enhance our existing products or if we fail to price our products to meet market demand or if the products we develop or acquire do not meet performance expectations or have a higher than expected cost structure to host and maintain  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
our efforts to expand our solutions beyond our current offerings or beyond the talent management market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business  which may harm our existing business 
we expect to incur additional expense to develop software products and to integrate acquired software products into existing platforms to maintain our competitive position 
for example  our acquisition of vurv will require significant effort to maintain existing vurv products in addition to ours and to integrate the products of both companies over time 
in addition  we have invested in software development locations other than the locations where we traditionally developed our software 
for example  we have invested in development locations in eastern europe  ukraine and asia  and we may invest in other locations outside of north america in the future 
in addition  we plan to continue to invest in jacksonville  florida  the former headquarters site of vurv  as a software development location 
we may engage independent contractors for all or portions of this work 
these efforts may not result in commercially viable solutions  may be more expensive or less productive than we anticipate  or may be difficult to manage and result in distraction to our management team 
if we do not manage these remote development centers effectively or receive significant revenue from our product development investments  our business will be adversely affected 
additionally  we intend to maintain a single version of each release of our software applications that is configurable to meet the needs of our customers 
customers may require customized solutions or features and functions that we do not yet offer and do not intend to offer in future releases  which may disrupt out ability to maintain a single version of our software releases or cause our customers to choose a competing solution 
vurv has historically allowed customer specific customizations of its software and we may find it difficult to support or migrate such customizations 
acquisitions and investments present many risks  and we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions  which would harm our business  operating results and overall financial condition 
in addition  we have limited experience in acquiring and integrating other companies 
we have made  and may continue to make  acquisitions or investments in companies  products  services  and technologies to expand our product offerings  customer base and business 
for example  in  we completed our acquisition of vurv  which is our largest acquisition to date  and made an equity investment in worldwide compensation  inc  our first such investment 
we have limited experience in executing acquisitions and investments 
acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks  including the following being unable to achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions  discovering that we may have difficulty integrating the accounting systems  operations  and personnel of the acquired business  and may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business  our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations  difficulty incorporating the acquired technologies or products into our existing code base  problems arising from differences in the revenue  licensing or support model of the acquired business  customer confusion regarding the positioning of acquired technologies or products  difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations  difficulty retaining the acquired business customers  and problems or liabilities associated with product quality  technology and legal contingencies 

table of contents the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results 
if we should proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any such acquisition 
to the extent that we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock  existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease 
for example  in connection with our acquisition of vurv  we paid approximately million in cash  approximately million shares of class a common stock  and repaid approximately million of vurv s debt 
we also assumed obligations for options to purchase shares of vurv common stock  which were converted into options to purchase approximately million of our class a common stock 
in addition  acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt  material one time write offs  or purchase accounting adjustments and restructuring charges 
they may also result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets in our financial statements which may be subject to future impairment charges or ongoing amortization costs  thereby reducing future earnings 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated 
such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time  as well as incurring expenses that may impact operating results 
we have discontinued the time and expense processing services of our taleo contingent solution 
we may have difficulty replacing the revenue from these customers 
effective march  we ceased entering into agreements to provide time and expense processing services for temporary workers 
fees for time and expense processing through our taleo contingent product declined throughout  however  on an annualized basis such fees were still significant in revenue from time and expense processing effectively ended on august  we may find it difficult to replace the revenue we once received from the processing of temporary worker time and expense transactions and our results may be negatively impacted 
we may lose sales opportunities if we do not successfully develop and maintain strategic relationships to sell and deliver our solutions 
we have partnered with a number of business process outsourcing  or bpo  and human resource outsourcing  or hro  providers that resell our staffing solutions as a component of their outsourced human resource services and we intended to partner with more in the future 
if customers or potential customers begin to outsource their talent management functions to bpos or hros that do not resell our solutions  or to bpos or hros that choose to develop their own solutions  our business will be harmed 
in addition  we have relationships with third party consulting firms  system integrators and software and service vendors who provide us with customer referrals  integrate their complementary products with ours  cooperate with us in marketing our products and provide our customers with system implementation or other consulting services 
if we fail to establish new strategic relationships or expand our existing relationships  or should any of these partners fail to work effectively with us or go out of business  our ability to sell our products into new markets and to increase our penetration into existing markets may be impaired 
if we are required to reduce our prices to compete successfully  our margins and operating results could be adversely affected 
the intensely competitive market in which we do business may require us to reduce our prices 
if our competitors offer discounts on certain products or services we may be required to lower prices or offer our solutions on less favorable terms to compete successfully 
some of our larger competitors have significantly greater resources than we have and are better able to absorb short term losses 
any such changes would likely reduce our margins and could adversely affect our operating results 
some of our competitors may provide bundled product offerings that compete with ours for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy 
these practices could  over time  limit the prices that we can charge for our products or services 
if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the quantity of applications sold  our margins and operating results would be adversely affected 
if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to customer data  customers may curtail or stop their use of our solutions  which would harm our reputation  operating results  and financial condition 
our solutions involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to loss of this information  litigation and possible liability 
while we have security measures in place  if our security measures are breached as a result of third party action  employee error  criminal acts by an employee  malfeasance  or otherwise  and  as a result  someone obtains unauthorized access to customer data  our reputation will be damaged  our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability 
techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target 
as a result  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
unless our customers elect to purchase encryption  we do not encrypt data we store for our customers while such data is at rest in the database 
applicable law may require that a security breach involving certain types of unencrypted data be publicly disclosed 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to failures in our security measures 

table of contents defects or errors in our products could affect our reputation  result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products  which would harm our business 
our products may contain defects or errors  which could materially and adversely affect our reputation  result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products in the future 
the costs incurred in correcting any product defects or errors may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results 
while we test our products for defects or errors prior to product release  defects or errors have been identified from time to time by our customers and may continue to be identified in the future 
any defects that cause interruptions in the availability or functionality of our solutions could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products  loss of customers  product liability and breach of warranty suits against us  diversion of development and support resources  injury to our reputation  and increased maintenance and warranty costs 
while our software subscription agreements typically contain limitations and disclaimers that should limit our liability for damages related to defects in our software  such limitations and disclaimers may not be upheld by a court or other tribunal or otherwise protect us from such claims 
if we fail to manage our hosting infrastructure capacity satisfactorily  our existing customers may experience service outages and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our solution 
we have experienced significant growth in the number of users  transactions  and data that our hosting infrastructure supports 
failure to address the increasing demands on our hosting infrastructure satisfactorily may result in service outages  delays or disruptions 
for example  we have experienced downtimes within our hosting infrastructure  some of which have been significant  which have prevented customers from using our solutions from time to time 
we seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our hosting infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers 
we also maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provisioning of new customer deployments and expansion of existing customer deployments 
the development of new hosting infrastructure to keep pace with expanding storage and processing requirements could be a significant cost to us that we are not able to predict accurately and for which we are not able to budget significantly in advance 
such outlays could raise our cost of goods sold and be detrimental to our financial results 
at the same time  the development of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead time 
if we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements  our existing customers may experience service outages that may subject us to financial penalties  financial liabilities and the loss of customers 
if our hosting infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with sales  customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity  which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth 
integrating the hosting infrastructure of vurv and other acquired entities may increase these challenges 
in addition  we recently brought to market a performance management product for which we may not be able to accurately predict the number of users  transactions and infrastructure demands 
such a failure could result in system outages for our customers and higher than expected costs to support and maintain our performance management solution  which could negatively affect our reputation and our financial results 
any significant disruption in our computing and communications infrastructure could harm our reputation  result in a loss of customers and adversely affect our business 
our computing and communications infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations 
our customers access our solutions through a standard web browser 
our customers depend on us for fast and reliable access to our applications 
much of our software is proprietary  and we rely on the expertise of members of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our applications 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  serious disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure 
factors that may cause such disruptions include human error  
table of contents physical or electronic security breaches  telecommunications outages from third party providers  computer viruses  acts of terrorism or sabotage  fire  earthquake  flood and other natural disasters  and power loss 
although we back up data stored on our systems at least weekly  our infrastructure does not currently include real time  or near real time  mirroring of data storage and production capacity in more than one geographically distinct location 
thus  in the event of a physical disaster  or certain other failures of our computing infrastructure  customer data from recent transactions may be permanently lost 
we currently deliver our solutions from nine data centers that host the applications for all of our customers 
the taleo enterprise platform is hosted from three facilities a us facility leased from equinix  inc in san jose  california  a us facility leased from internap network services corporation in new york city  new york and a netherlands data center facility also leased from equinix in amsterdam 
internet bandwidth and access is provided by internap in the two us facilities and by equinix in the netherlands 
the taleo business edition is hosted through two us facilities a facility located in san jose  california and operated via a managed services arrangement and a facility located in san francisco  california to host the legacy vurv product for small and medium sized organizations 
opsource  inc provides hardware  internet bandwidth  and access in the san jose  california hosting facility through the managed services arrangement 
the vurv legacy enterprise recruiting product is hosted through four facilities a facility located in jacksonville  florida in the us  a facility located in atlanta  georgia in the us  a facility located in london  england and a facility located in sydney  australia 
internet bandwidth and access for the vurv legacy enterprise recruiting product is provided by peak in the usa florida facility  adapt plc in the england facility  and conexim australia pty ltd in the australia facility 
we do not control the operation of these facilities and must rely on these vendors to provide the physical security  facilities management and communications infrastructure services to ensure the reliable and consistent delivery of our solutions to our customers 
in the case of opsource and vurv locations that are managed service locations  we also rely upon the third party vendor for hardware associated with our hosting infrastructure 
although we believe we would be able to enter into a similar relationship with another third party should one of these relationships fail or terminate for any reason  we believe our reliance on any third party vendor exposes us to risks outside of our control 
if these third party vendors encounter financial difficulty such as bankruptcy or other event beyond our control that cause them to fail to secure adequately and maintain their hosting facilities or provide the required data communications capacity  our customers may experience interruptions in our service or the loss or theft of important customer data 
in the future  we may elect to open computing and communications hardware operations at additional third party facilities located in the united states  europe or other regions 
we are not experienced at operating such facilities in jurisdictions outside the united states and doing so may pose additional risk to us 
we have experienced system failures in the past 
if our customers experience service interruptions or the loss or theft of their data caused by us  we may be required to issue credits pursuant to the terms of our contracts and may also be subject to financial liability or customer losses 
such credits could reduce our revenues below the levels that we have indicated we expect to achieve and adversely affect our margins and operating results 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems 
we must hire and retain key employees and recruit qualified personnel or our future success and business could be harmed 
our success depends on the continued employment of our senior management and other key employees  such as our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer 
if we lose the services of one or more of our senior management or key employees  or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise to compete with us  our business could be harmed 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
additionally  our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales and other personnel 
it may be particularly challenging to retain employees as we integrate new acquisitions  like our recent acquisition of vurv  due to uncertainty among employees regarding their career options and cultural differences between us and vurv 

table of contents we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations and expect to expand our international operations 
however  we do not have substantial experience in international markets  and may not achieve the expected results 
during the year ended december   application revenue generated outside of the united states was of total revenue  based on the location of the legal entity of the customer with which we contracted  of which was revenue generated in canada 
our primary research and development operation is in quebec  canada  but we conduct research and development in other international locations as well 
we currently have international offices outside of north america in australia  france  the netherlands  singapore and the united kingdom  which focus primarily on selling and implementing our solutions in those regions 
in the future  we may expand to other international locations 
our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  taxes  trade laws  tariffs  export quotas  custom duties or other trade restrictions  differing regulations in quebec with regard to maintaining operations  products and public information in both french and english  differing labor regulations  especially in the european union and quebec  where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the united states  including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations  more stringent regulations relating to data privacy and the unauthorized use of  or access to  commercial and personal information  particularly in europe and canada  reluctance to allow personally identifiable data related to non us citizens to be stored in databases within the united states  due to concerns over the united states government s right to access personally identifiable data of non us citizens stored in databases within the united states or other concerns  greater difficulty in supporting and localizing our products  greater difficulty in localizing our marketing materials and legal agreements  including translations of these materials into local language  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees or independent contractors over large geographic distances  including the need to implement appropriate systems  policies  benefits and compliance programs  limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection  and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
if we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner  our business and operating results will suffer 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses  which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
we currently have foreign sales denominated in foreign currencies  including the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  the euro  new zealand dollar  singapore dollar and swiss franc and may in the future have sales denominated in the currencies of additional countries in which we establish or have established sales offices 
in addition  we incur a substantial portion of our operating expenses in canadian dollars and  to a much lesser extent  other foreign currencies 
any fluctuation in the exchange rate of these foreign currencies may negatively affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
for instance  in  the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the average rates in effect during was a million decrease in earnings 
in  we expect that the volatility in exchange rates for foreign currencies may continue and  as a result  we may continue to see fluctuations in our revenue and expenses  which may impact our operating results 
we have not previously engaged in foreign currency hedging 
if we decide to hedge our foreign currency exposure  we may not be able to hedge effectively due to lack of experience  unreasonable costs or illiquid markets 

table of contents if we fail to defend our proprietary rights aggressively  our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets  experience reduced revenue  and incur costly litigation fees to protect our rights 
our success is dependent  in part  upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services 
we do not have any issued patents and only one pending patent 
we do not rely on patent protection 
we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours 
some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of our licensed products may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries in which we operate 
further  the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
to the extent we expand our international activities  our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information may increase 
we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances 
no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information 
further  these agreements do not prevent our competitors from developing technologies independently that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
initiating legal action may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets 
litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources  either of which could seriously harm our business 
current and future litigation against us could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we are sometimes subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the course of business 
for example  we are currently defendants in a suit alleging patent infringement and a suit alleging securities fraud  both of which are described in more detail in part i  item legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources  which may seriously harm our business  overall financial condition  and operating results 
in addition  legal claims that have not yet been asserted against us may be asserted in the future 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for further information regarding pending and threatened litigation and potential claims 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are subject to a protracted infringement claim or a claim that results in a significant award for damages 
software product developers such as us may continue to receive infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our space grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
for example  kenexa  a competitor  filed suit against us for patent infringement in august and other infringement claims have been threatened against us 
we can give no assurance that such claims will not be filed in the future 
our competitors or other third parties may also challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights 
a claim may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties 
if we were subject to a claim of infringement  regardless of the merit of the claim or our defenses  the claim could require costly litigation to resolve and the payment of substantial damages  require significant management time  cause us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements  require us to discontinue the sale of our products  require us to indemnify our customers or third party service providers  or require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our products 
we entered into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business and may be required to indemnify our customers for our own products and third party products that are incorporated into our products and that infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
although many of the third parties from which we purchase are obligated to indemnify us if their products infringe the rights of others  this indemnification may not be adequate 
in addition  from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products 
we use open source software in our products and may use more open source software in the future 
as a result  we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software 
litigation could be costly for us to defend  have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products 

table of contents our insurance policies will not compensate us for any losses or liabilities resulting from patent infringement claims 
we employ technology licensed from third parties for use in or with our solutions  and the loss or inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs  or reduced service levels  which would adversely affect our business 
our hosted solutions incorporate certain technology obtained under licenses from other companies  such as oracle for database software 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology and development tools from third parties in the future 
although we believe that there are commercially reasonable software alternatives to the third party software we currently license  this may not always be the case  or we may license third party software that is more difficult or costly to replace than the third party software we currently license 
in addition  integration of our products with new third party software may require significant work and require substantial allocation of our time and resources 
also  to the extent that our products depend upon the successful operation of third party products in conjunction with our products  any undetected errors in these third party products could prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions and injure our reputation 
our use of additional or alternative third party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties  which could result in higher costs 
difficulties that we may encounter in managing changes in the size of our business could affect our operating results adversely 
in order to manage our business effectively  we must continually manage headcount in an efficient manner 
in the past  we have undergone facilities consolidations and headcount reductions in certain locations and departments 
as a result  we have incurred  and may incur  charges for employee severance 
we may experience additional facilities consolidations and headcount reductions in the future 
as many employees are located in jurisdictions outside of the united states  we are required to pay the severance amounts legally required in such jurisdictions  which may exceed those of the united states 
further  we believe reductions in our workforce and facility consolidation create anxiety and uncertainty  and may adversely affect employee morale 
these measures could adversely affect our employees that we wish to retain and may also adversely affect our ability to hire new personnel 
they may also negatively affect customers 
failure to manage our customer deployments effectively could increase our expenses and cause customer dissatisfaction 
enterprise deployments of our products require a substantial understanding of our customers businesses  and the resulting configuration of our solutions to their business processes and integration with their existing systems 
we may encounter difficulties in managing the timeliness of these deployments and the allocation of personnel and resources by us or our customers 
in certain situations  we also work with third party service providers in the implementation or software integration related services of our solutions  and we may experience difficulties in managing such third parties 
failure to manage customer implementation or software integration related services successfully by us or our third party service providers could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing customers  face potential customer disputes or limit the rate at which new customers purchase our solutions 
our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in generally accepted accounting principles or changes in our operating history that impact the application of generally accepted accounting principles 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  the public company accounting oversight board  or pcoab  the sec and various other organizations formed to promulgate and interpret accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our projected financial results 
pursuant to the application of gaap we recognize the majority of our application revenue monthly over the life of the application agreement 
in certain instances  the straight line revenue recognized on a monthly basis may exceed the amounts invoiced for the same period 
if our history of collecting all fees reflected in our application agreements negatively changes  the application of gaap may mandate that we not recognize revenue in excess of the fees invoiced over the corresponding period for new agreements 
the application of gaap also requires that we accomplish delivery of our solutions to our customers in order to recognize revenue associated with such solutions 
in the context of our model  delivery generally requires the creation of an instance of the solution that may be accessed by the customer via the internet 
we may experience difficulty in making new products available to our customers in this manner 
in the event we are not able to make our solutions available to our customer via the internet in a timely manner  due to resource constraints  implementation difficulties or other reasons  our ability to recognize revenue from the sales of our solutions may be delayed and our financial results may be negatively impacted 
the application of gaap to our operations may also require significant judgment and interpretation as to the appropriate treatment of a specific issue 
these judgments and interpretations are complicated by the relative newness of the on demand  vendor hosted software business model  also called software as a service or saas  and the relative lack of interpretive guidance with respect to the application of gaap to the saas model 
for example  in connection with our recent review of our revenue recognition practices  we submitted a pre clearance submission to the office of the chief accountant of the sec  or oca  requesting its view of our historical application of eitf following consultation with the oca  we changed our application of eitf see explanatory note regarding restatement immediately preceding part  item we cannot ensure that our interpretations and judgments with respect to the application of gaap will be correct in the future and any incorrect interpretations and judgments could adversely affect our business 

table of contents if tax benefits currently available under the tax laws of canada and the province of quebec are reduced or repealed  or if we have taken an incorrect position with respect to tax matters under discussion with the canadian revenue agency or other taxing authorities  our business could suffer 
the majority of our research and development activities are conducted through our canadian subsidiary  taleo canada inc we participate in a government program in quebec that provides investment credits based upon qualifying research and development expenditures 
these expenditures primarily consist of the salaries for the persons conducting research and development activities 
we have participated in the program since  and expect that we will continue to receive these investment tax credits through december in  we recorded a cad million reduction in our research and development expenses as a result of this program 
we anticipate the continued reduction of our research and development expenses through application of these credits through if these investment tax benefits are reduced or eliminated  our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 
in addition to the research and development investment credit program described above  our canadian subsidiary is participating in a scientific research and experimental development  or sred  program administered by the canadian federal government that provides income tax credits based upon qualifying research and development expenditures 
for tax year  we recorded a sred credit claims of approximately cad million and have estimated our sred credit claim to approximate cad million 
our canadian subsidiary is eligible to remain in the sred program for future tax years as long as its development projects continue to qualify 
these federal sred tax credits can only be applied to offset federal taxes payable and are reported as a credit to tax provision to the extent they reduce taxes payable to zero with any residual benefits recorded as a net deferred tax asset 
we believe that our canadian subsidiary is in compliance with these government programs and that all amounts recorded will be fully realized 
if these investment credits are reduced or disallowed by the canada revenue agency cra  our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 
our canadian subsidiary has been under examination by the canada revenue agency cra with respect to tax years and in december  we were issued a proposed notice of assessment by cra to increase taxable income by approximately cad million in respect to our tax year 
these adjustments relate  principally  to our treatment of cdti tax credits and income and expense allocations recorded between the company and our canadian subsidiary 
we disagree with cra s basis for their proposed adjustments and intend to appeal their decision through applicable administrative and judicial procedures 
also in december  taleo was notified by cra of their intention to audit tax years through no proposed assessment notices have been issued with respect to these open tax years 
we have settled certain issues raised in the and audit and are appealing the cra s treatment of quebec investment tax credits 
final resolution of the cra s examination will have bearing on the tax treatment applied in subsequent periods not currently under examination 
we have recorded income tax reserves believed to be sufficient to cover the estimated tax assessments for the open tax periods 
there could be a significant impact to our uncertain tax position over the next twelve months depending on the outcome of the on going cra audit 
in the event the cra audit results in adjustments that exceed both our income tax reserves and available deferred tax assets  our canadian subsidiary may become a tax paying entity in or in a prior year including potential penalties and interest 
any such penalties cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we are seeking united states tax treaty relief through the appropriate competent authority tribunals for the assessments and settlements entered into with cra and will seek treaty relief for all subsequent tax adjustments 
although we believe we have reasonable basis for our tax positions  it is possible an adverse outcome could have a material effect upon our financial condition  operating results or cash flows in a particular period or annual period 
as we continue to expand domestically and internationally  we may become subject to review by various us and foreign taxing authorities which could negatively impact our financial results 
while we have reserved for these uncertainties and do not expect the outcomes of these reviews to be material to our operations  our current assessment as to the potential financial impact of these reviews could prove incorrect and we may incur additional income tax expense in the period the uncertainty is resolved 

table of contents evolving regulation of the internet may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts  which may adversely affect our financial condition 
as internet commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal  state or foreign agencies may become more likely 
we are particularly sensitive to these risks because the internet is a critical component of our business model 
for example  we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy  and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation  collection  processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data  potentially reducing demand for solutions accessed via the internet and restricting our ability to store  process and share data with our customers via the internet 
in addition  taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed 
any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet based services  which could harm our business 
we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available  thereby adversely affecting our ability to operate our business 
if we need to raise additional funds due to unforeseen circumstances  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all  and any additional financings could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to meet our business objectives  our stock price may fall and you may lose some or all of your investment 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could increase the difficulty for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquirer would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms  which means that replacing a majority of our directors would require at least two annual meetings 
the acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to replace directors at any annual meeting  and will not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting  which will require the acquirer to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted 
our board of directors also has the ability to issue preferred stock that could significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law limits business combination transactions with or greater stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

finding that our reexamination request raised a substantial new question of patentability  the uspto ordered reexamination of patent no
