when discussing progress energy s financial information  it necessarily includes the results of pec and pef collectively  the utilities 
the term progress registrants refers to each of the three separate registrants progress energy  pec and pef 
information contained herein relating to pec and pef individually is filed by such company on its own behalf 
neither of the utilities makes any representation as to information related solely to progress energy or the subsidiaries of progress energy other than itself 
the following md a contains forward looking statements that involve estimates  projections  goals  forecasts  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
please review safe harbor for forward looking statements and item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
md a should be read in conjunction with the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
progress energy introduction our reportable business segments are pec and pef and their primary operations are the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of north carolina and south carolina and in portions of florida  respectively 
the corporate and other segment primarily includes the operations of the parent  progress energy service company  llc pesc and other miscellaneous nonregulated businesses that do not separately meet the quantitative requirements as a separate reportable business segment 
strategy we are an integrated energy company primarily focused on the end use electricity markets 
over the last several years we have reduced our business risk by exiting substantially all of our nonregulated businesses 
our two electric utilities operate in regulated retail utility markets in the southeastern united states and have access to attractive wholesale markets in the eastern united states  which we believe positions us well for long term growth 
please review safe harbor for forward looking statements and item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
we are focused on the following key priorities consistently excelling in the daily fundamentals of our utility business  including safely and reliably generating and delivering power to our customers the utilities have more than  megawatts mw of generation capacity  and their service territories cover approximately  square miles in the southeastern united states  which has historically been one of the fastest growing regions of the country 
we are focused on safely and reliably serving our customer base 
however  like other parts of the country  our service territories and business have been impacted by the current economic recession with corresponding downturns in the housing and consumer credit markets 
our customer growth has slowed significantly 
we had a net increase of approximately  retail customers over the past year compared to a net increase of  retail customers in however  we were able to mitigate our weaker than expected retail revenues with strategies of securing additional wholesale revenues and ongoing cost management 
we anticipate will be another challenging year given the recent financial market disruptions and worsening economic conditions 
successfully implementing our balanced solution for a secure energy future our balanced solution is a comprehensive plan to meet the anticipated demand in the utilities service territories and provide a solid basis for slowing and reducing carbon dioxide co emissions by focusing on energy efficiency  alternative energy and state of the art power generation 
first  we are expanding and enhancing our demand side management dsm  energy efficiency and energy conservation programs 
second  we are actively engaged in a variety of alternative energy projects and are evaluating the feasibility of producing electricity from these and other sources 
north carolina s minimum renewable energy portfolio standard begins in on january   the florida public service commission fpsc approved a draft state renewable portfolio standard rule with a goal of percent renewable energy production by  the rule requires legislative ratification before implementation 
third  we are evaluating new generation and fleet upgrades to meet the anticipated demand at both pec and pef toward the end of the next decade 
we are evaluating the best new generation options  including advanced design nuclear technology  gas fired combined cycle and combustion turbines  and modernization of existing coal plants to use clean coal technology 
the considerations that will factor into this decision include  but are not limited to  construction costs  fuel diversity  transmission and site availability  environmental impact  the rate impact to customers and our ability to obtain cost effective financing 
expenditures to achieve our balanced solution should be recoverable under base rates or cost recovery mechanisms that our state jurisdictions have implemented  or are in the process of implementing 
see other matters regulatory environment and note for additional information 
we are continuing to pursue new nuclear generation based on expectations of new federal climate policy as well as recognition of the need for new baseload generating capacity and better fuel diversity and energy security 
favorable changes in the regulatory and construction processes have evolved in recent years  including standardized design  detailed design before construction  combined license col to build and operate  streamlined regulatory approval process  annual prudence reviews and cost recovery mechanisms for preconstruction and financing costs 
state regulatory processes are specific to each jurisdiction 
while we have not made a final determination on nuclear construction  we have taken steps to keep open the option of building a plant or plants 
in  the utilities each filed a col application with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for two additional reactors each at shearon harris nuclear plant harris and at a greenfield site in levy county  florida levy 
during  pef filed and received orders from the fpsc on its levy determination of need and cost recovery petitions 
also  pef filed its site certification for levy  which has an month review period 
in late  pef entered into an engineering  procurement and construction epc agreement for the two proposed levy units 
the next significant step in the levy project is to negotiate joint ownership agreements 
on february   pef received the nrc s schedule for review and approval of the col 
pef is assessing the impact of the nrc schedule on the plans and estimated costs for levy 
current plans would be for the levy units to be operational in the to timeframe 
if pec proceeds with construction at harris  a new unit would not be online until at least see other matters nuclear matters for additional information 
maintaining constructive regulatory relations while confronting new energy realities the utilities successfully resolved key state regulatory issues in  including retail fuel recovery filings in all jurisdictions 
pec successfully sought to terminate its obligation to recognize accelerated amortization of certain environmental compliance costs in north carolina and accelerated depreciation of nuclear generating assets in south carolina 
consequently  pec will not be required to recognize accelerated expenses totaling million in the north carolina jurisdiction and million in the south carolina jurisdiction but will record depreciation over the useful life of the respective assets 
as discussed previously  pef s petitions for the levy needs determination and for million of nuclear cost recovery for the levy and crystal river unit no 
nuclear plant cr projects were granted by the fpsc 
see other matters regulatory environment and note for further information 
the utilities have sought  and will continue to seek  recovery of eligible costs in accordance with the energy policies of their respective jurisdictions 
in february  pef began the process for establishing base rates by filing notification with the fpsc indicating its intent to initiate a base rate proceeding 
this procedural step is required because pef s current base rate agreement will expire at the end of in addition  on february   pef filed a request with the fpsc to decrease customers bills in due to a revised fuel forecast and a deferral of a portion of previously approved nuclear preconstruction charges 
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters see future liquidity and capital resources regulatory matters and recovery of costs and note c 
we are subject to significant federal and state regulations regarding air quality  water quality  control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes  and other environmental matters 
federal judicial actions during vacated mercury emissions regulations and remanded clean air regulations to the united states environmental protection agency epa for modification 
subsequent rule issuances and interpretations  increases in the underlying material  labor and equipment costs  equipment availability  or the unexpected acceleration of compliance dates  among other things  could result in significant increases in our estimated costs to comply and acceleration of some projects 
we currently estimate that total future capital expenditures for the utilities to comply with environmental laws and regulations addressing air and water quality  which are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses  could be in excess of million at pec and million at pef through  which corresponds to the latest emission reduction deadline 
in addition  growing state  federal and international attention to global climate change may result in the regulation of co and other greenhouse gases 
we are preparing for a carbon constrained future and are actively engaged in helping shape effective policies to address the issue 
while state level study groups are busy in all three of our jurisdictions  we continue to believe that this issue requires a national policy framework one that provides certainty and consistency 
reductions in co emissions to the levels specified by some proposals could be materially adverse to our financial position or results of operations if associated costs of control or limitation cannot be recovered from ratepayers 
the cost impact of legislation or regulation to address global climate change would depend on the specific legislation or regulation enacted and cannot be determined at this time 
see other matters environmental matters for additional information 
the american recovery and reinvestment act signed into law in february contains provisions promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy  including billion for smart grid related technologies  billion for energy efficiency and conservation grants and billion in tax credits for the purchase of plug in electric vehicles 
also  the obama administration has announced a goal of sparking a new energy revolution by stimulating transmission and promoting renewable resources while also pricing greenhouse gas emissions and setting a federal requirement for renewable energy 
we are currently reviewing the impact the new legislation might have on our operations 
the impact of the new legislation and regulation resulting from other federal initiatives cannot be determined at this time 
achieving our long term financial objectives and sustaining financial strength and flexibility during anticipated nuclear construction we have several key financial objectives  the first of which is to achieve sustainable earnings growth 
in addition  we seek to continue our track record of dividend growth  as we have increased our dividend for consecutive years  and of the last years 
we will strive to preserve our investment grade credit ratings so that we are positioned to accommodate the significant future demand expected at the utilities 
our ability to meet these financial objectives is largely dependent on the earnings and cash flows of the utilities 
the utilities earnings and operating cash flows are heavily influenced by weather  the economy  demand for electricity related to customer growth  actions of regulatory agencies  cost control  and the timing of recovery of fuel costs and storm damage 
the utilities contributed million of our segment profit and generated substantially all of our consolidated cash flow from operations in partially offsetting the utilities segment profit contribution were losses of million recorded at corporate and other  primarily related to interest expense on holding company debt 
ongoing cost management initiatives have enabled us to offset some of the impact of the slowing economy and high cost pressures 
the utilities are allowed to recover prudently incurred fuel costs through the fuel portion of our rates  which are adjusted annually in each state 
we attempt to mitigate rising fuel prices through our diverse generation mix  staggered fuel contracts and hedging  and supplier and transportation diversity 
mitigating the impact of rising fuel prices benefits our cash flows  interest expense and leverage 
additionally  recovery of higher fuel costs negatively impacts customer satisfaction 
in addition to the significant capital investment required for complying with environmental regulations and meeting anticipated load growth  the utilities operations are inherently capital intensive 
we have addressed the challenges presented by current financial market conditions and will continue to monitor the credit markets to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity 
despite the tightened credit market that began with the extreme market turmoil in the third quarter of  we have been able to issue additional equity and short and long term debt 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we expect total capital expenditures before potential nuclear construction to be approximately billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
if we determine to proceed with the construction of a new nuclear facility  we expect that our potential nuclear construction expenditures will range from million to million in  million to million in and million to million in forecasted potential nuclear construction expenditures are dependent upon  and may vary significantly based upon  the decision to build  regulatory approval schedules  timing and escalation of project costs  and the percentage of joint ownership 
pef has utilized  and anticipates continuing to utilize  nuclear cost recovery mechanisms for nuclear preconstruction and construction cost financing available under florida law 
subject to regulatory approval  capital investments that support load growth and comply with environmental regulations increase the utilities rate base or investment in utility plant  upon which additional return can be realized  and create the basis for long term earnings growth in the utilities 
our now discontinued synthetic fuels operations historically produced significant net earnings driven by tax credits for synthetic fuels production in accordance with the section k tax credit program section k  which expired at the end of however  the associated cash flow benefits are realized over time when deferred section k tax credits generated  but not yet utilized  are ultimately utilized 
at december   the amount of these deferred tax credits carried forward was million 
see other matters synthetic fuels tax credits below and note d for additional information on our synthetic fuels tax credits and other matters 
the progress registrants are subject to various risks 
for a discussion of their current material risks  see item a  risk factors 
results of operations in this section  earnings and the factors affecting earnings are discussed 
the discussion begins with a summarized overview of our consolidated earnings  which is followed by a more detailed discussion and analysis by business segment 
overview for as compared to and as compared to for the year ended december   our net income was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the same period in for the year ended december   our income from continuing operations was million compared to million for the same period in the increase in income from continuing operations as compared to prior year was due primarily to favorable allowance for funds used during construction afudc at the utilities  increased retail base rates at pef  higher wholesale revenues at pef  lower purchased power capacity costs at pec due to the expiration of a power buyback agreement  and favorable net retail customer growth and usage at pec 
partially offsetting these items were higher interest expense at pef  higher income tax expense due to the benefit from the closure of certain federal tax years and positions in  unfavorable net retail customer growth and usage at pef  unfavorable weather at pec  higher investment losses of certain employee benefit trusts at pef and corporate and other resulting from the decline in market conditions  and higher depreciation and amortization expense at pef excluding prior year recoverable storm amortization at pef 
for the year ended december   our net income was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the same period in for the year ended december   our income from continuing operations was million compared to million for the same period in the increase in income from continuing operations as compared to prior year was due primarily to lower north carolina clean smokestacks act clean smokestacks act amortization expense at pec  lower interest expense at the parent due to reducing debt in late  the cost incurred to redeem debt at the parent in  favorable weather at pec  lower allocations of corporate overhead to continuing operations as a result of the divestitures  unrealized losses recorded on contingent value obligations cvos during  favorable afudc equity at the utilities  favorable net retail customer growth and usage at the utilities  and higher wholesale revenues at pef 
partially offsetting these items were higher operation and maintenance o m expenses at the utilities primarily due to higher plant outage and maintenance costs and higher employee benefits  additional depreciation expense associated with pec s accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generation assets see note b  higher interest expense at pef  the impact of the gain on sale of level communications  inc stock acquired as part of the divestiture of progress telecom  llc pt llc  and higher other operating expenses due to disallowed fuel costs at pef 
our segments contributed the following profit or loss from continuing operations in millions change change pec pef total segment profit corporate and other total income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax net income progress energy carolinas pec contributed segment profits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in profits for as compared to is primarily due to lower purchased power capacity costs due to the expiration of a power buyback agreement  favorable afudc and favorable net retail customer growth and usage  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather and lower excess generation revenues 
the increase in profits for as compared to is primarily due to lower clean smokestacks act amortization  the favorable impact of weather and favorable net retail customer growth and usage  partially offset by higher o m expense related to plant outage and maintenance costs and employee benefit costs and additional depreciation expense associated with pec s accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generating assets 
the revenue tables below present the total amount and percentage change of revenues excluding fuel 
revenues excluding fuel and other pass through revenues is defined as total electric revenues less fuel and other pass through revenues 
we and pec consider revenues excluding fuel and other pass through revenues a useful measure to evaluate pec s electric operations because fuel and other pass through revenues primarily represent the recovery of fuel  a portion of purchased power expenses and other pass through expenses through cost recovery clauses and  therefore  do not have a material impact on earnings 
we and pec have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information we provide in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  revenues excluding fuel and other pass through revenues is not defined under gaap  and the presentation may not be comparable to other companies presentation or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report 
revenues pec s electric revenues and the percentage change by year and by customer class were as follows in millions customer class change change residential commercial industrial governmental total retail revenues wholesale unbilled miscellaneous total electric revenues less fuel and other pass through revenues revenues excluding fuel and other pass through revenues pec s revenues  excluding fuel and other pass through revenues of billion and billion for and  respectively  decreased million 
the decrease in revenues was due primarily to lower wholesale revenues  excluding fuel and other pass through revenues  of million and the million unfavorable impact of weather  partially offset by the million favorable impact of net retail customer growth and usage 
the lower wholesale revenues were driven by million lower excess generation sales due to unfavorable market dynamics due to higher relative fuel costs and million lower revenues related to capacity contracts with two major customers 
weather had an unfavorable impact as cooling degree days were percent lower than  even though cooling degree days were comparable to normal 
the favorable net retail customer growth and usage was driven by a net  increase in the average number of customers for compared to  partially offset by lower average usage per retail customer 
the current recession in the united states has contributed to a slowdown in customer growth and usage in pef s service territory see progress energy florida revenues 
pec has not been impacted by the recession as significantly as pef 
however  pec has experienced some decline in the rate of residential and commercial sales growth 
we cannot predict the severity of the recession  how long it may last or the extent to which it may impact pec s revenues 
in the future  pec s customer usage could be impacted by customer response to energy efficiency programs and to increased rates resulting from higher fuel and other recoverable costs 
pec s revenues  excluding fuel and other pass through revenues of billion and billion for and  respectively  increased million 
the increase in revenues was due primarily to the million favorable impact of weather and a million favorable impact of net retail customer growth and usage 
weather had a favorable impact as cooling degree days were percent higher than and percent higher than normal 
the favorable retail customer growth and usage was driven by a net  increase in the average number of customers for compared to  partially offset by lower average usage per retail customer 
pec s electric energy sales in kilowatt hours kwh and the percentage change by year and by customer class were as follows in millions of kwh customer class change change residential commercial industrial governmental total retail energy sales wholesale unbilled total kwh sales retail revenues increased percent for despite a decrease in retail energy sales for the same period primarily due to the impact of increased fuel revenues as a result of higher energy costs and the recovery of prior year fuel costs 
industrial electric energy sales decreased in compared to  primarily due to continued reduction in textile manufacturing in the carolinas as a result of global competition and domestic consolidation  as well as a downturn in the lumber and building materials segment as a result of declines in residential construction 
wholesale revenues decreased less than wholesale energy sales for due to the impact of increased fuel revenues as a result of higher energy costs 
industrial electric energy sales decreased in compared to primarily due to the downward trends in textile manufacturing and residential construction previously discussed 
the increase in industrial revenues for compared to is due to an increase in fuel revenues as a result of higher energy costs and the recovery of prior year fuel costs 
expenses fuel and purchased power fuel and purchased power costs represent the costs of generation  which include fuel purchases for generation  as well as energy purchased in the market to meet customer load 
fuel and a portion of purchased power expenses are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses  and  as such  changes in these expenses do not have a material impact on earnings 
the difference between fuel and purchased power costs incurred and associated fuel revenues that are subject to recovery is deferred for future collection from or refund to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion for  which represents a million increase compared to purchased power expense increased million to million compared to prior year 
the increase is primarily due to increased economical purchases in of million  partially offset by the million impact from the expiration of a power buyback agreement with north carolina eastern municipal power agency power agency 
fuel used in electric generation decreased million to billion primarily due to a million decrease in deferred fuel expense  partially offset by increased current year fuel costs of million 
the decrease in deferred fuel expense was primarily driven by a million impact from the implementation of the north carolina comprehensive energy legislation see other matters regulatory environment and a million impact related to under recovered fuel costs 
deferred fuel expense was higher in primarily due to the collection of fuel costs from customers that had been previously under recovered 
the increase in current year fuel costs of million was primarily due to an increase in coal prices  partially offset by the impacts of lower system requirements and a change in the generation mix 
see pec fuel and purchased power in item  business  for a summary of average fuel costs 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion for  which represents a million increase compared to fuel used in electric generation increased million to billion primarily due to a million increase in fuel costs and a million increase in deferred fuel expense 
fuel costs increased primarily due to a change in generation mix as the percentage of generation supplied by natural gas increased in response to plant outages and higher system requirements driven by favorable weather 
deferred fuel expense increased primarily due to the collection of fuel costs from customers that had been previously under recovered 
purchased power expense decreased million to million compared to the decrease in purchased power is due to lower co generation as a result of contract changes with one of pec s co generators 
operation and maintenance o m expense was billion for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase is driven primarily by a million increase in nuclear expenses  of which million relates to refurbishments  preventative maintenance and incremental outage expenses at brunswick nuclear plant brunswick 
additionally  o m increased due to a million increase in estimated environmental remediation expenses see note a  partially offset by million lower employee benefits as discussed below and million lower nuclear plant outage and maintenance costs primarily due to two nuclear refueling and maintenance outages in the current year compared to three in the prior year 
o m expense was billion for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase is driven primarily by the million higher nuclear plant outage and maintenance costs partially due to three nuclear refueling and maintenance outages in compared to two in and million due to higher employee benefit costs 
the higher employee benefit costs are primarily due to the impact from changes in stock based compensation plans implemented in and higher relative employee incentive goal achievement in compared to depreciation  amortization and accretion depreciation  amortization and accretion expense was million for  which represents a million decrease compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to million lower clean smokestacks act amortization  million lower gridsouth transco  llc gridsouth amortization see note d and million lower storm deferral amortization  partially offset by million higher depreciation associated with the accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generating assets see note b and the million impact of depreciable asset base increases

income tax expense income tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million income tax expense increase in compared to is primarily due to the million impact of higher pre tax income compared to the prior year  million benefit related to the closure of certain federal tax years and positions in the prior year  million due to the accelerated amortization of tax related regulatory assets in accordance with pef s most recent base rate agreement  and million related to the deduction for domestic production activities  partially offset by the million impact of favorable afudc equity discussed above 
afudc equity is excluded from the calculation of income tax expense 
the million income tax expense decrease in compared to is primarily due to the million impact of lower pre tax income  the million impact of tax adjustments and the million impact of favorable afudc equity discussed above 
the tax adjustments are primarily related to the million impact of changes in income tax estimates and the million favorable impact related to the closure of certain federal tax years and positions

progress energy issued million cvos in connection with the acquisition of florida progress corporation florida progress in each cvo represents the right of the holder to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuels facilities purchased by subsidiaries of florida progress in october the payments are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate see note 
at december  and  the cvos had a fair value of million and at december   the cvos had a fair value of million 
progress energy recorded unrealized losses of million and million for and  respectively  to record the changes in fair value of the cvos  which had average unit prices of at december  and and at december  other income tax benefit decreased million for compared to primarily due to the million prior year benefit related to the closure of certain federal tax years and positions see note and the net million impact recorded in for a state net operating loss carry forward 
we previously recorded a deferred tax asset for a state net operating loss carry forward upon the sale of progress energy ventures  inc s pvi nonregulated generation facilities and energy marketing and trading operations 
in  we recorded an additional million deferred tax asset related to the state net operating loss carry forward due to a change in estimate based on tax return filings 
we also evaluated the total state net operating loss carry forward and recorded a partial valuation allowance of million  which more than offset the change in estimate 
other income tax benefit decreased million for compared to primarily due to decreased pre tax expense at the parent primarily as a result of the million impact of the early retirement of debt in  partially offset by the million impact of taxes on interest allocated to discontinued operations  the million impact related to the closure of certain federal tax years and positions see note  the million impact related to the deduction for domestic production activities and the million impact of changes in income tax estimates

for  other expense was million compared to million in the million decrease is primarily due to the million pre tax loss on redemptions of debt at the parent in see note and the million decrease in the allocation of corporate overhead as a result of the divestitures completed during these decreases are partially offset by the million pre tax gain  net of minority interest  on the sale of level communications  inc stock subsequent to the sale of pt llc in see note f and the million increase in interest income on temporary investments due to proceeds from the sale of nonregulated businesses 
discontinued operations over the last several years we have reduced our business risk by exiting substantially all of our nonregulated businesses to focus on the core operations of the utilities 
consequently  the composition of other continuing segments has been impacted by these divestitures 
see note for additional information related to discontinued operations 
terminals operations and synthetic fuels businesses on march   we sold coal terminals and docks in west virginia and kentucky terminals for million in gross cash proceeds 
the coal terminals had a total annual capacity in excess of million tons for transloading  blending and storing coal and other commodities 
proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes 
during the year ended december   we recorded an after tax gain of million on the sale of these assets 
prior to  we had substantial operations associated with the production of coal based solid synthetic fuels 
the production and sale of these products qualified for federal income tax credits so long as certain requirements were satisfied 
as a result of the expiration of the tax credit program  all of our synthetic fuels businesses were abandoned and all operations ceased as of december  all periods have been restated to reflect the abandoned operations of our synthetic fuels businesses as discontinued operations 
terminals and synthetic fuels businesses generated net earnings from discontinued operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net losses from discontinued operations for terminals and synthetic fuels businesses were million for the year ended december  the decrease in net earnings from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   is primarily due to the expiration of the tax credit program 
the change in net loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december   to net earnings from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december   is primarily due to increased tax credits generated due to higher production of coal based solid synthetic fuels  mark to market gain on derivative contracts in and the impairment of synthetic fuels assets recorded in these favorable items are partially offset by an increase in the tax credit reserve due to the increase in production and the change in the relative oil prices  which indicated a higher estimated phase out of tax credits  and lower margins due to the increase in coal based solid synthetic fuels production 
coal mining businesses on march   we sold the remaining operations of progress fuels corporation progress fuels subsidiaries engaged in the coal mining business for gross cash proceeds of million 
proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes 
these assets included powell mountain coal co 
and dulcimer land co  which consisted of approximately  acres in lee county  va  and harlan county  ky 
as a result of the sale  during the year ended december   we recorded an after tax gain of million on the sale of these assets 
on may   we sold certain net assets of three of our coal mining businesses for gross proceeds of million plus a million working capital adjustment 
as a result  during the year ended december   we recorded an after tax loss of million for the sale of these assets 
net losses from discontinued operations for the coal mining business were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cco georgia operations on march   our subsidiary pvi  entered into a series of transactions to sell or assign substantially all of its competitive commercial operations cco physical and commercial assets and liabilities 
assets divested included approximately  mw of gas fired generation assets in georgia 
the sale of the nonregulated generation assets closed on june   for a net sales price of million 
we recorded an estimated after tax loss of million in december based on the terms of the final agreement and post closing adjustments  during the years ended december  and  we incurred an additional million after tax loss and reversed million after tax of the impairment recorded in  respectively 
additionally  on june   pvi closed the transaction involving the assignment of a contract portfolio consisting of full requirements contracts with georgia electric membership cooperatives the georgia contracts  forward gas and power contracts  gas transportation  structured power and other contracts to a third party 
this represented substantially all of our nonregulated energy marketing and trading operations 
as a result of the assignments  pvi made a net cash payment of million  which represented the net cost to assign the georgia contracts and other related contracts 
in the year ended december   we recorded a charge associated with the costs to exit the georgia contracts  and other related contracts  of million after tax 
we used the net proceeds from the divestiture of cco and the georgia contracts for general corporate purposes 
cco s operations generated net losses from discontinued operations of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net losses from discontinued operations in primarily represent the million after tax charge associated with exit costs  partially offset by unrealized mark to market gains related to dedesignated natural gas hedges 
these hedges were dedesignated because management determined that it was no longer probable that the forecasted transactions underlying certain derivative contracts covering approximately billion cubic feet of natural gas would be fulfilled 
therefore  cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued 
net losses from discontinued operations in primarily represent the million pre tax impairment loss million after tax on goodwill recognized in the first quarter of natural gas drilling and production on october   we sold our natural gas drilling and production business gas for approximately billion in net proceeds 
gas included winchester production company  ltd  westchester gas company  texas gas gathering and talco midstream assets ltd  all were subsidiaries of progress fuels 
proceeds from the sale were used primarily to reduce holding company debt and for other corporate purposes 
based on the net proceeds associated with the sale  we recorded an after tax net gain on disposal of million during the year ended december  we recorded an after tax loss of million during the year ended december   primarily related to working capital adjustments 
gas operations generated net earnings from discontinued operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net earnings from discontinued operations during were impacted by increased production  higher market prices and mark to market gains on gas hedges 
cco desoto and rowan generation facilities on may   we entered into definitive agreements to divest of two subsidiaries of pvi  desoto county generating co  llc desoto and rowan county power  llc rowan  including certain existing power supply contracts to southern power company  a subsidiary of southern company  for gross purchase prices of approximately million and million  respectively 
we used the proceeds from the sales to reduce debt and for other corporate purposes 
the sale of desoto closed in the second quarter of and the sale of rowan closed during the third quarter of based on the gross proceeds associated with the sales  we recorded an after tax loss on disposal of million during the year ended december  desoto and rowan operations generated combined net earnings from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  progress telecom  llc on march   we completed the sale of pt llc to level communications  inc we received gross proceeds comprised of cash of million and approximately million shares of level communications  inc common stock valued at an estimated million on the date of the sale 
our net proceeds from the sale of million  after consideration of minority interest  were used to reduce debt 
prior to the sale  we had a percent interest in pt llc 
see note for a discussion of the subsequent sale of the level communications  inc stock in based on the net proceeds associated with the sale and after consideration of minority interest  we recorded an after tax gain on disposal of million during the year ended december  net losses from discontinued operations for pt llc were million for the year ended december  dixie fuels and other fuels business on march   we sold progress fuels percent interest in dixie fuels limited dixie fuels to kirby corporation for million in cash 
dixie fuels operates a fleet of four ocean going dry bulk barge and tugboat units 
dixie fuels primarily transported coal from the lower mississippi river to progress energy s crystal river facility 
we recorded an after tax gain of million on the sale of dixie fuels during the year ended december  during the years ended december  and  we recorded an additional gain of million and million  respectively  primarily related to the expiration of indemnifications 
net earnings from discontinued operations for dixie fuels and other fuels business were million for the year ended december  progress rail we completed the sale of progress rail services corporation during the year ended december  as a result of certain legal  tax and environmental indemnifications provided by progress fuels and progress energy  we continue to record adjustments to the loss on sale 
during the year ended december   we recorded an after tax gain on disposal of million 
during the year ended december   we recorded an after tax loss on disposal of million 
the ultimate resolution of these matters could result in additional adjustments to the loss on sale in future periods 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in doing so  we made certain estimates that were critical in nature to the results of operations 
the following discusses those significant estimates that may have a material impact on our financial results and are subject to the greatest amount of subjectivity 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit and corporate performance committee audit committee of our board of directors 
impact of utility regulation our regulated utilities segments are subject to regulation that sets the prices rates we are permitted to charge customers based on the costs that regulatory agencies determine we are permitted to recover 
at times  regulators permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by a nonregulated company 
this ratemaking process results in deferral of expense recognition and the recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows 
as a result of the different ratemaking processes in each state in which we operate  a significant amount of regulatory assets has been recorded 
we continually review these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
additionally  the state regulatory agencies ratemaking processes often provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of the regulatory assets 
see note for additional information related to the impact of utility regulation on our operations 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist 
if an impairment indicator exists  the asset group held and used is tested for recoverability by comparing the carrying value to the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group 
if the asset group is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows or if the asset group is to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group 
our exposure to potential impairment losses for utility plant  net is mitigated by the fact that our regulated ratemaking process generally allows for recovery of our investment in utility plant plus an allowed return on the investment  as long as the costs are prudently incurred 
the carrying values of our total utility plant  net at december were as follows in millions progress energy pec pef as discussed in note  our financial assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of derivative financial instruments and marketable debt and equity securities held in our nuclear decommissioning trusts 
substantially all unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and all unrealized gains and losses on nuclear decommissioning trust investments are deferred as regulatory liabilities or assets consistent with ratemaking treatment 
therefore  the impact of fair value measurements from recurring financial assets and liabilities on our or the utilities earnings is not significant 
asset retirement obligations as discussed in note d  we account for asset retirement obligations aros  which represent legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain tangible long lived assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
the present values of retirement costs for which we have a legal obligation are recorded as liabilities with an equivalent amount added to the asset cost and depreciated over the useful life of the associated asset 
the liability is then accreted over time by applying an interest method of allocation to the liability 
the adoption of sfas no 
and fin had no impact on the income of the utilities as the effects were offset by the establishment of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
progress energy s  pec s and pef s total aros at december   were billion  billion  and million  respectively 
we calculated the present value of our aros based on estimates which are dependent on subjective factors such as management s estimated retirement costs  the timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount and cost escalation rates 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time and are subject to change 
these changes could materially affect the aros  although changes in such estimates should not affect earnings  because these costs are expected to be recovered through rates 
nuclear decommissioning aros represent percent  percent  and percent respectively  of progress energy s  pec s and pef s total aros at december  to determine nuclear decommissioning aros  we utilize periodic site specific cost studies in order to estimate the nature  cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for our nuclear plants 
our regulators require updated cost estimates for nuclear decommissioning every five years 
these cost studies are subject to change based on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  cost escalation  changes in technology applicable to nuclear decommissioning and changes in federal  state or local regulations 
changes in pec s and pef s nuclear decommissioning site specific cost estimates or the use of alternative cost escalation or discount rates could be material to the nuclear decommissioning liabilities recognized 
pec obtained updated cost studies for its nuclear plants in  using cost factors 
pec plans to update its site specific cost studies in if the site specific cost estimates increased by percent  pec s aros would have increased by million 
if the inflation adjustment increased basis points  pec s aros would have increased by million 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate of basis points would have decreased pec s aros by million 
pef obtained an updated cost study for its nuclear plant in  using cost factors 
if the site specific cost estimates increased by percent  pef s aros would have increased by million 
if the inflation adjustment increased basis points  pef s aros would have increased by million 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate of basis points would have decreased pef s aros by million 
goodwill as discussed in note  we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
for our utility segments  the goodwill impairment tests are performed at the utility operating segment level 
we performed the annual goodwill impairment test for both the pec and pef segments in the second quarters of and  each of which indicated no impairment 
if the fair values for the utility segments were lower by percent  there still would be no impact on the reported value of their goodwill 
the carrying amounts of goodwill at december  and  for reportable segments pec and pef  were billion and billion  respectively 
the amounts assigned to pec and pef are recorded in our corporate and other business segment 
we calculated the fair value of our segments and reporting units by considering various factors  including valuation studies based primarily on a discounted cash flow methodology and published industry valuations and market data as supporting information 
these calculations are dependent on subjective factors such as management s estimate of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time  subsequent changes  particularly changes in management s estimate of future cash flows and the discount rates  interest rates  growth rates or the timing of market equilibrium  could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 
we monitor for events or circumstances that may indicate an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary 
we have considered the distress in the financial markets during and the impact on the fair value of our reporting units and concluded an interim goodwill impairment test was not necessary 
unbilled revenue as discussed in note  we recognize electric utility revenues as service is rendered to customers 
operating revenues included unbilled electric utilities base revenues earned when service has been delivered but not billed by the end of the accounting period 
the determination of electricity sales to individual customers is based on meter readings  which occur on a systematic basis through the month 
at the end of each month  electricity delivered to customers since the last meter reading is estimated and a corresponding accrual for the electric utility revenues associated with unbilled sales is recognized 
unbilled revenues are estimated by applying a weighted average revenue kwh for all customer classes to the number of estimated kwh delivered but not billed 
the calculation of unbilled revenue is affected by factors that include fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period  seasonality  weather  customer usage patterns  price in effect for each customer class and estimated transmission and distribution line losses 
amounts recorded as receivables on the balance sheets at december related to unbilled revenues were as follows in millions progress energy pec pef income taxes judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax related assets and liabilities 
as discussed in note  we account for the effects of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
under sfas no 
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided  representing the future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the probability of realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented  if necessary  to realize deferred tax assets 
we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all  or a portion of  a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty 
ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows and adjustments to tax related assets and liabilities could be material 
in accordance with fin  the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes is accounted for by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
a two step process is required for the application of fin recognition of the tax benefit based on a more likely than not threshold  and measurement of the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
pension costs as discussed in note a  we maintain qualified noncontributory defined benefit retirement pension plans 
we also have supplementary defined benefit pension plans that provide benefits to higher level employees 
our reported costs are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
for example  such costs are impacted by employee demographics  changes made to plan provisions  actual plan asset returns and key actuarial assumptions  such as expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used in determining benefit obligations and annual costs 
due to a slight increase in the market interest rates for high quality aaa aa debt securities  which are used as the benchmark for setting the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future benefit payments  we increased the discount rate to approximately at december   from approximately at december   which will not significantly affect pension costs 
our discount rates are selected based on a plan by plan study  which matches our projected benefit payments to a high quality corporate yield curve 
consistent with general market conditions  our plan assets performed poorly in with returns of approximately 
that negative asset performance will result in increased pension costs in  all other factors remaining constant 
in addition  contributions to pension plan assets in and will result in decreased pension costs in due to increased asset balances  all other factors remaining constant 
evaluations of the effects of these and other factors on our pension costs have not been completed  but we estimate that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be million to million  compared with million recognized in we have pension plan assets with a fair value of approximately billion at december  our expected rate of return on pension plan assets is 
we review this rate on a regular basis 
under sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions sfas no 
 the expected rate of return used in pension cost recognition is a long term rate of return  therefore  we do not adjust that rate of return frequently 
the rate of return represents the lower end of our future expected return range given our asset allocation policy 
a basis point change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pension costs by approximately million 
another factor affecting our pension costs  and sensitivity of the costs to plan asset performance  is the method selected to determine the market related value of assets  ie  the asset value to which the expected long term rate of return is applied 
sfas no 
specifies that entities may use either fair value or an averaging method that recognizes changes in fair value over a period not to exceed five years  with the method selected applied on a consistent basis from year to year 
we have historically used a five year averaging method 
when we acquired florida progress in  we retained the florida progress historical use of fair value to determine market related value for florida progress pension assets 
changes in plan asset performance are reflected in pension costs sooner under the fair value method than the five year averaging method  and  therefore  pension costs tend to be more volatile using the fair value method 
approximately percent of our pension plan assets are subject to each of the two methods 
since pec and pef participate in our pension plans  the general discussion above applies to pec and pef 
pec and pef have not completed evaluating their pension costs 
pec estimates that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be million to million  compared with million recognized in a basis point change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pec s pension costs by approximately million 
pef estimates that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be million to million  compared with a pension credit of million recognized in a basis point change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pef s pension costs by approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources overview our significant cash requirements arise primarily from the capital intensive nature of the utilities operations  including expenditures for environmental compliance 
we rely upon our operating cash flow  substantially all of which is generated by the utilities  commercial paper and bank facilities  and our ability to access the long term debt and equity capital markets for sources of liquidity 
as discussed in future liquidity and capital resources below  synthetic fuels tax credits provide an additional source of liquidity as those credits are realized 
the majority of our operating costs are related to the utilities 
most of these costs are recovered from ratepayers in accordance with various rate plans 
we are allowed to recover certain fuel  purchased power and other costs incurred by pec and pef through their respective recovery clauses 
the types of costs recovered through clauses vary by jurisdiction 
fuel price volatility can lead to over or under recovery of fuel costs  as changes in fuel prices are not immediately reflected in fuel surcharges due to regulatory lag in setting the surcharges 
as a result  fuel price volatility can be both a source of and a use of liquidity resources  depending on what phase of the cycle of price volatility we are experiencing 
changes in the utilities fuel and purchased power costs may affect the timing of cash flows  but not materially affect net income 
as a registered holding company  we are subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for  among other things  the establishment of intercompany extensions of credit utility and non utility money pools 
our subsidiaries participate in internal money pools  operated by progress energy  to more effectively utilize cash resources and reduce outside short term borrowings 
the utility money pool allows the utilities to lend to and borrow from each other 
a non utility money pool allows our nonregulated operations to lend to and borrow from each other 
the parent can lend money to the utility and non utility money pools but cannot borrow funds 
the parent is a holding company and  as such  has no revenue generating operations of its own 
the primary cash needs at the parent level are our common stock dividend  interest and principal payments on the parent s billion of senior unsecured debt and potentially funding the utilities capital expenditures through equity contributions 
the parent s ability to meet these needs is typically funded with dividends from the utilities generated from their earnings and cash flows  and to a lesser extent  dividends from other subsidiaries  repayment of funds due to the parent by its subsidiaries  the parent s bank facility  and or the parent s ability to access the short term and long term debt and equity capital markets 
in recent years  rather than paying dividends to the parent  the utilities  to a large extent  have retained their free cash flow to fund their capital expenditures in lieu of receiving equity contributions from the parent 
although the utilities did not pay dividends to the parent in  pec expects to pay dividends to the parent in there are a number of factors that impact the utilities decision or ability to pay dividends to the parent or to seek equity contributions from the parent  including capital expenditure decisions and the timing of recovery of fuel and other pass through costs 
therefore  we cannot predict the level of dividends that the utilities may pay to the parent from year to year 
we do not currently expect changes to the parent s common stock dividend policy 
cash from operations  commercial paper issuance  borrowings under our credit facilities  long term debt financings  equity offerings  and limited ongoing sales of common stock from our investor plus stock purchase plan  employee benefit and stock option plans are expected to fund capital expenditures and common stock dividends for for the fiscal year  we expect to realize approximately million in the aggregate from the sale of stock through marketed and ongoing equity sales 
we have addressed the challenges presented by current financial market conditions and will continue to monitor the credit markets to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity 
despite the tightened credit market that began with the extreme market turmoil in the third quarter of  we have been able to issue additional equity and short and long term debt 
as shown in the table that follows  we have a number of financial institutions that support our combined billion revolving credit facilities for the parent  pec and pef  thereby limiting our dependence on any one institution 
the credit facilities serve as back ups to our commercial paper programs 
to the extent amounts are reserved for commercial paper or letters of credit outstanding  they are not available for additional borrowings 
at december   the parent had million of outstanding borrowings under its credit facility 
in addition  at december   the parent  pec and pef had outstanding commercial paper balances of million  million and million  respectively  and the parent had issued million of letters of credit  which were supported by the revolving credit agreement rca 
based on these outstanding amounts at december   there was million available for additional borrowings 
during february  the parent repaid million of the outstanding balance under its credit facility

first tennessee bank na total commitment at december   pec and pef had limited counterparty mark to market exposure for financial commodity hedges primarily gas and oil hedges due to spreading our concentration risk over a number of partners 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the exposure in the transaction is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
at december   all of the utilities open financial commodity hedges were in net mark to market liability positions 
see note a for additional information with regard to our commodity derivatives 
at december   we had limited mark to market exposure to certain financial institutions under pay fixed forward starting swaps to hedge cash flow risk with regard to future financing transactions for both the parent and pec 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the exposure in the transaction is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
at december   all of the parent s and pec s open pay fixed forward starting swaps were in a net mark to market liability position 
see note b for additional information with regard to our interest rate derivatives 
our pension trust funds and nuclear decommissioning trust funds are managed by a number of financial institutions  and the assets being managed are diversified in order to limit concentration risk in any one institution or business sector 
we believe our internal and external liquidity resources will be sufficient to fund our current business plans 
risk factors associated with credit facilities and credit ratings are discussed below and in item a  risk factors 
the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis 
historical for as compared to and as compared to cash flows from operations net cash provided by operations is the primary source used to meet operating requirements and a portion of capital expenditures 
the utilities produced substantially all of our consolidated cash from operations for the years ended december   and net cash provided by operating activities for the three years ended december   and  was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities for decreased when compared with the million decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million decrease in the recovery of fuel costs due to the under recovery driven by rising fuel costs  compared to an over recovery of fuel costs during the corresponding period in  million of cash collateral paid to counterparties on derivative contracts in compared to million in net refunds of cash collateral in  primarily at pef  and a million increase in inventory purchases  primarily coal  driven by higher prices 
these impacts were partially offset by a million increase from accounts receivable  primarily related to our divested cco operations and former synthetic fuels businesses  the million payment made in to exit the georgia contracts see note c  a million increase from accounts payable  and a million increase from income taxes  net 
the increase from accounts receivable was primarily driven by the settlement of million of derivative receivables related to derivative contracts for our former synthetic fuels businesses see note a 
the increase from income taxes  net was largely due to million in income tax payments made in related to the sale of gas see note d  partially offset by income tax impacts at pec 
the change in accounts payable was primarily related to our divested operations 
net cash provided by operating activities for decreased when compared with the million decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to million in income tax impacts  largely driven by income tax payments related to the sale of gas  the million payment made to exit the georgia contracts see note c  a million decrease in the recovery of fuel costs  and million in premiums paid for derivative contracts in our synthetic fuels businesses 
these impacts were partially offset by a million decrease in inventory purchases in  primarily related to coal purchases at the utilities  million of working capital changes related to the divestiture of cco  and million in net refunds of cash collateral previously paid to counterparties on derivative contracts in compared to million in net cash payments in at pef 
the decrease in recovery of fuel costs is due to a million decrease at pef driven by the recovery of previously under recovered fuel costs  partially offset by a million increase in the recovery at pec driven by the recovery of previously under recovered fuel costs 
in  and  the utilities filed requests with their respective state commissions seeking rate increases for fuel cost recovery  including amounts for previous under recoveries 
investing activities net cash used provided by investing activities for the three years ended december   and  was billion  billion and million  respectively 
property additions at the utilities  including nuclear fuel  were billion and billion in and  respectively  or approximately percent of consolidated capital expenditures in both and capital expenditures at the utilities are primarily for capacity expansion and normal construction activity and ongoing capital expenditures related to environmental compliance programs 
excluding proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested of million in and million in  cash used in investing activities increased by million 
the increase in was primarily due to a million increase in gross property additions at the utilities  primarily at pef  and a million decrease in net purchases of available for sale securities and other investments 
the increase in capital expenditures for utility property additions at pef was primarily driven by a million increase in environmental compliance expenditures and a million increase in nuclear project expenditures  partially offset by a million decrease related to repowering the bartow plant to more efficient natural gas burning technology and a million decrease related to the hines facility 
available for sale securities and other investments include marketable debt securities and investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts 
excluding proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested of million in and billion in  cash used in investing activities increased by million in as compared to the increase in was primarily due to a million increase in gross property additions at the utilities  primarily at pef  and a million increase in nuclear fuel additions  partially offset by a decrease in property additions at our diversified businesses  most of which have been discontinued or abandoned 
at pec  utility property additions primarily related to an increase in spending for compliance with the clean smokestacks act 
at pef  the increase in utility property additions was primarily due to environmental compliance projects  repowering the bartow plant to more efficient natural gas burning technology  which will not be completed until  and nuclear and transmission projects  partially offset by lower spending on energy system distribution projects and at the hines unit facility

future liquidity and capital resources please review safe harbor for forward looking statements and item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
the utilities produced substantially all of our consolidated cash from operations for the years ended december   and we anticipate that the utilities will continue to produce substantially all of the consolidated cash flows from operations over the next several years 
our discontinued synthetic fuels operations historically produced significant net earnings from the generation of tax credits see other matters synthetic fuels tax credits 
a portion of these tax credits has yet to be realized in cash due to the difference in timing of when tax credits are recognized for financial reporting purposes and realized for tax purposes 
as of december   we have carried forward million of deferred tax credits 
realization of these tax credits is dependent upon our future taxable income  which is expected to be generated primarily by the utilities 
the absence of cash flow from divested businesses is not expected to impact our future liquidity or capital resources as these businesses in the aggregate have been largely cash flow neutral over the last several years 
we expect to be able to meet our future liquidity needs through cash from operations  commercial paper issuance  availability under our credit facilities  long term debt financings and equity offerings 
we may also use periodic ongoing sales of common stock from our investor plus stock purchase plan and employee benefit and stock option plans to meet our liquidity requirements 
we issue commercial paper to meet short term liquidity needs 
as a result of financial and economic conditions in  the short term credit markets tightened  resulting in volatility in commercial paper durations and interest rates 
in november  the parent borrowed million under its rca to reduce rollover risk in the commercial paper markets 
a portion of the rca was repaid with proceeds from the january equity issuance  and we will continue to monitor the commercial paper and short term credit markets to determine when to repay the remaining balance of the rca loan  while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity 
if liquidity conditions deteriorate further and negatively impact the commercial paper market  we will need to evaluate other  potentially more expensive  options for meeting our short term liquidity needs  which may include extending the term and amount of our borrowings under the parent s rca  issuing short term floating rate notes  and or issuing long term debt 
progress energy and its subsidiaries have approximately billion in outstanding long term debt 
currently  approximately million of the utilities debt obligations  approximately million at pec and approximately million at pef  are tax exempt auction rate securities insured by bond insurance 
bond insurance generally allows companies to issue tax exempt bonds with the insurance company s higher credit rating 
ambac assurance corporation ambac insures pec s bonds and syncora guarantee inc  formerly xl capital assurance  inc 
syncora  insures pef s bonds 
auctions for the tax exempt bonds have seen an increase in failures and the relative level of the interest rates that are periodically reset at each auction 
in the event of a failed auction  the bond holders cannot sell their bonds and the interest rate is calculated based on a multiple of a standard market index such as the securities industry and financial markets association s municipal swap index or the london interbank offered rate libor 
the interest rates for most of pec s portfolio of tax exempt securities reset based on the securities industry and financial markets association s municipal swap index 
the interest rates for pef s portfolio of tax exempt securities reset based on one month libor 
the multiple on our auction rate bonds is stable as long as the bonds are rated a or higher by moody s investors service  inc moody s or a or higher by standard poor s rating services s p 
if the insurance company s rating falls below the utilities ratings  then the bonds will be rated at the utilities senior secured debt rating  which is currently a by moody s and a by s p for both utilities 
since the initial downgrades of syncora and ambac in by moody s and s p  which caused an increase in market volatility and an increase in interest rates  subsequent downgrades did not materially impact the reset rates of the tax exempt bonds 
we do not expect further rating actions on syncora and ambac to materially impact the reset rates of the tax exempt securities 
future interest rate resets on our tax exempt auction rate bond portfolio will be dependent on the volatility experienced in the indices that dictate our interest rate resets and or rating agency actions that may move our tax exempt bonds below a a 
we will continue to monitor this market and evaluate options to mitigate our exposure to future volatility 
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our defined benefit pension plans 
although a number of factors impact our pension funding requirements  a decline in the market value of these assets may significantly increase the future funding requirements of the obligations under our defined benefit pension plans 
we expect to make at least million of contributions directly to pension plan assets and million of discretionary contributions directly to the opeb plan assets in see note 
as discussed in strategy  liquidity and capital resources  capital expenditures  and in other matters environmental matters  over the long term  compliance with environmental regulations and meeting the anticipated load growth at the utilities as described under other matters increasing energy demand will require the utilities to make significant capital investments 
these anticipated capital investments are expected to be funded through a combination of cash from operations and issuance of long term debt  preferred stock and common equity  which are dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets 
we may pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks associated with new baseload generation 
as discussed in environmental matters environmental compliance cost estimates  the utilities are continuing construction of in process emission control projects 
on december   pef and the florida department of environmental protection fdep announced an agreement under which pef will retire crystal river units no 
and no 
cr and cr as coal fired units and complete construction of its emission control projects at crystal river units no 
and no 
cr and cr 
cr and cr will be retired after the second proposed levy nuclear unit completes its first fuel cycle  which is anticipated to be around certain of our hedge agreements may result in the receipt of  or posting of  derivative collateral with our counterparties  depending on the daily derivative position 
fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to our return of collateral received and or our posting of collateral with our counterparties negatively impact our liquidity 
substantially all derivative commodity instrument positions are subject to retail regulatory treatment 
after settlement of the derivatives and the fuel is consumed  any realized gains or losses are passed through the fuel cost recovery clause 
due to commodity price changes since december   we have posted additional collateral with counterparties 
at february   we had posted approximately million of cash collateral compared to million of cash collateral posted at december  the majority of our financial hedge agreements will settle in and additional commodity market price decreases could result in significant increases in the derivative collateral that we are required to post with counterparties 
we continually monitor our derivative positions in relation to market price activity 
the amount and timing of future sales of securities will depend on market conditions  operating cash flow and our specific needs 
we may from time to time sell securities beyond the amount immediately needed to meet capital requirements in order to allow for the early redemption of long term debt  the redemption of preferred stock  the reduction of short term debt or for other corporate purposes 
regulatory matters and recovery of costs regulatory matters  as discussed in other matters regulatory environment and note  and filings for recovery of environmental costs  as discussed in note and in other matters environmental matters  may impact our future liquidity and financing activities 
the impacts of these matters  including the timing of recoveries from ratepayers  can be both a source of and a use of future liquidity resources 
regulatory developments expected to have a material impact on our liquidity are discussed below 
as discussed further in note and in other matters regulatory environment  the florida legislature passed comprehensive energy legislation that became law in and the south carolina and north carolina state legislatures passed energy legislation that became law in these laws may impact our liquidity over the long term 
we cannot predict the impacts to our liquidity of complying with florida s comprehensive energy legislation 
among other provisions  the north carolina and south carolina state energy laws provide mechanisms for recovery of certain baseload generation construction costs and expand annual fuel clause mechanisms so that additional costs may be recovered annually 
on february   the north carolina utilities commission ncuc issued an order adopting final rules for implementing north carolina s comprehensive energy legislation 
rates for the dsm and energy efficiency clause and the north carolina renewable energy and energy efficiency portfolio standard nc reps clause will be set based on projected costs with true up provisions 
pec cost recovery clause on june   the south carolina public service commission scpsc approved pec s request for an increase in the fuel rate charged to its south carolina ratepayers  which provided for a million increase in fuel rates for under recovered fuel costs associated with prior year settlements and to meet future expected fuel costs 
residential electric bills increased by per  kwh  or percent  for fuel cost recovery effective july  at december   pec s south carolina deferred fuel balance was million 
on november   the ncuc approved a settlement agreement between pec  the carolina industrial group for fair utility rates ii cigfur  carolina utility customers association cuca and the ncuc public staff 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  pec will collect million of deferred fuel costs ratably over a three year period beginning december   compared with a one year recovery period proposed in pec s original request 
amounts to be collected in years beginning december  and  will bear interest at a rate equal to the five year united states treasury note plus basis points 
effective december   residential electric bills increased by per  kwh  or percent 
at december   pec s north carolina deferred fuel balance was million  of which million is expected to be collected after and has been classified as a long term regulatory asset 
pec has begun implementing the requirements of north carolina s comprehensive energy legislation passed in  including a series of dsm and energy efficiency programs and nc reps requirements 
program costs are eligible for recovery and have been deferred 
the majority of the programs has been approved by the ncuc or is pending further review 
we cannot predict the outcome of the filings pending further approval by the ncuc or whether the programs will produce the expected operational and economic results 
pef base rates as a result of a base rate proceeding in  pef is party to a base rate settlement agreement that was effective with the first billing cycle of january and will remain in effect through the last billing cycle of december  with pef having sole option to extend the agreement through the last billing cycle of june pursuant to the agreement 
in accordance with the base rate agreement and as modified by a stipulation and settlement agreement approved by the fpsc on october   base rates were adjusted in january due to specified generation facilities placed in service in on february   in anticipation of the expiration of its current base rate settlement agreement  pef notified the fpsc that it intends to request an increase in its base rates  effective january  in its notice  pef requested the fpsc to approve calendar year as the projected test period for setting new base rates and stated that it intends to seek annual rate relief between million to million 
pef intends to file its case in chief on march  the request for increased base rates is based  in part  on investments pef is making in its generating fleet and in its transmission and distribution systems 
if approved by the fpsc  the new base rates would increase residential bills by approximately per  kwh  or percent  effective january  we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
as part of its february  notification  pef also informed the fpsc that it may seek additional rate relief in  primarily driven by the addition of its repowered bartow power plant  which is expected to begin commercial operation in june and decreased sales and higher pension costs impacted by the current financial and credit crises 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
pef cause recovery clause on july   the fpsc approved recovery of pef s million projected year end under recovery of fuel costs  but allowed pef to recover percent in and percent in therefore  the increase in the fuel rate for the period august through december was per  kwh 
this increase was partially offset by the expiration of pef s storm cost recovery surcharge of per  kwh effective august consequently  beginning with the first billing cycle in august and including gross receipts tax  residential electric bills increased by per  kwh  or percent 
in november  the fpsc approved pef s request for an increase in residential electric bills of per  kwh  or percent  effective january  the increase in residential bills is primarily due to increases of per  kwh for the projected recovery of fuel costs  per  kwh for the projected recovery through the capacity cost recovery clause and per  kwh for the projected recovery through the ecrc 
the increase in the capacity cost recovery clause is primarily the result of projected costs to be incurred in under the nuclear cost recovery rule discussed below for the proposed levy units and and the cr uprate less the projected reduction in capacity costs 
the increase in the ecrc is primarily due to the recovery of emission allowance costs see note b and the return on assets expected to be placed in service in on february   pef filed a request with the fpsc to reduce its fuel cost recovery factors by an amount sufficient to achieve a million reduction in fuel charges to retail customers as a result of effective fuel purchasing strategies and lower fuel prices  and to defer until the recovery of million of levy nuclear preconstruction costs  which the fpsc had authorized to be collected in as discussed below in nuclear cost recovery 
if approved  the request would reduce residential customers fuel charges by per  kwh  and would reduce the nuclear cost recovery charge by per  kwh  starting with the first april billing cycle 
commercial and industrial customers would see similar reductions 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
on october   the fpsc issued an order requiring pef to refund its ratepayers approximately million  including interest  over a month period beginning january  the refund was returned to the ratepayers through a reduction of prior year under recovered fuel costs 
the fpsc also ordered pef to address whether it was prudent in its and coal purchases for cr and cr a hearing on pef s and coal purchases has been scheduled for april  on february   florida s office of public counsel opc filed direct testimony in this hearing alleging that during and  pef collected excessive fuel costs and sulfur dioxide so allowance costs of million before interest 
the opc claimed that these excessive costs were attributed to pef s ongoing practice of not blending the most economic sources of coal at its cr and cr plants 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
pef has received approval from the fpsc for recovery through the ecrc of the majority of costs associated with the remediation of distribution and substation transformers  which were estimated to be million at december  the fpsc has approved cost recovery of pef s prudently incurred costs necessary to achieve its integrated strategy to address compliance with the clean air interstate rule cair  the clean air mercury rule camr and the clean air visibility rule cavr through the ecrc see other matters environmental matters for discussion regarding the cair  camr and cavr 
nuclear cost recovery pef is allowed to recover prudently incurred site selection costs  preconstruction costs and the carrying cost on construction cost balances on an annual basis through the capacity cost recovery clause 
such amounts will not be included in pef s rate base when the plant is placed in commercial operation 
the nuclear cost recovery rule also has a provision to recover costs should the project be abandoned after the utility receives a final order granting a determination of need 
these costs include any unrecovered construction work in progress at the time of abandonment and any other prudent and reasonable exit costs 
in addition  the rule requires the fpsc to conduct an annual prudence review of the reasonableness and prudence of all such costs  including construction costs  and such determination shall not be subject to later review except upon a finding of fraud  intentional misrepresentation or the intentional withholding of key information by the utility 
during  pef filed for recovery of costs incurred to uprate cr under florida s comprehensive energy legislation and the fpsc s nuclear cost recovery rule 
the current project estimate of fully loaded costs for the multi stage uprate is million 
on august   the fpsc granted pef s petition to amend its request to recover costs for the nuclear uprate project under the nuclear cost recovery rule 
as discussed further in note and other matters nuclear  on august   the fpsc issued the final order granting pef s need certification petition for its proposed levy units and  together with the associated facilities  including transmission lines and substation facilities 
the filed  nonbinding project cost estimate for levy units and is approximately billion for generating facilities and approximately billion for associated transmission facilities 
on october   the fpsc voted to approve the inclusion of preconstruction and carrying charges of million as well as site selection costs of million in establishing pef s capacity cost recovery clause factor 
as discussed above in pef cost recovery clause  on february   pef filed a request with the fpsc to defer the recovery of million of levy nuclear preconstruction costs 
capital expenditures total cash from operations and proceeds from long term debt issuances provided the funding for our capital expenditures  including environmental compliance and other utility property additions  nuclear fuel expenditures and non utility property additions during as shown in the table that follows  we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to be incurred at our regulated operations 
we expect to fund our capital requirements primarily through a combination of internally generated funds  long term debt  preferred stock and or common equity 
in addition  we have billion in credit facilities that support the issuance of commercial paper

the following table reflects progress energy s contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december   in the respective periods in which they are due in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt a see note interest payments on long term debt b capital lease obligations c see note b operating leases c see note b fuel and purchased power d see note a other purchase obligations e see note a minimum pension funding requirements f other postretirement benefits g see note a uncertain tax positions h see note other commitments i total a our maturing debt obligations are generally expected to be repaid with cash from operations or refinanced with new debt issuances in the capital markets 
b interest payments on long term debt are based on the interest rate effective at december  c amounts include certain related executory cost commitments 
d fuel and purchased power commitments represent the majority of our remaining future commitments after debt obligations 
essentially all of our fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through cost recovery clauses in accordance with north carolina  south carolina and florida regulations and therefore do not require separate liquidity support 
e amounts primarily relate to an epc agreement that pef entered into in december for two nuclear units planned for construction at levy 
actual payments under the epc agreement are dependent upon  and may vary significantly based upon  the decision to build  regulatory approval schedules  timing and escalation of project costs  and the percentages  if any  of joint ownership 
f represents the projected minimum required contributions to the qualified pension trusts for a total of years 
these amounts are subject to change significantly based on factors such as pension asset earnings and market interest rates 
g represents projected benefit payments for a total of years related to our postretirement health and life plans 
these amounts are subject to change based on factors such as experienced claims and general health care cost trends 
h uncertain tax positions of million are not reflected in this table as we cannot predict when open income tax years will be closed with completed examinations 
we are not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the month period ending december  i by ncuc order  in  pec began transitioning north carolina jurisdictional amounts currently retained internally to its external decommissioning funds 
the transition of the original million must be complete by december   and at least percent must be transitioned each year 
other matters synthetic fuels tax credits prior to  we had substantial operations associated with the production of coal based solid synthetic fuels as defined under section of the internal revenue code the code section and as redesignated effective as section k of the code section k as discussed below 
the production and sale of these products qualified for federal income tax credits so long as certain requirements were satisfied 
qualifying synthetic fuels facilities entitled their owners to federal income tax credits based on the barrel of oil equivalent of the synthetic fuels produced and sold by these plants 
the tax credits associated with synthetic fuels in a particular year were phased out when annual average market prices for crude oil exceeded certain prices 
the synthetic fuels tax credit program expired at the end of because we abandoned our majority owned facilities and our other synthetic fuels operations ceased in late december  we reclassified the operations of our synthetic fuels businesses as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of legislation enacted in redesignated the section tax credit as a general business credit under section k of the code effective january  the previous amount of section tax credits that we were allowed to claim in any calendar year through december   was limited by the amount of our regular federal income tax liability 
section tax credit amounts allowed but not utilized are carried forward indefinitely as deferred alternative minimum tax credits 
the redesignation of section tax credits as a section k general business credit removed the regular federal income tax liability limit on synthetic fuels production and subjects the credits to a one year carry back period and a year carry forward period 
section provided that if the average wellhead price per barrel for unregulated domestic crude oil for the year annual average price exceeded a certain threshold value the threshold price  the amount of section k tax credits were reduced for that year 
also  if the annual average price exceeded the price per barrel of unregulated domestic crude oil at which the value of section k tax credits were fully eliminated phase out price  the section k tax credits were eliminated for that year 
the threshold price and the phase out price were adjusted annually for inflation 
when the annual average price fell between the threshold price and the phase out price for a year  the amount by which section k tax credits were reduced depended on where the annual average price fell in that continuum 
the department of the treasury calculated the annual average price based on the domestic crude oil first purchases prices published by the energy information agency 
based on the respective annual average price  our synthetic fuels tax credits generated during and were reduced by percent and percent  or approximately million and million  respectively 
total section k credits generated under the synthetic fuels tax credit program including those generated by florida progress prior to our acquisition  were billion  of which billion has been used to offset regular federal income tax liability and million is being carried forward as deferred tax credits 
see note d and item a  risk factors  for additional discussion related to our synthetic fuels operations 
regulatory environment the utilities operations in north carolina  south carolina and florida are regulated by the ncuc  the scpsc and the fpsc  respectively 
the utilities are also subject to regulation by the ferc  the nuclear regulatory commission nrc and other federal and state agencies common to the utility business 
as a result of regulation  many of the fundamental business decisions  as well as the rate of return the utilities are permitted to earn  are subject to the approval of one or more of these governmental agencies 
to our knowledge  there is currently no enacted or proposed legislation in north carolina  south carolina or florida that would give retail ratepayers the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry 
we cannot anticipate when  or if  any of these states will move to increase retail competition in the electric industry 
the retail rate matters affected by state regulatory authorities are discussed in detail in notes b and c 
this discussion identifies specific retail rate matters  the status of the issues and the associated effects on our consolidated financial statements 
during the session  the florida legislature passed comprehensive energy legislation  which became law on june  the legislation includes provisions that would  among other things  help enhance the ability to cost effectively site transmission lines  require the fpsc to develop a renewable portfolio standard that the fpsc would present to the legislature for ratification in  direct the fdep to develop rules establishing a cap and trade program to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that the fdep would present to the legislature no earlier than january for ratification by the legislature  establish a new florida energy and climate commission as the principal governmental body to develop energy and climate policy for the state and to make recommendations to the governor and legislature on energy and climate issues  and require the fpsc to analyze utility revenue decoupling and provide a report and recommendation to the governor and legislature by january  the fpsc concluded and recommended to the governor and legislature that no specific revenue decoupling program needs to be  or should be  implemented at this time 
in complying with the provisions of the law  pef would be able to recover its reasonable prudent compliance costs 
however  until the rulemaking processes are completed  we cannot predict the costs of complying with the law 
on july   the governor of florida issued executive orders to address reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
the executive orders call for the first southeastern state cap and trade program and include adoption of a maximum allowable emissions level of greenhouse gases for florida utilities 
the standard will require  at a minimum  the following three reduction milestones by  emissions not greater than year utility sector emissions  by  emissions not greater than year utility sector emissions  and by  emissions not greater than percent of year utility sector emissions 
the energy and climate action team appointed by the governor developed recommendations through a stakeholder process and submitted its final report to the governor on october  the report s recommendations encourage the consideration of a cap and trade approach to reduce the state s greenhouse emissions and the development and implementation of energy efficiency and conservation measures  a climate registry and a renewable portfolio standard florida rps of percent by the fdep s first workshop on the greenhouse gas cap and trade rulemaking was held december  the rulemaking is expected to continue through  and the rule requires legislative ratification before implementation 
the executive orders also requested that the fpsc initiate a rulemaking by september   that would require florida utilities to produce at least percent of their electricity from renewable sources  reduce the cost of connecting solar and other renewable energy technologies to florida s power grid by adopting uniform statewide interconnection standards for all utilities  and authorize a uniform  statewide method to enable residential and commercial customers  who generate electricity from on site renewable technologies of up to mw in capacity  to offset their consumption over a billing period by allowing their electric meters to turn backward when they generate electricity net metering 
the fpsc has held meetings regarding the renewable portfolio standard  and the fpsc staff drafted a florida rps that would require that percent of electricity produced in the state come from renewable resources by on january   the fpsc approved a draft florida rps rule with a goal of percent renewable energy production by the fpsc provided the draft florida rps rule to the florida legislature in february the legislature will review  ratify as is  make revisions  or decide not to have a florida rps rule at all 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
we cannot predict the costs of complying with the laws and regulations that may ultimately result from these executive orders 
our balanced solution  as described in increasing energy demand  includes greater investment in energy efficiency  renewable energy and state of the art generation and demonstrates our commitment to environmental responsibility 
pef has agreed that cr and cr will cease to be operated as coal fired units by december  this date assumes timely licensing  construction and commencement of commercial operation of pef s proposed new levy units and the retirement of cr and cr as coal fired units is contingent upon completion of the first fuel cycle for levy unit pef shall advise the fdep of any developments that would delay the retirement of cr and cr beyond the completion of the first fuel cycle for levy unit during  the north carolina legislature passed comprehensive energy legislation  which became law on august  the law includes provisions for nc reps  expansion of the definition of the traditional fuel clause and recovery of the costs of new dsm and energy efficiency programs through an annual dsm clause 
on february   the ncuc issued an order adopting final rules for implementing north carolina s comprehensive energy legislation 
these rules provide filing requirements associated with the legislation 
the order required pec to submit its first annual nc reps compliance plan as part of its integrated resource plan  which was filed on september  under the new rules  beginning in  pec will also be required to file an annual nc reps compliance report demonstrating the actions it has taken to comply with the nc reps requirement 
the rules measure compliance with the nc reps requirement via renewable energy certificates rec earned after january  the ncuc will pursue a third party rec tracking system  but will not develop or require participation in a rec trading platform at this time 
the order also establishes a schedule and filing requirements for dsm and energy efficiency cost recovery and financial incentives 
rates for the dsm and energy efficiency clause and the nc reps clause will be set based on projected costs with true up provisions 
in  pec filed for ncuc approval of multiple dsm and energy efficiency programs 
the majority of the programs has been approved by the ncuc or is pending further review 
we cannot predict the outcome of the dsm and energy efficiency filings pending further approval by the ncuc or whether the programs will produce the expected operational and economic results 
legal we are subject to federal  state and local legislation and court orders 
the specific issues  the status of the issues  accruals associated with issue resolutions and our associated exposures are discussed in detail in note d 
increasing energy demand meeting the anticipated long term growth within the utilities service territories will require a balanced approach 
the three main elements of this balanced solution are expanding our energy efficiency programs  investing in the development of alternative energy resources for the future  and operating state of the art plants that produce energy cleanly and efficiently by modernizing existing plants and pursuing options for building new plants and associated transmission facilities 
we are actively pursuing expansion of our dsm  energy efficiency and conservation programs as energy efficiency is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy costs  offset the need for new power plants and protect the environment 
dsm programs include  but are not limited to  any program or initiative that shifts the timing of electricity use from peak to nonpeak periods and includes load management  electricity system and operating controls  direct load control  interruptible load  and electric system equipment and operating controls 
our energy efficiency program provides simple  low cost options for residential customers to reduce energy use  promotes home energy checks  provides tools and programs for large and small businesses to minimize their energy use and provides an interactive internet web site with online calculators  programs and efficiency tips 
we are actively engaged in a variety of alternative energy projects  including producing electricity from swine waste and other plant or animal sources  solar  hydrogen  biomass and landfill gas technologies 
we are evaluating the feasibility of producing electricity from these and other sources 
in the coming years  we will continue to invest in existing plants and consider plans for building new generating plants 
due to the anticipated long term growth in our service territories  we estimate that we will require new generation facilities in both florida and the carolinas toward the end of the next decade  and we are evaluating the best available options for this generation  including advanced design nuclear and gas technologies 
at this time  no definitive decisions have been made to construct new nuclear plants 
in  pec announced a two year moratorium on constructing new coal fired plants while pursuing expansion of energy efficiency and conservation programs 
if pec proceeds with construction of a new nuclear plant  the new plant would not be online until at least see nuclear below 
as authorized under the energy policy act of epact  on october   the united states department of energy doe published final regulations for the disbursement of up to billion in loan guarantees for clean energy projects using innovative technologies 
the guarantees  which will cover up to percent of the amount of any loan for no more than percent of the project cost  are expected to spur development of nuclear  clean coal and ethanol projects 
in  congress authorized billion in loan guarantee authority for innovative energy projects 
of the total provided  billion is set aside for nuclear power facilities  billion for advanced nuclear facilities for the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle  billion for renewable and or energy efficient systems and manufacturing and distributed energy generation transmission and distribution  billion for coal based power generation and industrial gasification at retrofitted and new facilities that incorporate carbon capture and sequestration or other beneficial uses of carbon  and billion for advanced coal gasification 
in june  the doe announced solicitations for a total of up to billion of the amount authorized by congress in federal loan guarantees for projects that employ advanced energy technologies that avoid  reduce or sequester air pollutants or greenhouse gas emissions and advanced nuclear facilities for the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle 
pef submitted part i of the application for federal loan guarantees for nuclear power facilities on september   for levy 
pef was one of applicants that submitted part i of the application 
part ii of the application was due on december  pef decided not to pursue the loan guarantee program at this time 
the program requires that the guarantee be in a first lien position on all assets of the project  which conflicts with pef s current mortgage 
obtaining the required approval to amend the current mortgage from percent of current bondholders would be unlikely  and current secured debt of billion would need to be refinanced with unsecured debt to meet the requirements of the guarantee 
in addition  the costs associated with obtaining the loan guarantee remain unclear at this time 
however  this decision does not preclude pef from revisiting the program at a later date if there are changes to the program 
we cannot predict if pef will pursue this program further 
a new nuclear plant may be eligible for the federal production tax credits and risk insurance provided by epact 
epact provides an annual tax credit of cents per kwh for nuclear facilities for the first eight years of operation 
the credit is limited to the first  mw of new nuclear generation in the united states and has an annual cap of million per  mw of national mw capacity limitation allocated to the unit 
in april  the internal revenue service irs provided interim guidance that the  mw of production tax credits generally will be allocated to new nuclear facilities that file license applications with the nrc by december   had poured safety related concrete prior to january   and were placed in service before january  there is no guarantee that the interim guidance will be incorporated into the final regulations governing the allocation of production tax credits 
multiple utilities have announced plans to pursue new nuclear plants 
there is no guarantee that any nuclear plant we construct would qualify for these or other incentives 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
nuclear nuclear generating units are regulated by the nrc 
in the event of noncompliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines  set license conditions  shut down a nuclear unit or take some combination of these actions  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
our nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages  repairs  uprates and certain other modifications 
on december   harris received a year extension from the nrc on its operating license  which extends the operating license through the nrc operating license held by pef for cr currently expires in december on december   pef filed an application for a year extension from the nrc on the operating license for cr  which would extend the operating license through  if approved 
pef anticipates a decision from the nrc in potential new construction while we have not made a final determination on nuclear construction  we have taken steps to keep open the option of building a plant or plants 
during  pec and pef filed col applications to potentially construct new nuclear plants in north carolina and florida 
the nrc estimates that it will take approximately three to four years to review and process the col applications 
on january   we announced that pec selected a site at harris to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
we selected the westinghouse electric ap reactor design as the technology upon which to base pec s application submission 
on february   pec filed its col application with the nrc for two additional reactors at harris 
on april   the nrc docketed  or accepted for review  the harris application 
docketing the application does not preclude additional requests for information as the review proceeds  nor does it indicate whether the nrc will issue the license 
on june   the nrc published the petition for leave to intervene 
petitions to intervene may be filed within days of the notice by anyone whose interest may be affected by the proposed license and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding 
one petition to intervene was filed with the nrc within the day notice period 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
if we receive approval from the nrc and applicable state agencies  and if the decisions to build are made  a new plant would not be online until at least see increasing energy demand above 
on december   we announced that pef selected a greenfield site at levy to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
we selected the westinghouse electric ap reactor design as the technology upon which to base pef s application submission 
in  pef completed the purchase of approximately  acres for levy and associated transmission needs 
on july   pef filed its col application with the nrc for two reactors 
the fpsc issued the final order granting pef s petition for the determination of need for levy on august  if we receive timely approval from the nrc and applicable state agencies  and if the decisions to build are made  safety related construction activities could begin as early as  and a new plant could be operational in the to timeframe see increasing energy demand above 
on october   the nrc docketed  or accepted for review  the levy nuclear project application 
docketing the application does not preclude additional requests for information as the review proceeds  nor does it indicate whether the nrc will issue the license 
on december   the nrc published the petition for leave to intervene 
petitions to intervene may be filed within days of the notice by anyone whose interest may be affected by the proposed license and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding

we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
in  both the levy county planning commission and the board of commissioners voted unanimously in favor of pef s requests to change the comprehensive land use plan 
on may   the florida department of community affairs fdca issued its final determination that the amendments to the levy county comprehensive plan are in compliance with land use regulations 
in addition  pef filed its application for site certification with the fdep on june  a decision on pef s fdep site certification application is expected in on january   the fdep filed a favorable staff analysis report in advance of site certification hearings set to commence on february  in accordance with provisions of florida s energy legislation enacted in  the fpsc ordered new rules in december that would allow investor owned utilities such as pef to request recovery of certain planning and construction costs of a nuclear power plant prior to commercial operation 
the fpsc issued a final rule on february   under which utilities will be allowed to recover prudently incurred site selection costs  preconstruction costs and the carrying cost on construction cost balance on an annual basis through the capacity cost recovery clause 
such amounts will not be included in a utility s rate base when the plant is placed in commercial operation 
the nuclear cost recovery rule also has a provision to recover costs should the project be abandoned after the utility receives a final order granting a determination of need 
these costs include any unrecovered construction work in progress at the time of abandonment and any other prudent and reasonable exit costs 
in addition  the rule will require the fpsc to conduct an annual prudence review of the reasonableness and prudence of all such costs  including construction costs  and such determination shall not be subject to later review except upon a finding of fraud  intentional misrepresentation or the intentional withholding of key information by the utility 
also  on february   the fpsc amended its power plant bid rules to  among other things  exempt nuclear power plants from existing bid requirements 
on march   pef also filed a petition with the fpsc to open a discovery docket regarding the actual and projected costs of the proposed levy nuclear project 
pef filed the petition to assist the fpsc in the timely and adequate review of the projects costs recoverable under the fpsc nuclear cost recovery rule 
on may   pef filed a petition for recovery of both preconstruction and carrying charges on construction costs incurred or anticipated to be incurred during and under the nuclear cost recovery rule 
based on the affirmative vote by the fpsc on the determination of need for the levy nuclear project  pef filed a petition on july   to recover all prudently incurred costs under the fpsc nuclear cost recovery rule 
on november   the fpsc issued an order to approve the inclusion of preconstruction and carrying charges of million as well as site selection costs of million in establishing pef s capacity cost recovery clause factor 
pef will be a participant in the annual nuclear cost recovery proceeding  which was opened by the fpsc on january  the proceeding will occur throughout the year with an order expected by the end of pef signed an epc agreement on december   with westinghouse electric company llc and stone webster  inc for two westinghouse ap nuclear units to be constructed at levy 
more than half of the approximate billion contract price is fixed or firm with agreed upon escalation factors 
the total cost for the two generating units is estimated to be approximately billion 
this total cost estimate includes land  plant components  financing costs  construction  labor  regulatory fees and the initial core for the two units 
an additional billion is estimated for the necessary transmission equipment and approximately miles of transmission lines associated with the project 
the final cost of the project will depend on the completion dates  which will be determined in large part by the nrc review schedule 
on february   pef received the nrc s schedule for review and approval of the col 
pef is assessing the impact of the nrc schedule on the plans and estimated costs for levy 
the epc agreement includes various incentives  warranties  performance guarantees  liquidated damage provisions and parent guarantees designed to incent the contractor to perform efficiently 
in  pef made payments toward long lead equipment and engineering related to the epc agreement 
for termination without cause  the epc agreement contains exit provisions with termination fees  which may be significant  that vary based on the termination circumstances 
in  the south carolina legislature ratified new energy legislation  which includes provisions for cost recovery mechanisms associated with nuclear baseload generation 
in  the north carolina legislature also passed new energy legislation  which authorizes the ncuc to allow annual prudence reviews of baseload generating plant construction costs and removes the requirement that a public utility prove financial distress before it may include construction work in progress in rate base and adjust rates  accordingly  in a general rate case while a baseload generating plant is under construction see other matters regulatory environment 
spent nuclear fuel matters in july  congress passed an override resolution to nevada s veto of the doe s proposal to locate a permanent underground nuclear waste storage facility at yucca mountain  nev 
in january  the state of nevada  clark county  nev  and the city of las vegas petitioned the us court of appeals for the district of columbia us court of appeals for review of the congressional override resolution 
these same parties also challenged the epa s radiation standards for yucca mountain 
on july   the court rejected the challenge to the constitutionality of the resolution approving yucca mountain  but ruled that the epa was wrong to set a  year compliance period in the radiation protection standard 
on september   the epa issued final rules for limiting radiation exposure at yucca mountain 
the epa retained the dose limit of millirem per year for the first  years and established a dose limit of millirem for annual exposure per year between  years and million years 
in february  the nrc approved a final rule for the waste repository at yucca mountain incorporating these radiation protection standards 
on october   the state of nevada again filed suit with the dc court of appeals challenging the epa standard 
on october   the doe certified the regulatory compliance of the document database that will be used by all parties involved in the federal licensing process for the yucca mountain facility 
the nrc did not uphold the doe s prior certification in in response to challenges from the state of nevada 
the state again is expected to challenge the doe s certification process 
the doe has stated that the earliest date the repository may be able to start accepting spent nuclear fuel is the utilities cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
the doe submitted the license application for the proposed high level nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain in june the nrc formally docketed the license application in september  which begins the formal licensing phase that is anticipated to take three to four years 
the state of nevada and other interested parties are expected to intervene in the licensing proceedings 
on august   the doe announced that its estimated cost to build and commence operations at the yucca mountain facility has increased from billion to billion due to an increase in material costs  an increase in the quantity of spent fuel to store and a refinement of the repository s design 
on october   the nrc proposed revisions to its waste confidence findings that would remove the provisions stating that the nrc s confidence in waste management  underlying the licensing of reactors  is based in part on a repository being in operation by instead  the nrc states that repository capacity will be available within to years beyond the licensed operation of all reactors  and that used fuel generated in any reactor can be safely stored on site without significant environmental impact for at least years beyond the licensed operation of the reactor 
with certain modifications and additional approvals by the nrc  including the installation of on site dry cask storage facilities at pec s robinson nuclear plant robinson  brunswick and cr  the utilities spent nuclear fuel storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space for spent fuel generated by their respective systems through the expiration of the operating licenses  including any license extensions  for their nuclear generating units 
harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its extended operating license 
see note d for information about the complaint filed by the utilities in the united states court of federal claims against the doe for its failure to fulfill its contractual obligation to receive spent fuel from nuclear plants 
failure to open the yucca mountain or other facility would leave the doe open to further claims by utilities 
environmental matters we are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities in the areas of air quality  water quality  control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes  and other environmental matters 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to our business and operations and believe we have all necessary permits to conduct such operations 
hazardous and solid waste management the provisions of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  authorize the epa to require the cleanup of hazardous waste sites 
this statute imposes retroactive joint and several liabilities 
some states  including north carolina  south carolina and florida  have similar types of statutes 
we are periodically notified by regulators  including the epa and various state agencies  of our involvement or potential involvement in sites that may require investigation and or remediation 
there are presently several sites with respect to which we have been notified of our potential liability by the epa  the state of north carolina  the state of florida or potentially responsible parties prp groups 
various organic materials associated with the production of manufactured gas  generally referred to as coal tar  are regulated under federal and state laws 
pec and pef are each prps at several manufactured gas plant mgp sites 
we are also currently in the process of assessing potential costs and exposures at other sites 
these costs are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses see notes and 
both pec and pef evaluate potential claims against other prps and insurance carriers and plan to submit claims for cost recovery where appropriate 
the outcome of potential and pending claims cannot be predicted 
hazardous and solid waste management matters are discussed in detail in note a 
we accrue costs to the extent our liability is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 
because the extent of environmental impact  allocation among prps for all sites  remediation alternatives which could involve either minimal or significant efforts  and concurrence of the regulatory authorities have not yet reached the stage where a reasonable estimate of the remediation costs can be made  we cannot determine the total costs that may be incurred in connection with the remediation of all sites at this time 
it is probable that current estimates could change and additional losses  which could be material  may be incurred in the future 
air quality and water quality we are  or may ultimately be  subject to various current and proposed federal  state and local environmental compliance laws and regulations  which likely would result in increased capital expenditures and o m expenses 
additionally  congress is considering legislation that would require additional reductions in air emissions of nitrogen oxides nox  so  co and mercury 
some of these proposals establish nationwide caps and emission rates over an extended period of time 
this national multipollutant approach to air pollution control could involve significant capital costs that could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
control equipment installed pursuant to the provisions of cair  cavr and mercury regulation  which are discussed below  may address some of the issues outlined above 
pec and pef have been developing an integrated compliance strategy to meet the requirements of the cair  cavr and mercury regulation see discussion of the court decisions that impacted the cair  the delisting determination and the camr below 
the cavr requires the installation of best available retrofit technology bart on certain units 
however  the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted 
clean smokestacks act in june  the clean smokestacks act was enacted in north carolina requiring the state s electric utilities to reduce the emissions of nox and so from their north carolina coal fired power plants in phases by pec currently has approximately  mw of coal fired generation capacity in north carolina that is affected by the clean smokestacks act 
in march  pec filed its annual estimate with the ncuc of the total capital expenditures to meet emission targets under the clean smokestacks act by the end of  which were approximately billion to billion at the time of the filing 
the increase in estimated total capital expenditures from the original estimate of million is primarily due to the higher cost and revised quantities of construction materials  such as concrete and steel  refinement of cost and scope estimates for the current projects  and increases in the estimated inflation factor applied to future project costs 
we are continuing to evaluate various design  technology and new generation options that could change expenditures required by the clean smokestacks act 
changes in projected fuel sources may require us to incur costs  which are not currently estimable  to install additional controls subsequent to in order to remain compliant with the requirements of the clean smokestacks act 
o m expenses will significantly increase due to the cost of reagents  additional personnel and general maintenance associated with the pollution control equipment 
recent legislation in north carolina and south carolina expanded the traditional fuel clause to include the annual recovery of reagents and certain other costs  all other o m expenses are currently recoverable through base rates 
see discussion regarding future recovery of costs to comply with the clean smokestacks act in note b 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
two of pec s largest coal fired generating units the roxboro no 
and mayo units impacted by the clean smokestacks act are jointly owned 
in  pec entered into an agreement with the joint owner to limit their aggregate costs associated with capital expenditures to comply with the clean smokestacks act and recognized a liability related to this indemnification see note b 
clean air interstate rule on march   the epa issued the final cair 
the epa s rule required the district of columbia and states  including north carolina  south carolina and florida  to reduce nox and so emissions 
the cair set emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  for nox and beginning in and  respectively  for so states were required to adopt rules implementing the cair and the epa approved the north carolina cair  the south carolina cair and the florida cair in pef participated in a coalition of florida utilities that filed a challenge to the cair as it applied to florida pef withdrew from the coalition during the fourth quarter of 
on july   the dc court of appeals issued its decision on multiple challenges to the cair  including the florida challenge  which vacated the cair in its entirety 
on september   petitions for rehearing were filed by several parties 
on october   the dc court of appeals issued an order directing petitioners to address whether any party is seeking to vacate the cair  and whether the court should stay its mandate until the epa promulgates a revised rule 
on december   the dc court of appeals remanded the cair  without vacating the rule  for the epa to conduct further proceedings consistent with the dc court of appeals prior opinion 
this decision leaves the cair in effect until such time that it is revised or replaced 
the outcome of the additional proceedings cannot be predicted 
pef is continuing construction of its in process emission control projects 
on december   pef and the fdep announced an agreement under which pef will retire cr and cr as coal fired units and complete construction of its emission control projects at cr and cr cr and cr will be retired after the second proposed nuclear unit at levy completes its first fuel cycle  which is anticipated to be around we account for emission allowances as inventory using the average cost method 
we value inventory of the utilities at historical cost consistent with ratemaking treatment 
at december   pec had approximately million in so emission allowances and an immaterial amount of nox emission allowances 
in order to achieve compliance with the requirements of the cair pursuant to its integrated clean air compliance plan discussed further in compliance strategy  pef needed to purchase cair seasonal and annual nox allowances 
on november   the fpsc approved pef s petition for recovery of its cair expenses  including nox allowance inventory expense  through the ecrc 
at december   pef had approximately million in annual nox emission allowance inventory  million in seasonal nox emission allowance inventory and approximately million in so emission allowance inventory 
so emission allowances will be utilized to comply with existing clean air act requirements 
clean air mercury rule on march   the epa finalized two separate but related rules the camr that set mercury emissions limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  and encouraged a cap and trade approach to achieving those caps  and a delisting rule that eliminated any requirement to pursue a maximum achievable control technology approach for limiting mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
sixteen states subsequently petitioned for a review of the epa s determination confirming the delisting 
on february   the dc court of appeals decided in favor of the petitioners and vacated the delisting determination and the camr 
on march   the epa and the utility air regulatory group filed petitions for rehearing by the full court of appeals  which were denied on may  on september   the utility air regulatory group filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the us supreme court with regard to the decision that vacated the camr 
on october   the epa filed a similar petition and subsequently withdrew it on january  the utility air regulatory group s petition for writ of certiorari was denied on february  the three states in which the utilities operate adopted mercury regulations implementing the camr and submitted their state implementation rules to the epa 
it is uncertain how the decision that vacated the federal camr and any review granted by the supreme court will affect the state rules  however  state specific provisions are likely to remain in effect 
the north carolina mercury rule contains a requirement that all coal fired units in the state install mercury controls by december   and requires compliance plan applications to be submitted in the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
clean air visibility rule on june   the epa issued the final cavr 
the epa s rule requires states to identify facilities  including power plants  built between august and august with the potential to produce emissions that affect visibility in specially protected areas  including national parks and wilderness areas  designated as class i areas 
to help restore visibility in those areas  states must require the identified facilities to install bart to control their emissions 
pec s bart eligible units are asheville units no 
and no 
 roxboro units no 
 no 
and no 
 and sutton unit no 
pef s bart eligible units are anclote units no 
and no 
 bartow unit no 
and cr and cr the reductions associated with bart begin in as discussed above  on december   pef and the fdep announced an agreement under which pef will retire cr and cr as coal fired units 
the cavr included the epa s determination that compliance with the nox and so requirements of the cair could be used by states as a bart substitute to fulfill bart obligations  but the states could require the installation of additional air quality controls if they did not achieve reasonable progress in improving visibility 
the dc court of appeal s december  decision remanding the cair maintained its implementation such that cair satisfies bart for so and nox 
depending on whether this determination continues to be maintained as the cair is revised  cavr compliance eventually may require consideration of nox and so emissions in addition to particulate matter emissions for bart eligible units 
as a result  bart for so and nox could apply specifically to pec s and pef s bart eligible units 
we are assessing the potential impact of bart and its implications with respect to our plans and estimated costs to comply with the cavr 
on december   the fdep finalized a regional haze implementation rule that goes beyond bart by requiring sources significantly impacting visibility in class i areas to install additional controls by december  however  the fdep has not determined the level of additional controls pef may have to implement 
the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted 
compliance strategy both pec and pef have been developing an integrated compliance strategy to meet the requirements of the cair  the cavr  mercury regulation and related air quality regulations 
the air quality controls installed to comply with the requirements of the nox sip call rule under section of the clean air act nox sip call and clean smokestacks act resulted in a reduction of the costs to meet the cair requirements for our north carolina units at pec 
pec has completed installation of controls to meet the nox sip call requirements 
the nox sip call is not applicable to sources in florida 
expenditures for the nox sip call included the cost to install nox controls under programs by north carolina and south carolina to comply with the federal eight hour ozone standard 
on october   the fpsc approved pef s petition for the recovery of costs associated with the development and implementation of an integrated clean air compliance plan to comply with the cair  camr and cavr through the ecrc see discussion above regarding the vacating of the camr and remanding of the cair 
on march   pef filed a series of compliance alternatives with the fpsc to meet these federal environmental rules 
at the time  pef s recommended proposed compliance plan included approximately million of estimated capital costs expected to be spent through  to plan  design  build and install pollution control equipment at the anclote and crystal river plants 
on november   the fpsc approved pef s petition for its integrated strategy to address compliance with the cair  camr and cavr 
they also approved cost recovery of prudently incurred costs necessary to achieve this strategy 
on june   pef filed a supplemental petition for approval of its recommended compliance plan and associated contracts and recovery of costs for air pollution control projects 
the estimated capital cost for the recommended plan was billion in the june  filing 
the increase from the estimates filed in march is primarily due to the higher cost of labor and construction materials  such as concrete and steel  and refinement of cost and scope estimates for the current projects 
on april   pef filed a petition for approval true up of final environmental costs and a review of the integrated clean air compliance plan  which reconfirmed the efficacy of the recommended plan 
additional costs may be incurred if pollution controls are required in order to comply with the requirements of the cavr  as discussed above  or to meet revised compliance requirements of a revised or new implementing rule for the cair 
subsequent rule interpretations  increases in the underlying material  labor and equipment costs  equipment availability  or the unexpected acceleration of compliance dates  among other things  could result in significant increases in our estimated costs to comply and acceleration of some projects 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
environmental compliance cost estimates environmental compliance cost estimates are dependent upon a variety of factors and  as such  are highly uncertain and subject to change 
factors impacting our environmental compliance cost estimates include new and frequently changing laws and regulations  the impact of legal decisions on environmental laws and regulations  changes in the demand for  supply of and costs of labor and materials  changes in the scope and timing of projects  various design  technology and new generation options  and projections of fuel sources  prices  availability and security 
the following tables contain information about our current estimates of capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations described above 
amounts presented in the tables exclude afudc 
costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses 
the outcome of future petitions for recovery cannot be predicted 
our estimates of capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly 
we cannot predict the impact that the epa s further cair proceedings will have on our compliance with the cavr requirements and will continue to reassess our plans and estimated costs to comply with the cavr 
our estimated costs to comply with the cavr prior to the july  dc court of appeals decision regarding cair were approximately million at pec 
our previous estimate of billion to comply with the cavr at pef related primarily to installation of control equipment at cr and cr  which we subsequently have decided to retire as coal fired units 
the timing and extent of the costs for future projects will depend upon final compliance strategies

to date  under the first phase of clean smokestacks act emission reductions  all environmental compliance projects at pec s asheville  lee and roxboro plants have been placed in service 
the remaining first phase project at one of pec s largest plants  mayo  is under construction and is expected to be completed in the remaining projects to comply with the second phase of emission reductions  which are smaller in scope  have not yet begun 
these estimates are conceptual in nature and subject to change 
in  pec determined that its in process cair project did not yield the desired compliance results and decided not to pursue completion of the project 
additional compliance projects requiring material environmental compliance costs may be implemented in the future 
to date  expenditures at pef for cair regulation primarily relate to environmental compliance projects under construction at cr and cr  which are expected to be placed in service in and  respectively 
as a result of changes in the scope of work related to estimation of costs for compliance with the cair and the uncertainty regarding the epa s further cair proceedings  the delisting determination and the camr discussed above  pef is currently unable to estimate certain costs of compliance 
however  pef believes that future costs to comply with new or subsequent rule interpretations could be significant 
compliance plans and estimated costs to meet the requirements of new regulations will be determined when those new regulations are finalized 
north carolina attorney general petition under section of the clean air act in march  the north carolina attorney general filed a petition with the epa  under section of the clean air act  asking the federal government to force coal fired power plants in other states  including south carolina  to reduce their nox and so emissions 
the state of north carolina contends these out of state emissions interfere with north carolina s ability to meet national air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter 
on march   the epa issued a final response denying the petition 
the epa s rationale for denial was that compliance with the cair would reduce the emissions from surrounding states sufficiently to address north carolina s concerns 
on june   the north carolina attorney general filed a petition in the dc court of appeals seeking a review of the agency s denial of the section petition  that appeal was held in abeyance pending resolution of the appeal of the cair then pending before the same court 
on july   the dc court of appeals vacated the cair 
on december   the dc court of appeals remanded the cair  without vacating the rule  for the epa to conduct further proceedings consistent with the dc court of appeals prior opinion 
on the basis of these developments  the appeal of epa s denial of north carolina s section petition was resumed and briefing on the merits has been completed 
oral argument is scheduled for march  the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
national ambient air quality standards on september   the epa announced changes to the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for particulate matter  including a new hour standard for particulate matter less than microns in diameter  which lowered the standard from micrograms per cubic meter to micrograms per cubic meter 
in addition  the epa decided not to establish a standard for particulate matter between and microns in diameter and eliminated the annual standard for particulate matter less than microns in diameter  but retained the hour standard for particulate matter less than microns in diameter 
these changes did not result in designation of any additional nonattainment areas in pec s or pef s service territories 
environmental groups and states filed a joint petition with the dc court of appeals arguing that the epa s new particulate matter rule does not adequately restrict levels of particulate matter  especially with respect to the annual and secondary standards 
on february   the dc court of appeals remanded the annual and secondary standards to the epa for further review and consideration 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
on march   the epa announced changes to the naaqs for ground level ozone 
the epa revised the hour primary and secondary standards from parts per million to parts per million 
depending on air quality improvements expected over the next several years as current federal requirements are implemented  additional nonattainment areas may be designated in pec s and pef s service territories 
should additional nonattainment areas be designated in our service territories  we may be required to install additional emission controls at some of our facilities 
on may   a number of states  environmental groups and industry associations filed petitions against the revised naaqs in the dc court of appeals 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
on october   the epa published a revision to the naaqs for lead to micrograms per cubic meter rolling three month average 
the former standard was micrograms per cubic meter  calendar quarter average 
the revision is not expected to have a material impact on our or the utilities results of operations or financial position 
new source review the epa is conducting an enforcement initiative related to a number of coal fired utility power plants in an effort to determine whether changes at those facilities were subject to new source review requirements or new source performance standards under the clean air act 
we were asked to provide information to the epa as part of this initiative and cooperated in supplying the requested information 
the epa has undertaken civil enforcement actions against unaffiliated utilities as part of this initiative 
some of these actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring expenditures by these unaffiliated utilities  several of which included reported expenditures in excess of billion for retrofit of pollution control equipment 
these settlement agreements have generally called for expenditures to be made over extended time periods  and some of the companies may seek recovery of the related costs through rate adjustments or similar mechanisms 
water quality general as a result of the operation of certain control equipment needed to address the air quality issues outlined above  new wastewater streams will be generated at certain affected facilities 
integration of these new wastewater streams into the existing wastewater treatment processes is currently ongoing and will result in permitting  construction and treatment requirements imposed on the utilities now and into the future 
the future costs of these requirements could be material to our or the utilities results of operations or financial position 
section b of the clean water act section b of the clean water act section b requires cooling water intake structures to reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts 
the epa promulgated a rule implementing section b in respect to existing power plants in july the july rule required assessment of the baseline environmental effect of withdrawal of cooling water and development of technologies and measures for reducing environmental effects by certain percentages 
additionally  the rule authorized establishment of alternative performance standards where the site specific costs of achieving the otherwise applicable standards would have been substantially greater than either the benefits achieved or the costs considered by the epa during the rulemaking 
subsequent to promulgation of the rule  a number of states  environmental groups and others sought judicial review of the rule 
on january   the us court of appeals for the second circuit issued an opinion and order remanding many provisions of the rule to the epa 
on july   the epa suspended the rule pending further rulemaking  with the exception of the requirement that permitted facilities must meet any requirements under section b as determined by the permitting authorities on a case by case  best professional judgment basis 
on december   the us supreme court heard arguments related to whether the epa is authorized to compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact at cooling water intake structures 
as a result of these developments  our plans and associated estimated costs to comply with section b will need to be reassessed and determined in accordance with any revised or new implementing rule once it is established by the epa 
costs of compliance with a new implementing rule are expected to be higher  and could be significantly higher  than estimated costs under the july rule 
our most recent cost estimates to comply with the july implementing rule were million to million  including million to million at pec and million to million at pef 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
other environmental matters global climate change the kyoto protocol was adopted in by the united nations to address global climate change by reducing emissions of co and other greenhouse gases 
the treaty went into effect on february  the united states has not adopted the kyoto protocol 
growing state  federal and international attention to global climate change may result in the regulation of co and other greenhouse gases 
the obama administration has agreed to review whether or not co emissions from coal fired power plants should be regulated 
we are preparing for a carbon constrained future and are actively engaged in helping shape effective policies to address the issue 
while state level study groups are active in all three of our jurisdictions  we continue to believe that this is an issue that requires a national policy framework one that provides certainty and consistency 
our balanced solution is a comprehensive plan to meet the anticipated demand in the utilities service territories and provides a solid basis for slowing and reducing co emissions by focusing on energy efficiency  alternative energy and state of the art power generation as discussed under other matters increasing energy demand 
in addition to a report issued in  we issued an updated report on global climate change in the second quarter of  which further evaluates and states our position on this dynamic issue 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
reductions in co emissions to the levels specified by the kyoto protocol and some additional proposals could be materially adverse to our financial position or results of operations if associated costs of control or limitation cannot be recovered from ratepayers 
the cost impact of legislation or regulation to address global climate change would depend on the specific legislation or regulation enacted and cannot be determined at this time 
as discussed under other matters regulatory environment  in the state of florida passed comprehensive energy legislation  which includes a directive that the fdep develop rules to establish a cap and trade program to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that would be presented to the legislature no earlier than january on april   the us supreme court ruled that the epa has the authority under the clean air act to regulate co emissions from new automobiles 
on april   states and environmental groups filed an action in the dc court of appeals against the epa administrator seeking an order requiring the epa to make a determination within days of whether greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare 
the dc court of appeals denied the petition on june  on july   the epa issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking inviting public comment on the issues and options that should be considered in development of comprehensive greenhouse gas regulation under the clean air act 
prior to  the epa received waiver requests from a number of states to allow those states to set standards for co emissions from new vehicles 
the epa denied those requests 
on january   the obama administration requested the epa to review its earlier denials of waiver requests by states to regulate co emissions from vehicles 
the impact of these developments cannot be predicted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks related to changes in market conditions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have a risk management committee that includes senior executives from various business groups 
the risk management committee is responsible for administering risk management policies and monitoring compliance with those policies by all subsidiaries 
under our risk policy  we may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
such instruments contain credit risk to the extent that the counterparty fails to perform under the contract 
we minimize such risk by performing credit and financial reviews using a combination of financial analysis and publicly available credit ratings of such counterparties see note 
both pec and pef also have limited counterparty exposure for commodity hedges primarily gas and oil hedges by spreading concentration risk over a number of partners 
the following disclosures about market risk contain forward looking statements that involve estimates  projections  goals  forecasts  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
please review item a  risk factors  and safe harbor for forward looking statements for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
certain market risks are inherent in our financial instruments  which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
our primary exposures are changes in interest rates with respect to our long term debt and commercial paper  fluctuations in the return on marketable securities with respect to our nuclear decommissioning trust funds  changes in the market value of cvos and changes in energy related commodity prices 
these financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the risks discussed below do not include the price risks associated with nonfinancial instrument transactions and positions associated with our operations  such as purchase and sales commitments and inventory 
progress energy interest rate risk as part of our debt portfolio management and daily cash management  we have variable rate long term debt and typically have commercial paper and or loans outstanding under our rca facilities  which are also exposed to floating interest rates 
approximately percent and percent of consolidated debt had variable rates at december  and  respectively 
based on our variable rate long term debt balances at december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual pre tax interest expense change of approximately million 
based on our short term debt balances at december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual pre tax interest expense change of approximately million 
from time to time  we use interest rate derivative instruments to adjust the mix between fixed and floating rate debt in our debt portfolio  to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with certain debt instruments and to hedge interest rates with regard to future fixed rate debt issuances 
the notional amounts of interest rate derivatives are not exchanged and do not represent exposure to credit loss 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the risk in the transaction is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
we enter into interest rate derivative agreements only with banks with credit ratings of single a or better 
we use a number of models and methods to determine interest rate risk exposure and fair value of derivative positions 
for reporting purposes  fair values and exposures of derivative positions are determined at the end of the reporting period using the bloomberg financial markets system 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas no 
 interest rate derivatives that qualify as hedges are separated into one of two categories cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
cash flow hedges are used to reduce exposure to changes in cash flow due to fluctuating interest rates 
fair value hedges are used to reduce exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate changes 
the following tables provide information at december  and  about our interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
the tables present principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed and variable rate long term debt and florida progress obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of trust 
the tables also include estimates of the fair value of our interest rate risk sensitive instruments based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues 
for interest rate swaps and interest rate forward contracts  the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates for to and thereafter and the related fair value 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the interest rate swaps and the settlement amounts under the interest rate forward contracts

on september   pec amended its year forward starting swap in order to move the maturity date from october   to april  marketable securities price risk the utilities maintain trust funds  pursuant to nrc requirements  to fund certain costs of decommissioning their nuclear plants 
these funds are primarily invested in stocks  bonds and cash equivalents  which are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and to changes in interest rates 
at december  and  the fair value of these funds was billion and billion  respectively  including million and million  respectively  for pec and million and million  respectively  for pef 
we actively monitor our portfolio by benchmarking the performance of our investments against certain indices and by maintaining  and periodically reviewing  target allocation percentages for various asset classes 
the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that the utilities regulated electric rates provide for recovery of these costs net of any trust fund earnings  and  therefore  fluctuations in trust fund marketable security returns do not affect earnings 
see note for further information on the trust fund securities 
contingent value obligations market value risk in connection with the acquisition of florida progress  the parent issued million cvos 
each cvo represents the right of the holder to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuels facilities purchased by subsidiaries of florida progress in october the payments are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate 
the cvos are derivatives and are recorded at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
we perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market risk of the cvos 
the sensitivity analysis performed on the cvos uses quoted prices obtained from brokers or quote services to measure the potential loss in earnings from a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices over the next months 
at december  and  the cvo liability included in other liabilities and deferred credits on our consolidated balance sheets was million 
a hypothetical percent increase in the december  market price would result in a million increase in the fair value of the cvos and a corresponding increase in the cvo liability 
commodity price risk we are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  coal  fuel oil  electricity and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of our ownership of energy related assets 
our exposure to these fluctuations is significantly limited by the cost based regulation of the utilities 
each state commission allows electric utilities to recover certain of these costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines that such costs are prudent 
therefore  while there may be a delay in the timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered from the ratepayers  changes from year to year have no material impact on operating results 
in addition  most of our long term power sales contracts shift substantially all fuel price risk to the purchaser 
most of our physical commodity contracts are not derivatives or qualify as normal purchases or sales pursuant to sfas no 
therefore  such contracts are not recorded at fair value 
we perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market risk of our derivative commodity instruments that are not eligible for recovery from ratepayers 
the following discussion addresses the stand alone commodity risk created by these derivative commodity instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge 
the sensitivity analysis performed on these derivative commodity instruments uses quoted prices obtained from brokers to measure the potential loss in earnings from a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices over the next months 
at december   substantially all derivative commodity instrument positions were subject to retail regulatory treatment 
at december   the only derivative commodity instruments not eligible for recovery from ratepayers related to derivative contracts entered into on january   to hedge economically a portion of our synthetic fuels cash flow exposure to the risk of rising oil prices as discussed below 
these contracts ended on december   and were settled for cash on january   with no material impact to earnings 
see note for additional information with regard to our commodity contracts and use of derivative financial instruments 
discontinued operations as discussed in note c  in our subsidiary  pvi  sold or assigned substantially all of its cco physical and commercial assets and liabilities representing substantially all of our nonregulated energy marketing and trading operations 
for the year ended december   million of after tax gains from derivative instruments related to our nonregulated energy marketing and trading operations were included in discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income 
on january   we entered into derivative contracts to hedge economically a portion of our synthetic fuels cash flow exposure to the risk of rising oil prices over an average annual oil price range of to per barrel on a new york mercantile exchange basis 
the notional quantity of these oil price hedge instruments was million barrels and provided protection for the equivalent of approximately million tons of synthetic fuels production 
the cost of the hedges was approximately million 
the contracts were marked to market with changes in fair value recorded through earnings 
these contracts ended on december   and were settled for cash on january   with no material impact to earnings 
approximately percent of the notional quantity of these contracts was entered into by ceredo 
as discussed in note j  we disposed of our percent ownership interest in ceredo on march  progress energy is the primary beneficiary of  and continues to consolidate  ceredo in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r  but we have recorded a percent minority interest 
consequently  subsequent to the disposal there is no net earnings impact for the portion of the contracts entered into by ceredo 
at december   the fair value of all of these contracts was recorded as a million short term derivative asset position  including million at ceredo 
the fair value of these contracts was included in receivables  net on the consolidated balance sheet see note 
we had a million cash collateral liability related to these contracts at december   included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
as discussed in note a  on october   we permanently ceased production of synthetic fuels at our majority owned facilities 
because we have abandoned our majority owned facilities and our other synthetic fuels operations ceased as of december   gains and losses on these contracts were included in discontinued operations  net of tax on the consolidated statement of income in during the year ended december   we recorded net pre tax gains of million related to these contracts 
of this amount  million was attributable to ceredo  of which million was attributed to minority interest for the portion of the gain subsequent to the disposal of ceredo 
due to the divestitures of gas and cco  management determined that it was no longer probable that the forecasted transactions underlying certain derivative contracts would be fulfilled and cash flow hedge accounting for the contracts was discontinued in for the year ended december   discontinued operations  net of tax on the consolidated statements of income included million in after tax deferred income  which was reclassified to earnings due to discontinuance of the related cash flow hedges  and immaterial net gains and losses from other derivative instruments related to gas and cco 
economic derivatives derivative products  primarily natural gas and oil contracts  may be entered into from time to time for economic hedging purposes 
while management believes the economic hedges mitigate exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices  these instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are monitored consistent with trading positions 
certain of our hedge agreements may result in the receipt of  or posting of  derivative collateral with our counterparties  depending on the daily derivative position 
fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to our return of collateral received and or our posting of collateral with our counterparties negatively impact our liquidity 
we manage open positions with strict policies that limit our exposure to market risk and require daily reporting to management of potential financial exposures 
the utilities have derivative instruments related to their exposure to price fluctuations on fuel oil and natural gas purchases 
substantially all of these instruments receive regulatory accounting treatment 
related unrealized gains and losses are recorded in regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets  respectively  on the balance sheets until the contracts are settled see note a 
after settlement of the derivatives and the fuel is consumed  realized gains or losses are passed through the fuel cost recovery clause 
during the years ended december  and  pec recorded a net realized gain of million and a net realized loss of million  respectively 
pec s net realized loss was not material during the year ended december  during the years ended december   and  pef recorded a net realized gain of million  a net realized loss of million and a net realized gain of million  respectively 
at december   the fair value of pec s commodity derivative instruments was recorded as a million short term derivative liability position included in derivative liabilities and a million long term derivative liability position included in other liabilities and deferred credits on the pec consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the fair value of such instruments was recorded as a million long term derivative asset position included in other assets and deferred debits and a million short term derivative liability position included in derivative liabilities on the pec consolidated balance sheet 
certain counterparties have held cash collateral with pec in support of these instruments 
pec had an million cash collateral asset included in prepayments and other current assets on the pec consolidated balance sheet at december   and no cash collateral position at december  at december   the fair value of pef s commodity derivative instruments was recorded as a million short term derivative asset position included in current derivative assets  a million long term derivative asset position included in derivative assets  a million short term derivative liability position included in current derivative liabilities  and a million long term derivative liability position included in derivative liabilities on the pef balance sheet 
at december   the fair value of such instruments was recorded as an million short term derivative asset position included in current derivative assets  a million long term derivative asset position included in derivative assets  a million short term derivative liability position included in current derivative liabilities  and a million long term derivative liability position included in derivative liabilities on the pef balance sheet 
certain counterparties have posted or held cash collateral in support of these instruments 
pef had a million cash collateral asset included in derivative collateral posted and a million cash collateral liability included in other current liabilities on the pef balance sheet at december   and no cash collateral position at december  cash flow hedges the utilities designate a portion of commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
the objective for holding some of these instruments is to hedge exposure to market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of power for our forecasted sales 
realized gains and losses are recorded net in operating revenues 
we also hedge exposure to market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of fuel for fleet vehicles 
realized gains and losses are recorded net as part of fleet vehicle costs 
at december  and  neither we nor the utilities had material outstanding positions in such contracts 
the ineffective portion of commodity cash flow hedges was not material to our or the utilities results of operations for  and at december  and  the amount recorded in our or the utilities accumulated other comprehensive income related to commodity cash flow hedges was not material
