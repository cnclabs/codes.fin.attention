mergers and acquisitions on november   whitney completed its acquisition of parish national corporation parish  the parent of parish national bank 
parish national bank operated banking centers  primarily on the north shore of lake pontchartrain and other parts of the metropolitan new orleans area  and had million in total assets  including a loan portfolio of million  and million in deposits at the acquisition date 

table of contents the transaction was valued at approximately million  with approximately million paid to parish s shareholders in cash and the remainder in whitney stock totaling approximately million shares

the rates on approximately of the loan portfolio at december  were tied to changes in libor benchmarks  with another tied to prime 
declining market rates also led to a sharp reduction in rates paid on interest bearing deposits and short term borrowings 
the benefit to whitney s cost of funds was offset partially by the increased use of short term borrowings in the funding mix to support earning asset growth

critical accounting policies and significant estimates whitney prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a discussion of certain accounting principles and methods of applying those principles that are particularly important to this process is included in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the company is required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in applying these principles to determine the amounts and other disclosures that are presented in the financial statements and discussed in this section 
allowance for credit losses whitney believes that the determination of its estimate of the allowance for credit losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its application of other significant accounting policies 
factors considered in this determination and management s process are discussed in note and in the section below entitled loans  credit risk management and allowance and reserve for credit losses 
although management believes it has identified appropriate factors for review and designed and implemented adequate procedures to support the estimation process that are consistently followed  the allowance remains an estimate about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
over time  changes in national and local economic conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of whitney s credit customers or other factors can materially impact the allowance estimate  potentially subjecting the company to significant earnings volatility 
goodwill impairment test goodwill is assessed for impairment both annually and when events or circumstances occur that make it more likely than not that impairment has occurred 
the impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value 
whitney has assigned all goodwill to one reporting unit that represents 
table of contents the overall banking operations 
the fair value of the reporting unit is based on valuation techniques that market participants would use in an acquisition of the whole unit  such as estimated discounted cash flows  the quoted market price of whitney s stock including an estimated control premium  and observable average price to earnings and price to book multiples of our competitors 
if the unit s fair value is less than its carrying value  an estimate of the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the goodwill s carrying value 
given the current volatility in market prices due in part to significant uncertainty about the financial services industry as a whole and limited activity of healthy bank acquisitions  management placed greater reliance on the discounted cash flow analysis for the annual test 
this analysis requires significant assumptions about the economic environment  expected net interest margins  growth rates and the rate at which cash flows are discounted 
no impairment was indicated when the annual test was performed on september  during the fourth quarter  circumstances such as a decrease in whitney s market price to a level below book value  further asset quality deterioration and declining general economic conditions that reduced estimates of growth and the net interest margin  led management to perform a subsequent impairment test as of december  no indication of goodwill impairment was indicated by this interim test as the analysis resulted in a fair value estimate approximately higher than book value 
either a basis point reduction in the long term expected net interest margin or a lower perpetual growth rate would reduce the estimated fair value by 
given the current economic environment and potential for volatility in the fair value estimate  management will reassess goodwill impairment quarterly 
accounting for retirement benefits management makes a variety of assumptions in applying principles that govern the accounting for benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
these assumptions are essential to the actuarial valuation that determines the amounts whitney recognizes and certain disclosures it makes in the consolidated financial statements related to the operation of these plans see note in item 
two of the more significant assumptions concern the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate needed to discount projected benefits to their present value 
changes in these assumptions impact the cost of retirement benefits recognized in net income and comprehensive income 
certain assumptions are closely tied to current conditions and are generally revised at each measurement date 
for example  the discount rate is reset annually with reference to market yields on high quality fixed income investments 
other assumptions  such as the rate of return on assets  are determined  in part  with reference to historical and expected conditions over time and are not as susceptible to frequent revision 
holding other factors constant  the cost of retirement benefits will move opposite to changes in either the discount rate or the rate of return on assets 
recent trends in the cost of retirement benefits are discussed below in the section entitled noninterest expense 
financial condition loans  credit risk management and allowance and reserve for credit losses loan portfolio developments organic loan growth was  or million  during the parish acquisition accounted for approximately million of the total billion increase in loans from year end to december  loan demand and customer development activity in whitney s texas and louisiana markets were the major contributors to organic loan growth over this period  with additional support coming from the alabama mississippi market 
loans serviced from whitney s operations in houston  texas grew by year over year  those serviced in louisiana markets outside new orleans were up  loans from the metropolitan new orleans area grew  and the alabama mississippi portfolio gained

the following discussion provides an overview of the composition of the different portfolio sectors and the customers served in each  as well as recent changes 
table loans outstanding by type december  in thousands commercial industrial commercial real estate construction  land land development other commercial real estate total commercial real estate residential mortgage consumer total loans the portfolio of commercial and industrial c i loans increased  or million  between year end and  with only a limited contribution from the parish acquisition 
this growth was concentrated in whitney s houston  texas market and its louisiana markets  including strong growth from customers in the oil and gas o g industry 
the recent disruptions in the credit markets have restricted access by some of whitney s commercial customers to traditional borrowing sources and led them to increase their use of existing credit facilities with the bank 
overall  the c i portfolio has remained diversified  with customers in a range of industries  including o g exploration and production  wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products and the manufacture of such products  marine transportation and maritime construction  financial services and professional services 
the growth in market areas outside of metropolitan new orleans in recent years has increased the geographic diversification of customers represented in the c i portfolio 
loans outstanding to oil and gas o g industry customers represented approximately of total loans at december   up from approximately at year end the majority of whitney s customer base in this industry provides transportation and other services and products to support exploration and production activities 
the bank seeks service and supply customers who are quality operators that can manage through volatile commodity price cycles 
loans outstanding to the exploration and production e p sector comprised close to one third of the o g industry portfolio at december  within the e p sector  approximately of the portfolio is related to natural gas production and to oil production based on measures of collateral support 
management monitors both industry fundamentals and portfolio performance and credit quality on a formal ongoing basis and establishes and adjusts internal exposure guidelines as a percent of capital both for the industry as a whole and for individual sectors within the industry 
the slowdown in global economic activity has led to a sharp reduction in commodity prices in recent months and management has made what it believes to be appropriate adjustments to whitney s credit underwriting guidelines and the management of existing relationships 
the level of activity in this industry continues to have an important impact on the economies of certain portions of whitney s market area  particularly houston and southern louisiana 
outstanding balances under participations in larger shared credit loan commitments totaled million at the end of  compared to million outstanding at year end the total at december  included approximately million related to the o g industry 
substantially all of the shared credits are with customers operating in whitney s market area 
the cre portfolio includes loans for construction and land development and investment  both commercial and residential  loans secured by multi family residential properties and other income producing properties  and loans secured by properties used by the owner in c i operations

the cre portfolio sector grew million during  of which approximately million was from the parish acquisition 
the organic growth of  or million  was mainly in the houston  texas market  with smaller contributions from the louisiana and alabama mississippi markets  and involved a variety of retail  commercial and industrial facilities  as well as some multi family and single family residential development 
the lack of growth in the florida based cre portfolio reflected a limited supply of new projects coupled with gradual paydowns on existing project loans 
the growing economic uncertainty during the current recession will slow the availability of new creditworthy cre projects throughout whitney s market area and limit the potential for any growth in this portfolio sector in the residential mortgage loan portfolio increased  or million  during  of which approximately million was from parish 
the organic growth in this portfolio sector was mainly from whitney s louisiana and texas markets 
the bank continues to sell most conventional residential mortgage loan production in the secondary market

written credit policies define underwriting criteria  concentration guidelines  and lending approval processes that cover individual authority and the appropriate involvement of regional loan committees and a senior loan committee 
the senior loan committee includes the bank s senior lenders  senior officers in credit administration  the chief risk officer  the president and the chief executive officer 
c i credits and cre loans  are underwritten principally based upon cash flow coverage  but additional support is regularly obtained through collateralization and guarantees 
c i loans are typically relationship based rather than transaction driven 
loan concentrations are monitored monthly by management and the board of directors 
consumer loans are centrally underwritten with reference to the customer s debt capacity and with the support of automated credit scoring tools  including appropriate secondary review procedures 
lending officers are responsible for ongoing monitoring and the assignment of risk ratings to individual loans based on established guidelines 
an independent credit review function reporting to the audit committee of the board of directors assesses the accuracy of officer ratings and the timeliness of rating changes and performs concurrent reviews of the underwriting processes 
once a problem relationship over a certain size threshold is identified  a monthly watch committee process is initiated 
the watch committee  composed of senior lending and credit administration management as well as the chief executive officer and chief risk officer  must approve any substantive changes to identified problem credits and will assign relationships to a special credits department when appropriate 
management s evaluation of credit risk in the loan portfolio is reflected in the estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio that is reported in the company s financial statements as the allowance for loan losses 
changes in this evaluation over time are reflected in the provision for credit losses charged to expense 
the methodology for determining the allowance involves significant judgment  and important factors that influence this judgment are re evaluated quarterly to respond to changing conditions 
this methodology is described in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of the annual report on form k 
the recorded allowance encompasses three key elements allowances established for losses on criticized loans  allowances based on historical loss experience for loans with acceptable credit quality and groups of homogeneous loans not individually rated  and allowances based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors internal and external to the company 

table of contents the monitoring of credit risk also extends to unfunded credit commitments  such as unused commercial credit lines and letters of credit  and management establishes reserves as needed for its estimate of probable losses on such commitments 
credit quality statistics and components of credit loss allowance and reserve the total of loans criticized through the company s credit risk rating process was million at december   which represented of total loans and a net increase of million from december  criticized loans from the parish acquisition accounted for approximately million of the increase

cre loans on nonresidential investment or income producing properties accounted for approximately of the criticized total  with the majority again concentrated in the florida market 
criticized cre loans secured by properties used in the borrower s business operations represented of the criticized total at december   and loans to c i relationships comprised  with no significant concentrations related to industries or markets 
although management has not identified any systemic portfolio credit issues apart from the real estate problems primarily concentrated in florida and coastal alabama  as the recessionary conditions in the overall economy continue  it is monitoring closely the impact on the performance of the tourism and energy industries  given their importance to the economies in whitney s market area 
included in the total of criticized loans at december  is million of nonperforming loans  which is up a net million from year end approximately two thirds of the nonperforming total at december  was for residential related loans that are heavily concentrated in whitney s florida markets

table recaps activity in the allowance for loan losses and in the reserve for losses on unfunded credit commitments over the past five years 
the allocation of the allowance to loan categories is included in table  together with the percentage of total loans in each category 
the overall allowance for loan losses increased million during  net of the allowance added with parish 
the component of the allowance for criticized loans increased a net million after charge offs of approximately million during the year 
the allowance for loans with average or better credit quality ratings and loans not subject to individual rating increased million for the year  mainly from the impact of recent charge off experience on historical loss factors 
management also added approximately million to the allowance based on its relative assessment of economic and other qualitative risk factors since the end of continuing weaknesses in the residential related real estate markets  primarily in the tampa  florida area  accounted for approximately half of both the million provision and the million in gross charge offs during  mainly related to loans for residential development 
loans for cre development or investment with identified weaknesses accounted for approximately million of the provision and million of gross charge offs  again concentrated in the tampa  florida area 
problem c i credits added approximately million to the provision for and were responsible for approximately million of gross charge offs  with no significant regional or industry concentration 
it is uncertain when sufficient demand will return to depressed residential real estate markets to establish a solid floor on prices and stimulate renewed development 
this  when coupled with the uncertainties arising from the current national recession and weak global economic conditions  makes it difficult for management to predict when the level of criticized loans will stabilize or retreat 
in this environment  the periodic estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio may be volatile

the dividend rate will be reassessed quarterly in light of credit quality trends and expected earnings 
the dividend payout ratio was in and in whitney s ability to pay dividends is also limited by its participation in the treasury s cpp 
prior to december   unless whitney has redeemed the preferred stock issued to the treasury in the cpp or the treasury has transferred the preferred stock to a third party  whitney cannot increase its quarterly dividend above 
per share of common stock 
furthermore  if whitney is not current in the payment of quarterly dividends on the preferred stock  it cannot pay dividends on its common stock

in february  amendments were made to the eesa that changed some of the terms and conditions associated with the cpp  including that tarp recipients may be allowed to redeem the preferred stock without regard to whether the company has replaced such funds from any other source 
the company will monitor the development of regulations regarding these amendments and any other changes in the tarp program that may alter its previous conclusions regarding the benefits of participating in tarp 
liquidity management and contractual obligations liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the operating  capital and strategic cash flow needs of the company and the bank 
whitney develops its liquidity management strategies and measures and monitors liquidity risk as part of its overall asset liability management process  making full use of quantitative modeling tools available to project cash flows under a variety of possible scenarios  including credit stressed conditions 
liquidity management on the asset side primarily addresses the composition and maturity structure of the loan portfolio and the portfolio of investment securities and their impact on the company s ability to generate cash flows from scheduled payments  contractual maturities  and prepayments  through use as collateral for borrowings  and through possible sale or securitization 
table above presents the contractual maturity structure of the loan portfolio and table presents contractual investment maturities 
at december   securities available for sale with a carrying value of billion  out of a total portfolio of billion  were sold under repurchase agreements  pledged to secure public deposits or pledged for other purposes 
on the liability side  liquidity management focuses on growing the base of core deposits at competitive rates  including the use of treasury management products for commercial customers  while at the same time ensuring access to economical wholesale funding sources 
the section above entitled deposits and borrowings discusses changes in these liability funding sources in in october  the fdic temporarily increased deposit insurance coverage limits for all deposit accounts from  to  per depositor through december  and offered to provide unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts and certain other specified deposits over the same period 
whitney elected to participate in the unlimited coverage program 
these steps were taken as part of the federal government s response to the recent severe disruption in the credit markets 
table of contents and were designed to support deposit retention and enhance the liquidity of the nation s insured depository institutions and thereby assist in stabilizing the overall economy  however  there is no assurance these steps will be successful 
wholesale funding currently used by the bank includes fhlb advances and federal funds purchased from upstream correspondents 
the unused borrowing capacity from the fhlb at december  totaled approximately billion and is secured by a blanket lien on loans secured by real estate 
the bank may also borrow from the federal reserve discount window and had a borrowing capacity at december  of approximately million  based on collateral pledged 
in addition  both the company and the bank have access to external funding sources in the financial markets  and the bank has developed the ability to gather deposits at a nationwide level  although it has not used this ability to date 
the company elected to participate in the treasury s tlg program that provides an fdic guarantee for all senior unsecured debt with stated maturities in excess of days which is issued between october  and june  the guarantees will expire no later than june  whitney is eligible to issue up to approximately million of guaranteed debt under the program  but none had been issued as of december  cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows located in item of this annual report on form k present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds for each year in the three year period ended december  dividends received from the bank represent the primary source of funds available to the company for the declaration and payment of dividends to whitney s shareholders  both common and preferred 
there are various regulatory and statutory provisions that limit the amount of dividends that the bank can distribute to the company 
during  the bank will have available an amount equal to approximately million plus its current net income to declare as dividends to the company without prior regulatory approval 
at december   the company had approximately million in cash and demand notes from the bank available to provide liquidity for future dividend payments to its common and preferred shareholders and for other corporate purposes 
contractual obligations table summarizes payments due from the company and the bank under specified long term and certain other contractual obligations as of december  obligations under deposit contracts and short term borrowings are not included 
the maturities of time deposits are scheduled in table above in the section entitled deposits and borrowings 
purchase obligations represent legal and binding contracts to purchase services or goods that cannot be settled or terminated without paying substantially all of the contractual amounts 
not included are a number of contracts entered into to support ongoing operations that either do not specify fixed or minimum amounts of goods or services or are cancelable on short notice without cause and without significant penalty 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide a picture of whitney s ability to fund these and other more significant cash operating expenses  such as interest expense and compensation and benefits  out of current operating cash flows

an million nonqualified plan obligation was recorded at year end c the recorded obligation for postretirement benefits other than pensions was million at december  the funding to purchase benefits for current retirees  net of retiree contributions  has not been significant 
off balance sheet arrangements as a normal part of its business  the company enters into arrangements that create financial obligations that are not recognized  wholly or in part  in the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these arrangements  such as noncancelable operating leases  are reflected in table above 
the most significant off balance sheet obligations are the bank s commitments under traditional credit related financial instruments 
table schedules these commitments as of december  by the periods in which they expire 
commitments under credit card and personal credit lines generally have no stated maturity 
table credit related commitments commitments expiring by period from december  less than more than total year years years years in thousands loan commitments revolving loan commitments nonrevolving credit card and personal credit lines standby and other letters of credit total revolving loan commitments are issued primarily to support commercial activities 
the availability of funds under revolving loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract and has not violated other contractual conditions 
a number of such commitments are used only partially or  in some cases  not at all before they expire 
credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower s credit quality deteriorates  and many lines remain partly or wholly unused 
unfunded balances on revolving loan commitments and credit lines should not be used to project actual future liquidity requirements 
nonrevolving loan commitments are issued mainly to provide financing for the acquisition and development or construction of real property  both commercial and residential  although many are not expected to lead to permanent financing by the bank 
expectations about the level of draws under all credit related commitments  including the prospect of 
table of contents temporarily increased levels of draws on back up commercial facilities during this period of disruption in the credit markets  are incorporated into the company s liquidity and asset liability management models 
substantially all of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the bank to fulfill a customer s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform 
the bank issues standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to its customers other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors 
historically  the bank has had minimal calls to perform under standby agreements 
certain public financing arrangements supported by letters of credit from the bank are structured as variable rate demand notes that are periodically remarketed to reset the interest rate 
the recent disruption in credit markets has led to unsuccessful remarketing efforts for some of these public financings 
to assist its customers  the bank has purchased the underlying instruments until credit market conditions improve sufficiently to restart remarketing efforts or the instruments are refinanced under new arrangements 
such purchases totaled approximately million as of december   and outstanding letters of credit supporting variable rate demand notes totaled approximately million 
asset liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of its financial resources that are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk 
interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows 
the company has developed a model to measure its interest rate sensitivity over the near term primarily by running net interest income simulations 
management also monitors longer term interest rate risk by modeling the sensitivity of its economic value of equity 
the model can be used to test the company s sensitivity in various economic environments 
the model incorporates management s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates 
assumptions can also be entered into the model to evaluate the impact of possible strategic responses to changes in the competitive environment 
management  through the company s investment and asset and liability committee  monitors simulation results against rate sensitivity guidelines specified in whitney s asset liability management policy 
the net interest income simulations run at the end of indicated that whitney was moderately asset sensitive over the near term  which is similar to its position at year end based on these simulations  annual net interest income te would be expected to increase million  or  if interest rates instantaneously increased from current rates by basis points 
the simulation assuming a basis point decrease from current rates was suspended at year end in light of the current rate environment 
these changes are measured against the results of a base simulation run that uses growth forecasts as of the measurement date and that assumes a stable rate environment and structure 
the comparable simulation run at year end produced results that ranged from a positive impact on net interest income te of million  or  to a negative impact of million  or 
the actual impact that changes in interest rates have on net interest income will depend on many factors 
these factors include whitney s ability to achieve expected growth in earning assets and to maintain a desired mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the actual timing when assets and liabilities reprice  the magnitude of interest rate changes and corresponding movement in interest rate spreads  and the level of success of asset liability management strategies that are implemented 
changes in interest rates affect the fair values of financial instruments 
the earlier section entitled investment securities and notes and to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k contain information regarding fair values 
the company has made minimal use of investments in financial instruments or participations in agreements with values that are linked to or derived from changes in the value of some underlying asset or index 
these are commonly referred to as derivatives and include such instruments as interest rate swaps  
table of contents futures  forward contracts  option contracts  and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics 
management continues to evaluate whether to make additional use of derivatives as part of its ongoing asset liability and liquidity management processes

the net interest margin is net interest income te as a percent of average earning assets 
tables and provide details on the components of the company s net interest income te and net interest margin te 
the overall yield on earning assets decreased basis points to in  mainly reflecting the steep reduction in benchmark rates for the large variable rate segment of whitney s loan portfolio 
the higher level of nonaccruing loans in lowered the effective yield by approximately basis points 
loan yields te for declined basis points compared to the rates on approximately  or billion  of the loan portfolio at year end were tied to changes in libor benchmarks  with another tied to prime 
at december   approximately of these variable rate loan agreements contained floor rates that would prevent further rate reductions 
the recent disruption in credit markets has been reflected in wider than normal spreads for libor rates  which benefited whitney s net interest income and margin 
management estimates that the wider than normal libor spreads added basis points to the fourth quarter s net interest margin and basis points to s annual margin 
this benefit is being reduced as the libor spreads return to levels closer to normal historical relationships in the early part of there was a favorable shift in the earning asset mix between these periods  with loans comprising of average earning assets for compared to in in table  loans include loans held for sale

rates on interest bearing deposits and short term borrowings during were down sharply from  consistent with general market rate movements that were driven by the slowing economy and the trend toward liquidity and safety by investors and savers 
the reduction in funding costs from declining rates was partially offset by the impact of a shift between these years toward higher cost sources  which includes time deposits and borrowings 
this shift mainly reflected the increased use of short term borrowings to support earning asset growth 
overall  whitney continues to be moderately asset sensitive over the near term 
in the current economic climate and low rate environment  whitney continues to aggressively manage its loan and deposit rates to maintain a favorable net interest margin  although the ability to further reduce certain deposit and borrowing costs is becoming limited
