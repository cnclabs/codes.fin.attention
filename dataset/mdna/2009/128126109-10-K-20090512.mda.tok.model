in addition  the business offers a backend device management system to minimize support and service costs and also sophisticated unit firmware providing a greater range of vehicle information and communication capabilities 
the purchase price for this acquisition was million in cash and an earn out payment equal to revenues in excess of million during the month period following the acquisition 
the company made earn out payments of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
on march   the company acquired aercept formerly known as aircept  a vehicle tracking business  from airiq inc  a canadian company  for cash consideration of million

aercept s products utilize global positioning satellite gps and cellular technology to provide up to date location and tracking information 
on april   the company acquired the business and substantially all the assets of smartlink radio networks  a privately held company  for cash consideration of million 
the source of funds for the purchase price was the company s cash on hand 
smartlink provides proprietary interoperable radio communications platforms and integration services for public safety and critical infrastructure applications 
smartlink s software defined switch provides interoperability with legacy analog wireless communications networks without the need to replace the installed base of land mobile radios satellite the company s dbs reception products are sold primarily to the two us dbs system operators  echostar and directv  for incorporation into complete subscription satellite television systems 
prior to fiscal  the company s overall revenue consisted principally of sales of satellite television outdoor reception equipment for the us dbs industry 
such sales accounted for and of consolidated revenue in fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal  as a result of a dbs product performance issue as described below  one of the company s dbs customers substantially reduced its purchases of the company s products 
for this reason  sales of dbs products accounted for only of consolidated revenues for fiscal the dbs system operators have an approximately share of the total subscription television market in the us in calendar  the size of the us dbs market grew by from million subscribers to approximately million subscribers at december  during fiscal  the company received notification from one of its dbs customers of a field performance issue with a dbs product that the company began shipping in after examining the various component parts used in the manufacture of these products  it was determined by the company that the performance issue was the result of a deterioration of the printed circuit board pcb laminate material used in these products 
in addition to returning product  in may this dbs customer put on hold all orders for calamp products  including newer generation products  pending the requalification of all products manufactured by the company for this customer 
in january  the customer requalified calamp s designs for the affected products and in late may the company resumed product shipments to this customer 
as of february   the company had  returned units that are expected to be repaired and reshipped to the customer in the future 
during fiscal  the company recorded a charge of million for this matter  which amount is included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company reached a settlement agreement with this customer in december as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the company agreed to rework certain dbs products previously returned to the company or to be returned over a month period and agreed to provide extended warranty periods for workmanship months and product failures due to the issue with the pcb laminate material months 
in addition  as part of the settlement the company issued to the customer a million non interest bearing note payable  a million credit against outstanding receivables due from the customer   shares of common stock and  common stock purchase warrants exercisable at per share for three years 
the note  which had an outstanding balance of million at february   is repayable at a rate of per unit on the first  dbs units purchased by the customer after the date of the settlement agreement  except that for the first  units of a particular product sold between january and may the note payment amount is instead of per unit 
the consideration issued by the company under the settlement agreement reduced the reserves by million 
at february   the company had total reserves of million for this matter 
in may  the company filed a lawsuit against rogers  a pcb laminate supplier for negligence  strict product liability  intentional misrepresentation and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage  among other causes of action 
in january  the company reached an out of court settlement of litigation with rogers  pursuant to which rogers paid the company million cash 
in the settlement agreement the parties acknowledged that rogers admitted no wrongdoing or liability for any claim  and that rogers agreed to settle this litigation to avoid the time  expense and inconvenience of continued litigation 
both parties gave mutual releases of all claims and demands existing as of the settlement date 
discontinued operations the company s acquisition of vytek corporation vytek in april gave rise to goodwill of approximately million 
in accordance with the applicable accounting rules  the goodwill of million was apportioned between calamp s solutions division and former products division now split into two segments satellite and wireless datacom because both segments were expected to benefit from the acquisition 
the apportionment analysis resulted in allocating million of the goodwill to the products division and the remaining million to the solutions division 
as a result of the fiscal annual impairment test of the solutions division goodwill conducted as of april   the company determined that there was an impairment of goodwill  and accordingly  an impairment charge was recorded in fiscal in the amount of  in addition  the company recorded an  impairment charge related to the other intangible assets arising from the vytek acquisition 
the impairment charges reflected the declining revenues associated with the solutions division s information technology professional consulting business  due primarily to the inability of the solutions division to generate new recurring revenue streams to grow the business 
the company sold the telalert software business of the solutions division to a privately held company on august  for total consideration of million  consisting of million in cash  a non interest bearing note with present value of million and preferred stock of the acquirer initially valued at million 
as of february   the estimated fair value of the preferred stock was million 
the company concluded that this decline in fair value was not temporary and accordingly recorded an impairment loss of million 
the company recognized a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the telalert software business 
the income tax expense attributable to the gain was million because at the time of sale there was goodwill of million associated with this business that was not deductible for income tax purposes 
the telalert software business was the remaining business of the solutions division 
operating results for the solutions division have been presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a discontinued operation  as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the solutions division goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal described above in the aggregate amount of  are included in the loss from operations of discontinued operations  net of tax in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended february  critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made include  but are not limited to the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  product warranties  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and the valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for estimated bad debts based upon a review and evaluation of specific customer accounts identified as known and expected collection problems  based on historical experience  or due to insolvency or other collection issues 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company s customer base is concentrated  with three customers accounting for of the company s fiscal sales 
changes in either a key customer s financial position  or the economy as a whole  could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the recorded allowance amount 
inventories the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed the associated carrying values  inventory carrying amounts are written down 
in addition  the company generally treats inventory on hand or committed with suppliers  which is not expected to be sold within the next months  as excess and thus appropriate write downs of the inventory carrying amounts are established through a charge to cost of revenues 
estimated usage in the next months is based on firm demand represented by orders in backlog at the end of the quarter and management s estimate of sales beyond existing backlog  giving consideration to customers forecasted demand  ordering patterns and product life cycles 
significant reductions in product pricing  or changes in technology and or demand may necessitate additional write downs of inventory carrying value in the future 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  at february  the company had an inventory reserve of million that was established during fiscal in connection with a product performance issue involving a key dbs customer 
also as described in note  the company had on hand inventory of million and outstanding purchase commitments of million for materials that are specific to the products that the company manufactures for this customer 
these amounts are not currently reserved for because the company believes these materials can be used in the ordinary course of business as future shipments of products are made to this customer 
nonetheless  changes in the forecasted product demand from this customer could require that the inventory reserve and or the reserve for vendor commitment liabilities be increased to cover some portion of these amounts 
product warranties the company initially provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while it engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  at february  the company had a million reserve for accrued warranty costs in connection with a product performance issue involving a key dbs customer 
the company believes that this warranty reserve will be adequate to cover total future product rework costs under this settlement agreement 
deferred income tax and uncertain tax positions deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized if realization of such asset is more likely than not  based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes historical operating performance and the company s forecast of future operating performance 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred income tax asset on a quarterly basis  and a valuation allowance is provided  as necessary  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
during this evaluation  the company reviews its forecasts of income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred income tax asset to determine if a valuation allowance is needed 
as a result of this realizability evaluation for fiscal  the company increased its deferred tax asset valuation allowance by million 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which was adopted by the company in fiscal  defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities 
fin provides guidance on de recognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
at february   the company had unrecognized tax benefits of  which  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate on income loss from continuing operations 
at february   the company had a net deferred income tax asset balance of million 
the current portion of this deferred tax asset is million and the noncurrent portion is million 
the net deferred income tax asset balance is comprised of a gross deferred tax asset of million and a valuation allowance of million 
impairment assessments of goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets at february   the company had million in other intangible assets on its consolidated balance sheet 
the company believes the estimate of its valuation of long lived assets and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because if circumstances arose that led to a decrease in the valuation it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company makes judgments about the recoverability of non goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on the balance sheet may exist 
the company tests the impairment of goodwill annually and  in certain situations  on an interim basis if indicators of impairment arise 
goodwill of the satellite and wireless datacom business segments is tested annually for impairment as of december if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value  goodwill would be evaluated for impairment between annual tests 
management believes that the company has appropriate processes in place to monitor for interim triggering events 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  the company typically makes various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  considers market factors specific to that business and estimates future cash flows to be generated by that business 
these assumptions and estimates are necessarily subjective and based on management s best estimates based on the information available at the time such estimates are made 
based on these assumptions and estimates  the company determines whether it needs to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on the balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in the company s business strategy and its internal forecasts 
although management believes the assumptions and estimates that have been made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the company s reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges in the statement of operations  and lower asset values on the balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges 
the fair values were determined using discounted cash flow dcf analyses of financial projections for each reporting unit 
the annual impairment tests conducted as of december  and resulted in total impairment charges in fiscal and of million and million  respectively 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details 
investment in preferred stock of a private company an investment in preferred stock of a privately held company is included in non current other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and is accounted for under the cost method of accounting because the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the issuer s operations 
the originally ascribed carrying value of million for this preferred stock  which was received as partial consideration for the sale of the telalert software business in august  was determined using the black scholes option pricing model  in which the preferred stock is treated as a series of call options on the entity s enterprise value 
under the cost method of accounting  this investment is carried at cost and is only adjusted for other than temporary declines in fair value and distributions of earnings 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of this preferred stock investment based on the performance and the financial position of the issuer as well as other evidence of market value 
such evaluations include  but are not limited to  reviewing the investee s cash position  recent financings  projected and historical financial performance  cash flow forecasts and financing requirements 
as of february   the estimated fair value of the preferred stock was million 
the company concluded that this decline in fair value was not temporary and accordingly recorded an impairment loss of million 
stock based compensation expense the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in their financial statements 
the company adopted sfas r at the beginning of fiscal accordingly  the company measures stock based compensation expense at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognizes the expense over the employee s requisite service vesting period using the straight line method 
the measurement of stock based compensation expense is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors  such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate 
certain of these inputs are subjective to some degree and are determined based in part on management s judgment 
the company recognizes the compensation expense on a straight line basis for its graded vesting awards 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
however  the cumulative compensation expense recognized at any point in time must at least equal the portion of the grant date fair value of the award that is vested at that date 
as used in this context  the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations  and refers only to the unvested portion of the surrendered equity awards 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
in cases where terms of sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria  revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria are met 
critical judgments made by management related to revenue recognition include the determination of whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential 
the determination of whether or not the customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
critical judgments also include estimates of warranty reserves  which are established based on historical experience and knowledge of the product 
products sold in connection with service contracts are recorded as deferred revenues and the associated product costs are recorded as deferred costs 
these deferred amounts are recognized over the life of the service contract on a straight line basis 
the company also undertakes projects that include the design  development and manufacture of public safety communication systems that are specially customized to customers specifications or that involve fixed site construction 
sales under such contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
costs and estimated revenues are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs 
if the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
critical estimates made by management related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method include the estimation of costs at completion and the determination of the overall margin rate on the specific project

wireless datacom s operating loss of million in fiscal includes a total impairment charge of million 
corporate expenses in fiscal include an impairment charge of million on an investment in preferred stock of a privately held company 
this impairment was primarily attributable to the economic downturn  which adversely impacted the revenues and cash flows of this privately held company 
satellite s negative gross profit of million and operating loss of million in fiscal includes a million charge for estimated expenses to correct a product performance issue involving key dbs customer  as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the operating loss of million for that period also includes a goodwill impairment charge of million 
wireless datacom s operating loss of million in fiscal includes a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the wireless datacom segment operating loss of million in fiscal includes a charge of million to write off in process research and development costs associated with the dataradio acquisition 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue satellite revenue declined million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales to the company s historically largest dbs customer declined by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal also  sales to the company s other dbs customer declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to a reduction of orders caused by pricing and competitive pressures  and the time period involved in getting the next generation product qualified with this customer 
the company does not expect to begin shipping this next generation product until late in fiscal although the company expects that its satellite revenue will increase in fiscal compared to fiscal  in the foreseeable future it does not expect its satellite revenue to fully return to pre fiscal levels as a result of macroeconomic and competitive factors 
wireless datacom revenue decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal more than half of the decrease was due to a decline in sales of radio modules to a key wireless datacom customer due to the demand volatility for that customer s radio products from government agencies 
the remainder of the decrease was due to lower revenues of the wireless datacom businesses attributable to the economic downturn  which has caused both commercial and governmental customers to defer buying decisions 
gross profit loss and gross margins satellite had gross profit of million in fiscal  compared with a negative gross profit of million in fiscal satellite s negative gross profit of million in fiscal includes a million charge for estimated expenses to correct a product performance issue involving a key dbs customer 
the gross profit in fiscal was benefited by i a million gain from a legal settlement with a supplier that was recorded as reduction of cost of revenues  ii million associated with the sale of satellite products for which the inventory cost had been fully reserved in the prior fiscal year  and iii a reduction of million in estimated costs to correct a product performance issue 
wireless datacom gross profit decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due mainly to the decrease in revenues 
wireless datacom s gross margin increased by from in fiscal to in fiscal this margin improvement was due primarily to a million patent sale in the first quarter of fiscal for which the cost of revenues was zero 
excluding the patent sale  wireless datacom s gross margin was in fiscal see also note to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional operating data by business segment 
operating expenses consolidated research and development r d expense decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these decreases are primarily due to personnel reductions in the public safety mobile psm business of the wireless datacom segment 
consolidated selling expenses decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to bad debt reserve reductions of  related to a wireless datacom customer 
consolidated general and administrative expenses g a decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of a reduction of approximately million in g a of the psm business  which included smartlink integration costs of approximately  in fiscal that were not present in fiscal  and lower stock based compensation expense of  the reduction in stock based compensation expense included in g a is primarily attributable to the forfeiture of unvested stock options upon the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer in march partially offsetting the effect of the lower stock based compensation expense and the nonrecurring smartlink integration costs in fiscal was a  charge for severance costs of the company s former satellite president in the second quarter of fiscal amortization of intangibles decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal these decreases were primarily attributable to the contracts backlog intangible assets arising from the may acquisitions of dataradio and the technocom mrm product line that became fully amortized during the first quarter of fiscal the in process research and development iprd write off of  for fiscal was related to the acquisition of smartlink in april non operating expense  net non operating expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the million decrease was primarily due to i a foreign currency gain of  in fiscal compared to a  foreign currency loss in fiscal  and ii a decrease in net interest expense of  because of lower debt in fiscal and because the banks waived previously assessed fees and interest charges of approximately  in january this effect was partially offset by a gain of  on the sale of an investment that was recorded in fiscal income tax provision income tax expense allocated to loss from continuing operations for the year ended february  was million 
the effective income tax rate in fiscal was less than the statutory rate of approximately because i no tax benefit has been provided on the us pretax loss which included portions of goodwill and intangibles impairment charges that are tax deductible  ii no tax benefit has been provided on the pretax loss generated by the company s canadian subsidiary  and iii the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was increased by million in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue satellite segment revenue declined million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decline was primarily attributable to the action taken by the company s historically largest dbs customer to put on hold all orders with the company  including orders for newer generation products  pending a requalification of all products manufactured by calamp for this customer and a review of production processes 
revenues from this customer in fiscal were million lower than in fiscal the company reached a settlement agreement with this customer in december as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company resumed shipments to this customer in may wireless datacom segment revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to fiscal due to i an million increase in sales of radio modules to a wireless datacom customer in support of that customer s contract with the us department of defense  ii the acquisition of aercept in march  which contributed revenue of million in fiscal  and the fact that the operations of dataradio and the technocom mrm business were included for all weeks of fiscal versus only weeks of fiscal gross profit and gross margins the satellite segment had negative gross profit of million for fiscal compared with a gross profit of for fiscal the decline in gross profit is primarily attributable to the million charge for estimated expenses to correct a product performance issue with a key dbs customer and the million decline in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit of the wireless datacom segment increased to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal  which is commensurate with the revenue increase of this segment 
wireless datacom s gross margin decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal due to a change in product mix  primarily due to the acquisition at the beginning of fiscal of aercept  which was operating at lower gross margins than the other businesses within the wireless datacom businesses 
see also note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional operating data by business segment 
operating expenses consolidated r d expense increased by million to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily from higher r d expenses of dataradio 
dataradio s r d expense accounted for million of the increase  offset by a reduction in r d expense associated with the company s satellite segment and the wireless datacom s oem business 
dataradio was included for all weeks of the fiscal period and only weeks of the fiscal period 
consolidated selling expenses increased by million to million for fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to higher selling expenses of dataradio and aercept  which accounted for million and million of the increase  respectively 
as noted above  dataradio was included for all weeks of the fiscal period versus only weeks of the fiscal period  and aercept was acquired in march consolidated g a expenses increased by million for fiscal  which increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of dataradio in may  aercept in march and smartlink in april  which collectively accounted for increased g a of million for fiscal compared to the prior year 
amortization of intangibles increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of aercept and smartlink 
the ipr d write off declined from million for fiscal to  for fiscal the fiscal ipr d write off was related to the acquisition of dataradio  while the fiscal ipr d write off was related to the acquisition of smartlink 
the ipr d of million in fiscal is further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
operating loss the operating loss for fiscal was million  compared to operating income of million for fiscal the operating loss in fiscal is attributable to the impairment charge of million  the million charge for the dbs product performance issue noted above  and the reduction in gross profit due to the million decline in revenues from a key dbs customer 
non operating income expense  net non operating expense for fiscal was  compared to non operating income of  for fiscal the change was primarily due to i an increase in net interest expense of  because of lower invested cash and higher debt in fiscal  ii  in foreign currency loss in fiscal compared to a  gain in fiscal  and iii a gain of  in fiscal on currency hedging activities in connection with the dataradio acquisition  for which the purchase price was denominated in canadian dollars

when the turbulence in the us economy began in september  the company was still in the early stages of regaining the sales volume with its historically largest customer that had been abruptly curtailed in may due to a product performance issue 
the economic downturn  which soon spread around the world  slowed the pace of regaining the lost satellite business and also adversely impacted the company s wireless datacom revenues as customers postponed capital spending 
in response to the downturn in revenues  the company has recently taken action to reduce its costs and expenses by over million on an annualized basis 
in addition  the company has raised cash by selling patents that are not essential to its current business operations and may sell additional patents in the future 
the company received million cash in a legal settlement with rogers corporation in january  of which million was applied to reduce the bank term loan balance 
the company also reduced its level of capital expenditures in fiscal  which was about  lower than the prior year 
through these and other actions  the company believes that it will have adequate resources to continue operating its business in the normal course for at least the next months
