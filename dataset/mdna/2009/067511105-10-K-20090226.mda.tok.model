item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview founded in  bare escentuals is one of the leading prestige cosmetic companies in the united states and an innovator in mineral based cosmetics 
we develop  market and sell branded cosmetics and skin care products primarily under our bareminerals  rareminerals  buxom and md formulations brands worldwide 
we utilize a distinctive marketing strategy and a multi channel distribution model consisting of premium wholesale customers including sephora  ulta and certain department stores  company owned boutiques  infomercials  home shopping television on qvc  spas and salons  international distributors and online shopping 
we believe that this strategy provides not only convenience to our consumers but also allows us to reach the broadest possible spectrum of consumers 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we re evaluated how we internally review our business performance and  in turn  changed our operating segments to be more geographically focused 
as a result  our business is now comprised of three strategic business units constituting reportable segments that we manage separately based on fundamental differences in their operations our north america retail segment includes the united states and canada and consists of our company owned boutiques  premium wholesale customers and spas and salons 
our company owned boutiques enhance our ability to build strong consumer relationships and promote additional product use through personal demonstrations and product consultations 
we also sell to retailers that we believe feature our products in settings that support and reinforce our brand image and provide a premium in store experience 
similarly  our spa and salon customers provide an informative and treatment focused environment in which aestheticians and spa professionals can communicate the benefits of our core products 
our north america direct to consumer segment includes infomercials  home shopping television in the united states and canada and online shopping 
we believe that our infomercial business helps us to build brand awareness  communicate the benefits of our core products and establish a base of recurring revenue because a substantial percentage of new infomercial consumers participate in our continuity program 
our sales through home shopping television help us to build brand awareness  educate consumers through live product demonstrations and develop close connections with our consumers 
in addition  our online shopping business allows us to educate consumers as to the benefits as well as proper usage and application techniques for each product offered 
our international segment includes premium wholesale  spas and salons  home shopping television  infomercial  and international distributors outside of north america 
we have partnered with a third party to build our infomercial business in japan and currently have an international home shopping television presence and appear on qvc in japan  the uk and germany 
we also have a presence in over sephora locations internationally  in department stores in the uk and ireland  and in approximately  spas and salons in the uk we also sell our products in smaller international markets primarily through a network of third party distributors 
we manage our business segments to maximize overall sales growth and market share 
we believe that our multi channel distribution strategy enhances convenience for our consumers  reinforces brand awareness  increases consumer retention rates  and drives corporate cash flow and profitability 
further  we believe that the broad diversification within our segments provides us with expanded opportunities for growth and reduces our dependence on any single distribution channel 
within individual distribution channels  financial results can be affected by the timing of shipments as well as the impact of key promotional events 
our performance depends on economic conditions in the united states and globally and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and spending 
driven in part by the recent challenging economic environment  we 
table of contents have seen a trend across our distribution channels of customers favoring lower ticket  non kit items in lieu of higher priced kits 
although this has the impact of reducing our sales growth  the impact to net income is partially mitigated as these non kit items sell at a higher gross margin 
as a result of the current economic environment  we are closely managing our expenses and allocating resources in order to maximize cash flow and liquidity 
this includes a more conservative approach to inventory management in light of reduced target inventory levels on behalf of our retail partners 
at the same time  we continue to invest strategically in areas that we believe will create long term value including our international operations  domestic distribution expansion  education and field teams  and customer acquisition activities 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately million which will support boutique and department store build outs as well as international infrastructure investments 
basis of presentation we recognize revenue in accordance with the requirements of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
the company records revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse to third party resellers  infomercial customers and online shopping customers or when purchased by consumers at company owned boutiques  each net of estimated returns except in the case of our consignment sales 
for our consignment sales  we recognize sales  net of estimated returns  upon shipment from our consignment partners to their customers 
we recognize postage and handling charges we bill to customers as revenue upon shipment of the related merchandise 
our cost of goods sold consists of the costs associated with the sourcing of our products  including the cost of the product and associated manufacturing costs  inbound freight charges  royalties and internal transfer costs 
additionally  cost of goods sold includes postage and handling costs incurred upon shipment of merchandise 
our gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors  including changes in the relative sales mix between our business segments  changes in the mix of products sold and fluctuations in material costs 
our gross margins differ significantly between product lines and our distribution channels  with sales via third party resellers generally yielding lower margins than in channels in which we sell directly to the consumers 
these factors may cause gross profit and margins to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we anticipate that our cost of goods sold will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our total sales but will remain generally consistent with historical periods on an annual basis as a percentage of net sales depending on the mix of sales among our products and distribution channels 
selling  general and administrative expenses include infomercial production and media costs  advertising costs  rent and other store operating costs and corporate costs such as management salaries  information technology  professional fees  finance and accounting personnel  human resources personnel and other administrative functions based domestically and abroad 
selling  general  and administrative expenses also include all of our distribution center and fulfillment costs  including receiving and inspection costs that we do not include in cost of goods sold  which are comprised primarily of headcount related costs at our own distribution centers 
receiving and inspection costs and warehousing costs are excluded from our gross margins and  therefore  our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other companies that choose to include certain of these costs in cost of goods sold 
fluctuations in selling  general and administrative expenses result primarily from changes in media and advertising expenditures  changes in fulfillment costs  which increase proportionately with net sales  changes in boutique operating costs  which are affected by the number of stores opened in a period  and changes in corporate costs such as for headcount and infrastructure to support our operations 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expect to continue to invest in our corporate infrastructure  particularly related to boutiques and international  and increased legal and accounting costs and higher insurance premiums 

table of contents depreciation and amortization includes charges for the depreciation of property and equipment and the amortization of intangible assets 
we anticipate that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to open new boutiques  invest in information systems and amortize intangible assets in connection with our acquisition 
we record our depreciation and amortization as a separate line item in our statement of operations because all of this expense relates to selling  general and administrative costs 
stock based compensation includes charges incurred in recognition of compensation expense associated with grants of stock options restricted stock and stock purchases 
we account for stock based compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is applicable to stock based awards exchanged for employee services and in certain circumstances for board service by our nonemployee directors 
pursuant to sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
we record our stock based compensation on a separate operating expense line item in our statement of operations due to the fact that  to date  all of our stock based awards have been made to employees whose salaries are classified as selling  general and administrative costs 
we anticipate that our stock based compensation expense will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to grant additional stock based compensation awards 
as of december   we had options to purchase  shares of our common stock outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of per share   shares of which were exercisable at december  interest expense includes interest costs associated with our credit facilities  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreement  and the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with these credit facilities 
we anticipate that our interest expense in the future will decrease in absolute terms and as a percentage of net sales as we continue to make scheduled payments of our outstanding indebtedness 
provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products 
historically  we have only been subject to taxation in the united states  but as we have expanded our international operations we have become subject to foreign taxation at varying statutory rates 
therefore  our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly 
for fiscal  we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately of our income before provision for income taxes  excluding the impact of discrete items 
our fiscal year end is the sunday closest to december based on a week year 
each fiscal year consists of four week quarters  with an extra week added onto the fourth quarter every five or six years 
the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   each contained weeks

table of contents liquidity sources  requirements and contractual cash requirement and commitments we believe that cash flow from operations  cash on hand and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs and planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to invest in making improvements to our information technology systems

we anticipate that our capital expenditures in the year ending january  will be approximately million 
our ability to fund our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements  depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions  including the limited availability of capital in light of the current financial crisis  and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
contractual commitments we lease retail stores  warehouses  corporate offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through january portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the tables below based on their respective us dollar exchange rates as of december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
as of december   the scheduled maturities of our long term contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period years years after years total amounts in millions operating leases  net of sublease income principal payments on long term debt  including the current portion interest payments on long term debt  including the current portion minimum royalties under licensing arrangements purchase obligations total for purposes of the table  interest expense is calculated after giving effect to our interest rate swap as follows i during the remaining eight month term of the swap agreement  interest expense is based on million of our first lien term loan and based on the fixed rate of the swap of plus a margin of and interest expense on the remaining amount of the loan is estimated based on the rate in effect as of december  and ii after the remaining eight month term of the swap agreement  interest expense on the loan is estimated for all periods based on the rate in effect as of december  a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt  including the effect of the interest rate swap  would result in a change of million in our total interest payments  of which million would be in years and million would be in years purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
agreements that are cancelable without penalty have been excluded 
we are also party to a sublicense agreement for use of certain patents associated with certain of our mineral based skin care products 
the agreement requires that we pay a quarterly royalty of of the net sales of these skin care products up to the date of the last to expire licensed patent rights 
this sublicense also requires minimum annual royalty payments of approximately million for and thereafter 
the minimum annual 
table of contents royalty payments have not been included in the schedule of long term contractual obligations above as we can terminate the agreement at any time with six months written notice 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin on january  as of december   we had approximately million of total unrecognized tax benefits 
as of december   the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate was million 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities 
effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash and receivables  are not significantly affected by inflation because they are short term in nature 
our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of inventory  intangible assets  goodwill and prepaid expenses and other assets  are not currently significantly affected by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our cost of goods sold and expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of the products offered by us 
in addition  an inflationary environment could materially increase the interest rates on our debt and reduce consumer s discretionary spending 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and  as such  requires the use of judgment 
actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and the assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
we record revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize sales when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to wholesale customers except in the case of consignment sales  including those to qvc  infomercial customers and online shopping customers  or when purchased by consumers at company owned boutiques  each net of estimated returns 
for our consignment sales to qvc  we recognize sales  net of estimated returns  upon shipment to their customers 
postage and handling charges billed to customers are also recognized as revenue upon shipment of the related merchandise 
state and local taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider ourselves a pass through conduit for collecting and remitting state and local sales taxes 
shipping terms are fob shipping point  and title passes to the customer at the time and place of shipment or purchase by customers at retail locations 
for consignment sales to qvc  title passes to qvc concurrent with its shipments to its customers 

table of contents sales are reported on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received  discounts and an amount established for anticipated product returns 
our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales 
this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns  estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events 
consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns 
our standard terms for retail sales  including infomercial sales and sales company owned boutiques  limit returns to approximately to days after the sale of the merchandise 
for our premium wholesale sales channel within our north america retail segment  as is customary in the beauty industry  we may allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved 
as a percentage of gross sales  returns were  and in the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their invoices to us in full 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay  aging of accounts receivable balances and our collection history with each customer 
we make estimates and judgments about the inability of customers to pay the amount they owe us  which could change significantly if their financial condition changes or the economy in general deteriorates 
inventories inventories consist of finished goods and work in process and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
work in process includes inventory in our distribution centers related to the kitting of assembly orders 
cost is determined on a weighted average basis 
we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record write downs for excess and obsolete inventories and shrinkage based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
this methodology is significantly affected by our sales forecast 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional write downs and write offs for excess or obsolete inventories may be required 
valuation of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including equipment and leasehold improvements and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
determining if such events or changes in circumstances have occurred is subjective and requires the exercise of judgment 
if we determine such events have occurred  we then determine whether such assets are recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted net cash flows 
if future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  we write down that asset to its fair value 
we make estimates and judgments about future undiscounted cash flows and fair value 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans  there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a long lived asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
our estimates of anticipated future cash flows could be reduced significantly in the future 
as a result  the carrying amount of our long lived assets could be reduced through impairment charges in the future 
additionally  changes in estimated future cash flows could result in a shortening of estimated useful lives for long lived assets including intangibles 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other purchased intangible assets have been recorded as a result of our acquisitions 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized  but rather are subject to an annual impairment test 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

table of contents we are required to perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
should certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests  we perform the impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at that date 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of our reporting units  and determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  an impairment may exist  and we must perform the second step of comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value to determine the impairment charge  if any 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit 
in addition  we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 
changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of sfas r which requires us to measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
our calculation of stock based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and assumptions  including the fair value of our common stock  future forfeitures  stock price volatility  expected life of the options and related tax effects 
prior to our initial public offering  our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on a number of factors  most significantly the use of periodic contemporaneous valuations performed by a third party valuation firm 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures  such as types of awards 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
expected volatility of the stock is based on a blend of our peer group in the industry in which we do business and the historical volatility of our own stock 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
in the future  our expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and  ultimately  the expense we record 
derivative financial instruments we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they are measured at fair value 
the fair value is estimated based on broker price quotations using market prices for those or similar instruments and represents the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive to terminate the contract 
such quotes are assessed for reasonableness utilizing discounted cash flow analyses 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past results of operations and our forecast of 
table of contents future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we have operations 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized on a more likely than not basis 
deferred tax expense results from the change in the net deferred tax asset or liability between periods 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
in connection with the adoption of fin  we changed our accounting policy and now recognize accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
these amounts were previously classified in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we are subject to routine audits by federal and state tax authorities that may result in additional tax liabilities 
several factors drive the calculation of our tax liabilities including  i the expiration of various statutes of limitations  ii changes in tax law and regulations  iii issuance of tax rulings  and iv settlements with tax authorities 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments in our liabilities  which would impact our reported financial results 
new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no

question of section d 
of topic expresses the views of the staff regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla share options and allows usage of the simplified method for share option grants prior to december  sab allows public companies which do not have historically sufficient experience to provide a reasonable estimate to continue to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term of plain vanilla share option grants after december  we adopted sab on december  we are continuing to use the simplified method until we have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate of expected term in accordance with sab in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
statement r will significantly change the accounting for future business combinations after adoption 
statement r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquired business 
statement r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the 
table of contents business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
statement r is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we will adopt statement r beginning in our fiscal year ending january   as required 
we are currently in the process of determining the impact  if any  of adopting the provisions of statement r 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement amends and expands the disclosure requirements of statement with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement and its related interpretations and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
we will adopt statement in its fiscal year ending january   as required 
we have not completed our evaluation of statement but it will not impact our financial position or results of operations as it is disclosure only in nature 
selected quarterly results of operations the following selected quarterly data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under our credit facilities 
we have reduced our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by entering into an interest rate swap agreement covering a portion of our variable rate debt 
in august  we entered into a two year interest rate swap transaction under our senior secured credit facilities 
the interest rate swap had an initial notional amount of million which declined to million after one year under which  on a net settlement basis  we will make monthly fixed rate payments at the rate of and the counterparty makes monthly floating rate payments based upon one month us dollar libor 
our weighted average borrowings outstanding during the year ended december  were million and the annual effective interest rate for the period was  after giving effect to the interest swap agreement 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a million change to our interest expense in the year ended december   excluding the effect of the interest rate swap 
foreign currency risk most of our sales  expenses  assets  liabilities and cash holdings are currently denominated in us dollars but a portion of the net revenues we receive from sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  portions of our costs of goods sold and other operating expenses are incurred by our foreign operations and denominated in local currencies 
while fluctuations in the value of these net revenues  costs and expenses as measured in us dollars have not materially affected our results of operations historically  we cannot assure you that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material impact in the future 
in addition  our balance sheet reflects non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities which can be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we do not currently hedge against foreign currency risks
