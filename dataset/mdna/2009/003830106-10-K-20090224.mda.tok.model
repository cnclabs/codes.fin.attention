item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition  results of continuing operations  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
see financial statements in item general we are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the development and production of oil and gas 
historically  we have grown through the acquisition and subsequent development and exploration of producing properties  principally through the redevelopment of old fields utilizing new technologies such as modern log analysis and reservoir modeling techniques as well as d seismic surveys and horizontal drilling 
as a result of these activities  we believe that we have a number of development opportunities on our properties 
in addition  we intend to expand upon our development activities with complementary exploration projects in our core areas of operation 
success in our development and exploration activities is critical in the maintenance and growth of our current production levels and associated reserves 
while we have attained positive net income from continuing operations in four of the last five years  there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our financial results depend upon many factors which significantly affect our results of operations including the following the sales prices of oil and gas  the level of total sales volumes of oil and gas  the availability of  and our ability to raise additional capital resources and provide liquidity to meet  cash flow needs  the level of and interest rates on borrowings  and the level and success of exploration and development activity 

table of contents commodity prices and hedging activities 
the results of our operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for our oil and gas production 
the prices we receive for our production are dependent upon spot market prices  price differentials and the effectiveness of our derivative contracts  which we sometimes refer to as hedging arrangements 
substantially all of our sales of oil and gas are made in the spot market  or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices  and not pursuant to long term  fixed price contracts 
accordingly  the prices received for our oil and gas production are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control 
significant declines in prices for oil and gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
recently  the prices of oil and gas have been volatile 
during the first half of  prices for oil and gas were sustained at record or near record levels 
supply and geopolitical uncertainties resulted in significant price volatility during the remainder of with both oil and gas prices weakening 
during  oil prices remained strong while gas prices began strong but weakened during the course of the year 
during the first half of  prices for oil and gas were sustained at record or near record levels  however during the second half of  and subsequently  there has been a significant drop in prices 
new york mercantile exchange nymex futures price for west texas intermediate wti oil averaged per barrel for wti oil ended at per barrel 
nymex henry hub futures price for gas averaged per million british thermal units mmbtu during and ended the year at 
subsequent to the end of the prices for oil and gas have continued to decline 
as of february  the nymex futures price for west texas intermediate wti oil was per barrel and nymex henry hub futures price for gas was per million british thermal units mmbtu 
if commodity prices continue to decline  our revenue and cash flow from operations could also decline 
in addition  lower commodity prices could also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
the current global recession has had a significant impact on commodity prices and our operations 
if commodity prices remain depressed our revenues  profitability and cash flow from operations may decrease which could cause us to alter our business plans  including reducing our drilling activities 
the decline in commodity prices has also resulted in downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves at december  for we incurred a ceiling limitation write down under applicable accounting rules 
under these rules  if the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties exceed the pv of our reserves  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
as of december   the company s net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the present value of its estimated proved reserves by million million for abraxas petroleum properties and million for the partnership properties 
these amounts were calculated considering year end prices of per bbl for oil and per mcf for gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for each of our oil and gas reserves compared to each of the full cost pools 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholder s equity and earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher gas and oil prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
the realized prices that we receive for our production differ from nymex futures and spot market prices  principally due to basis differentials which are dependent on actual delivery location  adjustments for btu content  and gathering  processing and transportation costs 
during  differentials averaged per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas compared to per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas in we experienced greater differentials during compared to prior years because of the increased percentage of our production from the rocky mountain and mid continent regions which experience higher differentials than our texas properties 
approximately of our production during was from our rocky mountain and mid continent properties 
historically  these regions have experienced wider differentials than our permian basin and gulf coast properties 
as the percentage of our production from the rocky mountain and mid continent regions 
table of contents increases  we expect that our consolidated price differentials will also increase 
increases in the differential between the benchmark prices for oil and gas and the wellhead price we receive could significantly reduce our revenues and our cash flow from operations 
under the terms of the partnership s credit facility  abraxas energy partners was required to enter into derivative contracts for specified volumes  which equated to approximately of the estimated oil and gas production through december  from its estimated net proved developed producing reserves 
at december  and continuing through december  the partnership has nymex based fixed price commodity swaps covering approximately of its estimated oil and gas production from its estimated net proved developed producing reserves at volume weighted average prices of per barrel of oil and per mmbtu of gas 
the partnership intends to enter into derivative contracts in the future to reduce the impact of price volatility on its cash flow 
by removing a significant portion of price volatility on its future oil and gas production  the partnership believes it will mitigate  but not eliminate  the potential effects of changing commodity prices on its cash flow from operations for those periods 
however  when prevailing market prices are higher than our contract prices  we will not realize increased cash flow on the portion of the production that has been hedged 
we have sustained and in the future will sustain realized and unrealized losses on our derivative contracts if market prices are higher than our contract prices 
conversely  when prevailing market prices are lower than our contract prices  we will sustain realized and unrealized gains on our derivative contracts 
for example  in  the partnership sustained an unrealized loss of million and a realized gain of million 
in  the partnership incurred a realized loss of million and an unrealized gain of million 
we have not designated any of these derivative contracts as a hedge as prescribed by applicable accounting rules 
the following table sets forth our derivative position at december  period covered product volume production per day fixed price year gas  mmbtu year oil  bbl year gas  mmbtu year oil bbl year gas  mmbtu year oil bbl at december   the aggregate fair market value of our oil and gas derivative contracts was an asset of approximately million 
production volumes 
because our proved reserves will decline as oil and gas are produced  unless we find  acquire or develop additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  our reserves and production will decrease 
approximately of the estimated ultimate recovery of abraxas and of the partnership s  or of our consolidated proved developed producing reserves as of december  had been produced 
based on the reserve information set forth in our reserve estimates as of december   abraxas average annual estimated decline rate for its net proved developed producing reserves is during the first five years  in the next five years  and approximately thereafter 
based on the reserve information set forth in our reserve estimates as of december   the partnership s average annual estimated decline rate for its net proved developed producing reserves is during the first five years  in the next five years and approximately thereafter 
these rates of decline are estimates and actual production declines could be materially higher 
while abraxas has had some success in finding  acquiring and developing additional revenues  abraxas has not always able to fully replace the production volumes lost from natural field declines and prior property sales 
for example  in  abraxas replaced only of the reserves it produced 
in  however  we replaced of the reserves we produced and in  we replaced of the reserves we produced primarily as a result of the st 
mary property acquisition in january our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the near future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploration and development projects 
please see results of operations selected operation data for a presentation of our production levels for the three years 

table of contents we had capital expenditures during of million including million for the st 
mary property acquisition that closed in january  capital expenditures in also included approximately million for the acquisition of our corporate headquarters building 
we have a capital budget for of approximately million  of which million is applicable to abraxas and million applicable to the partnership 
under the terms of the partnership credit facility  the partnership s capital expenditures may not exceed million prior to the termination of the partnership s subordinated credit agreement 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources long term indebtedness subordinated credit agreement 
the final amount of our capital expenditures for will depend on our success rate  production levels  the availability of capital and commodity prices 
the following table presents historical net production volumes for the years ended december   and year ended december  total production mmcfe average daily production mcfepd availability of capital 
as described more fully under liquidity and capital resources below  abraxas sources of capital going forward will primarily be cash from operating activities  funding under the credit facility  cash on hand  distributions from the partnership and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  proceeds from the sale of properties 
abraxas energy partners principal sources of capital will be cash from operating activities  borrowings under the partnership credit facility  and sales of debt or equity securities if available to it 
at december   abraxas had approximately million of availability under the credit facility and the partnership had approximately million of availability under the partnership credit facility 
additionally the partnership s subordinated credit agreement matures on july  the partnership has intended to repay its indebtedness under the subordinated credit agreement with proceeds from its initial public offering 
however  the equity capital markets have been negatively affected in recent months 
as a result  we cannot assure you that the partnership will be successful in completing the ipo prior to the maturity of the subordinated credit agreement 
abraxas energy is currently in discussions with soci t g n rale to amend the existing senior secured credit facility and or the subordinated credit agreement in the event the ipo is not completed by april  the partnership has also entered into discussions with other lending institutions to re finance the million currently outstanding on the subordinated credit agreement 
while the company believes that there are options to this short term maturity requirement  there are no guarantees that any of these options will be successfully implemented 
exploration and development activity 
we believe that our high quality asset base  high degree of operational control and inventory of drilling projects position us for future growth 
our properties are concentrated in locations that facilitate substantial economies of scale in drilling and production operations and more efficient reservoir management practices 
at december   we operated properties accounting for approximately of our pv  giving us substantial control over the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures 
we have identified additional drilling locations of which were classified as proved undeveloped at december  on our existing properties  the successful development of which we believe could significantly increase our production and proved reserves 
over the five years ended december   we drilled or participated in drilling gross net wells of which resulted in commercially productive wells 
our future oil and gas production  and therefore our success  is highly dependent upon our ability to find  acquire and develop additional reserves that are profitable to produce 
the rate of production from our oil and gas properties and our proved reserves will decline as our reserves are produced unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  conduct successful development and exploration activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we cannot assure you that our exploration and development activities will result in increases in our proved reserves 
in  for example  abraxas replaced only of the reserves it produced 
in  however  we replaced of our reserves  and in  we replaced of our reserves  primarily as the result of the st 
mary property acquisition in january if our proved reserves decline in the future  our production may also decline and  consequently  our cash flow from operations  distributions of available cash from the partnership to abraxas and the amount that abraxas is able to borrow under its credit facility and that the partnership will be able to borrow under its credit facility will also decline 
in addition  approximately of abraxas and of the partnership s estimated proved reserves at december  were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
we may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves  in which case our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
borrowings and interest 
abraxas energy partners had indebtedness of approximately under the partnership credit facility and million under its subordinated credit agreement as of december  at december  the partnership had million available under its partnership credit facility 
at december   abraxas had availability of million under its credit facility 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance under this facility 
if interest expense increases as a result of higher interest rates or increased borrowings  more cash flow from operations would be used to meet debt service requirements 
as a result  we would need to increase our cash flow from operations in order to fund the development of our numerous drilling opportunities which  in turn  will be dependent upon the level of our production volumes and commodity prices 
in order to mitigate its interest rate exposure  the partnership entered into an interest rate swap  effective august   to fix its floating libor based debt 
the partnership s two year interest rate swap arrangement for million at a fixed rate of expires on august  this interest rate swap was amended in february lowering the partnership s fixed rate to 
results of operations selected operating data 
the following table sets forth certain of our operating data for the periods presented 
average prices reflect realized prices including the impact of hedging activities 
years ended december  dollars in thousands  except per unit data 
operating revenue oil sales gas sales rig and other total operating revenues operating income loss oil production mbbls gas production mmcf average oil sales price per bbl average gas sales price per mcf revenue is after the impact of hedging activities 
operating loss in includes million proved property impairment 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from oil and gas sales increased by million from million in to million in the increase in revenue was due to increased production volumes in as compared to as well as higher oil and gas prices realized in as compared to the increase in production volumes contributed million 
table of contents to revenue while increased commodity prices contributed million to oil and gas production revenue 
oil production volumes increased from mbbls for the year ended december  to mbbls for the same period of the increase in oil sales volumes was primarily due to production from properties acquired in the st 
mary acquisition that closed on january  production for the year ended december  from these properties added mbbls of oil 
gas production volumes increased from  mmcf for the year ended december  to  mmcf for the same period of the properties acquired in the st 
mary acquisition contributed  mmcf of gas production during the year  which was partially offset by natural field declines 
average sales prices in  before realized gain loss on derivative contracts were per bbl of oil  and per mcf of gas 
average sales prices in  before realized gain loss on derivative contracts were per bbl of oil  and per mcf of gas 
lease operating expense and production taxes 
lease operating expense  or loe  increased from million in to million in the increase in loe was primarily due to the properties acquired from st 
mary in january of as well as an increase in ad valorem and severance taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased from million in to million in loe related to the properties acquired in the st 
mary property acquisition added million to loe during loe on a per boe basis for the year ended december  was per boe compared to for the same period of the increase in per boe cost was attributable to the increase in the number of oil wells as a result of the st 
mary acquisition  which are generally more expensive to operate than gas wells  as well as the overall increase in costs 
g a expense 
general and administrative  or g a expense  excluding stock based compensation increased from million in to million in the increase in g a was primarily due to higher personnel expenses associated with additional staff added to manage the properties acquired from st 
mary 
g a expense on a per boe basis was for compared to for the same period of the per boe decrease was attributable to the higher g a expense being offset by higher production volumes during as compared to stock based compensation 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
options granted to employees and directors are valued at the date of grant and expense is recognized over the options vesting period 
for the year ended december  and  stock based compensation was approximately  and million respectively 
dd a expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization  or dd a  expense increased from million in to million in the increase in dd a was primarily the result of increased production as well as an increase in the depletion base as a result of the st 
mary acquisition 
our dd a expense on a per boe basis for was per boe as compared to per boe in the increase in the per boe basis was due to the increased production volumes in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in compared to million for in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the increase in long term debt incurred by the partnership as a result of the st 
mary acquisition 
the partnerships debt as of december  was million compared to million as of december  income taxes 
no current or deferred income tax expense or benefit has been recognized due to losses or loss carryforwards and valuation allowance  which has been recorded against such benefits 
income loss from derivative contracts 
we account for derivative contract gains and losses based on 
table of contents realized and unrealized amounts 
the realized derivative gains or losses are determined by actual derivative settlements during the period 
unrealized gains and losses are based on the periodic mark to market valuation of derivative contracts in place 
our derivative contract transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting as prescribed by sfas  therefore  fluctuations in the market value of the derivative contracts are recognized in earnings during the current period 
abraxas energy partners has entered into a series of nymex based fixed price commodity swaps  the estimated unearned value of which was an asset of approximately million as of december  for the year ended december   the partnership realized a loss of million related to these oil and gas derivatives  and an unrealized gain of million 
this compares to an unrealized loss of million and a realized gain of million in other expense 
for the year ended december  as the result of the exchange and registration rights agreement whereby partnership unitholders  under certain circumstances can convert their partnership units into abraxas common stock  the company has recognized an expense of million  including approximately  relating to shares converted during the fourth quarter and million representing the fair value of potential conversions 
this expense is included in other expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the exchange and registration rights agreement 
in august of  the partnership entered into an interest rate swap  effective august   to fix its floating libor based debt 
the partnership s two year interest rate swap arrangement is for million at a fixed rate of 
the arrangement expires on august  for the year ended december   the partnership realized a loss of approximately  related to this derivative and an unrealized loss of million 
the estimated unearned value of this agreement was a liability of million as of december  this interest rate swap was amended in february lowering the partnership s fixed rate to 
ceiling limitation write down 
we record the carrying value of our oil and gas properties using the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this method  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under the full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less related deferred taxes  are limited by country  to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost ceiling  defined as the sum of the present value of estimated unescalated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less related income taxes 
if the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties exceeds the ceiling limit  we are subject to a ceiling limitation write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling limitation write down is a charge to earnings which does not impact cash flow from operating activities 
however  such write downs do impact the amount of our stockholders equity 
the cost ceiling represents the present value discounted at of net cash flows from sales of future production  using commodity prices on the last day of the quarter  or alternatively  if prices subsequent to that date have increased  a price near the periodic filing date of the our financial statements 
as of december   our net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the present value of our estimated proved reserves by million million on abraxas petroleum properties and million on the partnership properties 
these amounts were calculated considering year end prices of per bbl for oil and per mcf for gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for our oil and gas reserves as compared to each of the full cost pools 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas assets increases when oil and gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers or governmental action cause an abrogation of  or if we voluntarily cancel  long term contracts for our gas 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
if commodity prices decline or if any of our proved reserves are revised downward  a further write down of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties may be required 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the share of the net income loss of abraxas energy partners for the period owned by the partners other than abraxas petroleum 
additionally  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  when cumulative losses applicable to the minority interest exceed the minority interest equity capital in the entity  such excess and any further losses applicable to the 
table of contents minority interest are charged to the earnings of the majority interest 
if future earnings are recognized by the minority interest  such earnings will then be credited to the majority interest abraxas to the extent of such losses previously absorbed and any excess earnings will increase the recorded value 
for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the ceiling test impairment of the partnership s oil and gas properties  losses applicable to the minority interest exceeded the minority interest equity capital by million and  as a result  million of the minority interest loss in excess of equity was charged to earnings and was reflected as a reduction of the loss applicable to the minority interest 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from oil and gas sales decreased by million from million in to million in the decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreased production volumes in as compared to offset by higher oil and gas prices realized in as compared to lower production volumes had a negative impact of million which was partially offset by higher realized prices  excluding derivative activities  which contributed million to oil and gas revenue for the year ended december  oil sales volumes decreased from mbbls in to mbbls during the decrease in oil production was primarily due to natural field declines 
gas sales volumes decreased from bcf in to bcf in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of properties in live oak county  texas effective august   as well as natural field declines 
properties sold in contributed mmcfe during prior to their sale 
production from a permian basin well drilled and brought onto production in august produced bcf in as compared to bcf in the permian basin well  the la escalera ah well  provided approximately of our mcfe production for the year ended december  average sales prices in  before realized loss on derivative contracts were per bbl of oil  and per mcf of gas 
average sales prices in  before realized loss on derivative contracts were per bbl of oil  and per mcf of gas 
lease operating expense and production taxes 
lease operating expense  or loe  decreased from million in to million in the decrease in loe was primarily due to a decrease in ad valorem and severance taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes decreased from million in to million in the decrease was due to revisions of values of some properties resulting in a lower ad valorem tax assessment 
excluding taxes  loe increased from million in to million in this increase was due to a general increase in the cost of field services 
our loe on a per boe for the year ended december  was per boe compared to per boe in the increase on a per boe basis was primarily due to a decrease in production volumes in as compared to g a expense 
general and administrative  or g a expense  excluding stock based compensation increased from million in to million in the increase in g a expense in was primarily due to new  incremental g a costs incurred by abraxas energy partners and to higher performance bonuses in as compared to performance bonuses amounted to  in  as compared to million in our g a expense on a per boe basis increased from in to in the increase in the per boe cost was due to increased g a expense in as compared to as well as decreased production volumes in as compared to stock based compensation 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
options granted to employees and directors are valued at the date of grant and expense is recognized over the options vesting period 
for the year ended december  and  stock based compensation was approximately  and  respectively 

table of contents dd a expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization  or dd a  expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease in dd a was primarily due to increased reserves as of december  as compared to december   as well as a decrease in production volumes in as compared to our dd a expense on a per boe basis for was per boe as compared to per boe in the increase in the per boe basis was due to the decreased production volumes in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to million for the decrease in interest expense was due to the redemption of our outstanding senior secured notes and refinancing and repayment of our credit facility with wells fargo foothill in may loss on debt extinguishments 
the loss on debt extinguishment consists primarily of the call premium and interest that was paid in connection with the refinancing and redemption of our senior secured notes in may income taxes 
federal income tax and state of texas margin tax have been recognized for the year ended december  as a result of the gain on the sale of assets during the period 
no deferred income tax expense or benefit has been recognized due to losses or loss carryforwards and valuation allowance  which has been recorded against such benefits 
gain on sale of assets 
as a result of the transactions related to the formation of abraxas energy partners  we recognized a gain of million 
this gain was calculated based on the requirements of staff accounting bulletin  topic h based on the fact that we elected gain treatment as a policy and the transaction met the following criteria there were no additional broad corporate reorganizations contemplated  there was not a reason to believe that the gain would not be realized  since there is no additional capital raising transaction anticipated nor was there a significant concern about the new entity s ability to continue in existence  the share price of capital raised in the private placement was objectively determined  no repurchases of the new subsidiary s units are planned  and we acknowledge that we will consistently apply the policy  and any future transactions that might result in a loss must be recorded as a loss in the income statement 
income loss from derivative contracts 
we account for derivative contract gains and losses based on realized and unrealized amounts 
the realized derivative gains or losses are determined by actual derivative settlements during the period 
unrealized gains and losses are based on the periodic mark to market valuation of derivative contracts in place 
our derivative contract transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting as prescribed by sfas  therefore  fluctuations in the market value of the derivative contracts are recognized in earnings during the current period 
abraxas energy partners has entered into a series of nymex based fixed price commodity swaps  the estimated unearned value of which was approximately million as of december  for the year ended december   we realized a gain on these derivative contracts of million 
as of december  we incurred unrealized losses on derivative contracts of million 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the share of the net income loss of abraxas energy partners for the period owned by the partners other than abraxas petroleum 
for the year ended december   the minority interest in the net loss of the partnership was approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the oil and gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to service debt and to fund the following costs the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  acquisition of interests in additional oil and gas properties  and production and transportation facilities 
the amount of capital expenditures we are able to make has a direct impact on our ability to increase cash flow from operations and  thereby  will directly affect our ability to service our debt obligations and to continue to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties 
abraxas sources of capital going forward will primarily be cash from operating activities  funding under its credit facility  distributions from the partnership and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  proceeds from the sale of properties 
we may also seek equity capital although we may not be able to complete any equity financings on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the partnership s principal sources of capital will be cash from operating activities  borrowings under the partnership credit facility  and sales of debt or equity securities if available to it 
working capital deficit 
at december  our current liabilities of million exceeded our current assets of million resulting in working capital deficit of million 
this compares to working capital of million as of december  significant components of current liabilities as of december  consisted of trade payables of million  revenues due third parties of million  other accrued liabilities of million  current derivative liabilities of million and current maturities of long term debt of million  primarily related to the partnership s subordinated credit agreement 
the partnership has intended to repay its indebtedness under the subordinated credit agreement with proceedsfrom its initial public offering 
however  the equity capital markets have been negatively affected in recent months 
as a result  we cannot assure you that the partnership will be successful in completing the ipo prior to the maturity of the subordinated credit agreement 
the partnership has entered into discussions with the lending institutions to either extend or refinance the million in debt under its subordinated credit agreement  due july  there can be no assurance that the partnership will be successful in such negotiations 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures related to our continuing operations in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the table below sets forth the components of these capital expenditures for the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands expenditure category exploration development acquisition facilities and other total during and  capital expenditures were primarily for the development of existing properties and a deposit for the st 
mary property acquisition that closed in january during capital expenditures included million for the acquisition of the st 
mary properties and other smaller acquisitions  as well as the development of our properties 
we anticipate making capital expenditures for of million 
these anticipated expenditures are subject to adequate cash flow from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility 
the partnership anticipates making capital expenditures for of million which will be used primarily for the development of its current properties 
additionally  while the subordinated credit agreement is outstanding  the partnership s capital expenditures are limited to million 
these anticipated expenditures are subject to adequate cash flow from operations  availability under abraxas and the partnership s credit facilities and  in abraxas case  distributions of available cash from the partnership 
if these sources of funding do not prove to be sufficient  we may also issue additional shares of equity securities although we may not be able to complete equity financings on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our ability to make all of our budgeted capital expenditures will also be subject to availability of drilling rigs and other field equipment and services 
our capital expenditures could also include expenditures for the acquisition of producing properties if such opportunities arise 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on market conditions and other related economic factors 
there has been a significant decline in oil and gas prices since the second quarter of should the prices of oil and gas continue to decline and if our costs of operations continue to increase as a result of the scarcity of drilling rigs or if our production volumes 
table of contents decrease  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditures budget 
if we decrease our capital expenditures budget  we may not be able to offset oil and gas production volumes decreases caused by natural field declines and sales of producing properties  if any 
sources of capital 
the net funds provided by and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities  related to continuing operations  are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below year ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities total operating activities for the year ended december  provided million in cash compared to providing million in net income plus non cash expense items and net changes in operating assets and liabilities accounted for most of these funds  including the non cash proved property impairment of million 
financing activities provided million for the year ended december  as compared to providing million in most of the funds provided in were the proceeds of long term borrowing in connection with the acquisition of the st 
mary properties in january investing activities used million in including million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties as well as the development of our current properties 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided million in cash compared to providing million in the same period in net income plus non cash expense items and net changes in operating assets and liabilities accounted for most of these funds 
financing activities provided million for the year ended december  compared to using million for the same period of most of the funds provided in were proceeds from the issuance of common stock  proceeds from the sale of common units of the partnership and proceeds from the partnership s and abraxas credit facilities 
in  most of the funds used were for net reductions in long term borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
investing activities used million during the year ended december  compared to using million for the same period of investing activities in included million for the development of our existing properties and million for the st 
mary property acquisition that was completed in january operating activities for the year ended december  provided us with million of cash 
expenditures in of approximately primarily for the development of oil and gas properties offset by proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties of million 
financing activities used million during  of which million was provided from long term borrowing offset by million of payments on long term debt 
future capital resources 
abraxas sources of capital going forward will primarily be cash from operating activities  funding under the credit facility  cash on hand  distributions from the partnership and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  proceeds from the sale of properties 
abraxas energy partners principal sources of capital will be cash from operating activities  borrowings under the partnership credit facility  and sales of debt or equity securities  if available to it 
the credit markets are undergoing significant volatility and capacity constraints 
many financial institutions have liquidity concerns  prompting government intervention to mitigate pressure on the credit market 
our exposure to the current credit market crisis includes our credit facility  the partnership credit facility and the subordinated credit agreement and counterparty performance risk 
our credit facility and the partnership credit facility are each subject to a borrowing base 
our credit facility matures on june  and the partnership credit facility matures on january  should current credit market volatility be prolonged for several years  future extensions of credit may contain terms that are less favorable than those in our credit facility and the partnership credit facility 
the subordinated credit agreement matures on july  the partnership has intended to re pay the 
table of contents amounts due under this agreement with the proceeds of the initial public offering 
however  the equity capital markets have been negatively affected in recent months 
as a result  we cannot assure you that the partnership will be successful in completing the ipo prior to the maturity of the subordinated credit agreement 
in addition  the partnership s failure to receive million of proceeds from an equity issuance on or prior to april  would be an event of default under the subordinated credit agreement 
current market conditions also elevate concern over counterparty risks related to our commodity derivative instruments 
the partnership has all of its commodity derivative instruments with one major financial institution 
should this financial counterparty not perform  we may not realize the benefit of some of our hedges under lower commodity prices 
although these derivative instruments as well as our credit facility and the partnership credit facility expose us to credit risk  we monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparty  and we are not currently aware of any inability on the part of our counterparty to perform under our contracts 
however  we are not able to predict sudden changes in the credit worthiness of our counterparty 
oil and gas prices are also volatile and have declined significantly during the second half of and have continued to decline since the end of the year 
further  the decline in commodity prices has not been accompanied by a relative decline in the prices of goods and services that we use to drill  complete and operate our wells 
the decline in commodity prices has reduced our cash flow from operations from what it would have otherwise been 
to mitigate the impact of lower commodity prices on our cash flows  we have entered into commodity derivative contracts 
as the result of the global recession  commodity prices may stay depressed or reduce further  thereby causing a prolonged downturn  which could further reduce our cash flows from operations 
this could cause us to alter our business plans  including reducing our exploration and development plans 
our cash flow from operations will also depend upon the volume of oil and gas that we produce 
unless we otherwise expand reserves  our production volumes may decline as reserves are produced 
for example  in  abraxas replaced only of the reserves it produced 
in we replaced of the reserves we produced and in  we replaced of the reserves we produced  primarily as the result of the st 
mary property acquisition in january in the future  if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  we may sell producing properties  which could further reduce our production volumes 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful exploration and development activities  acquire additional producing properties or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we believe our numerous drilling opportunities will allow us to increase our production volumes  however  our drilling activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil and gas reservoirs will be found 
if our proved reserves decline in the future  our production will also decline and  consequently  our cash flow from operations  distributions from the partnership and the amount that we are able to borrow under our credit facilities will also decline 
the risk of not finding commercially productive reservoirs will be compounded by the fact that of abraxas petroleum s and of the partnership s total estimated proved reserves at december  were undeveloped 
for the year ended december   we expended approximately million on our exploration and development activities s and continued general well maintenance and work overs utilizing our own work over rigs contractual obligations 
we are committed to making cash payments in the future on our long term debt 
we have no off balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  
table of contents payments due in contractual obligations dollars in thousands total thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt total these amounts represent the balances outstanding under the partnership credit facility  the partnership s subordinated credit agreement and abraxas mortgage on its headquarters building 
these repayments assume that we will not draw down additional funds interest expense assumes the balances of long term debt at the end of the period and current effective interest rates 
we maintain a reserve for costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
at december   our reserve for these obligations totaled million for which no contractual commitment exist 
for additional information relating to this obligation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements

net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had  subject to the limitation discussed below  million of net operating loss carryforwards for us tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards will expire through if not utilized 
uncertainties exist as to the future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards under the criteria set forth under fasb statement no

related party transactions abraxas has adopted a policy that transactions between abraxas and its officers  directors  principal stockholders  or affiliates of any of them  will be on terms no less favorable to abraxas than can be obtained on an arm s length basis in transactions with third parties and must be approved by the vote of at least a majority of the disinterested directors 
abraxas performs general and administrative services for the partnership  such as accounting  finance  land and engineering 
the partnership currently pays us million per year  which included an adjustment of million annually as a result of the st 
mary acquisition  for performing these general and administrative services 
the amount of reimbursement is subject to annual adjustments for inflation and acquisition or other expansion adjustments 
pursuant to our operating agreements  the partnership is required to reimburse us for all direct and indirect expenses associated with operating our wells 
operating expenses are the costs incurred in the operation of producing properties 
expenses for utilities  direct labor  water injection and disposal  production taxes and materials and supplies comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
operating expenses do not include general and administrative expenses 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in oil and gas activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we have chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rate on our oil and gas properties 

table of contents at the time it was adopted  management believed that the full cost method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
however  the full cost method makes us susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
we have experienced this situation several times over the years  most recently in and the current year 
our oil and gas reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from impairment testing procedures associated with the full cost method of accounting as discussed below 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a pool by pool basis  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties and the cost of properties not being amortized  less income taxes 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are depressed 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for our gas production 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
we apply the full cost ceiling test on a quarterly basis on the date of the latest balance sheet presented 
estimates of proved oil and gas reserves 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this report were predominately based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact dd a expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
asset retirement obligations 
the estimated costs of restoration and removal of facilities are accrued 
the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense 

table of contents accounting for derivatives 
we use commodity price derivative contracts to limit our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices and interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk 
fluctuations in the market value are recognized in earnings in the current period 
statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was effective for us on january  sfas  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
we have elected out of hedge accounting as prescribed by sfas accordingly all of our derivative contracts are required to be recorded at fair value on our balance sheet  while changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts are recognized in earnings in the current period 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  our financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december  and  the net market value of our oil and gas derivatives was a liability of million and a net asset of million  respectively 
the market value of our interest rate derivative was a liability of million at december  share based payments 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
additional information about management s assumptions can be found in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
options granted to employees and directors are valued at the date of grant and expense is recognized over the options vesting period 
for the years ended december   and  stock based compensation was approximately   and million respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurements sfas no 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which provides a single definition of fair value  together with a framework for measuring it  and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets 
fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the fasb agreed to defer the effective date of statement for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
there is no deferral for financial assets and financial liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding this pronouncement 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which provides companies with an option to measure  at specified election dates  many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value 
a company that adopts sfas no 
will report unrealized gains and losses on items  for which the fair value option has been elected  in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the implementation of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
sfas no 
clarifies that a noncontrolling interest previously commonly referred to as a minority interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity and should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the presentation of the consolidated income statement has been changed by sfas no 
 and consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest is now required to be reported separately 
previously  net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest was typically reported as an expense or other deduction in arriving at consolidated net income and was often combined with other financial statement amounts 
in addition  the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent must be clearly identified  labeled  and presented in the equity in the consolidated financial statements separately from the parent s equity 
subsequent changes in a parent s 
table of contents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary should be accounted for consistently  and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity interest in the former subsidiary must be initially measured at fair value 
expanded disclosures  including a reconciliation of equity balances of the parent and noncontrolling interest  are also required 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  and earlier adoption is prohibited 
prospective application is required 
due to our investment in abraxas energy partners  the adoption of sfas no 
could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations  however we do not believe that it will have a material impact on our cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r was issued in an effort to continue the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures 
it changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
certain of these changes will introduce more volatility into earnings 
the acquirer must now record all assets and liabilities of the acquired business at fair value  and related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than the previous method of being capitalized as part of the acquisition 
sfas no 
r also impacts the annual goodwill impairment test associated with acquisitions  including those that close before the effective date of sfas no 
r 
the definitions of a business and a business combination have been expanded  resulting in more transactions qualifying as business combinations 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  and earlier adoption is prohibited 
we cannot predict the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows with respect to any acquisitions completed after december  in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
enhanced disclosures to improve financial reporting transparency are required and include disclosure about the location and amounts of derivative instruments in the financial statements  how derivative instruments are accounted for and how derivatives affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
a tabular format including the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains and losses  disclosure about credit risk related derivative features and cross referencing within the footnotes are also new requirements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application and comparative disclosures encouraged  but not required 
we have not yet adopted sfas no 
we do not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles 
unlike statement on auditing standards sas no 
 the meaning of present in conformity with gaap  fas no 
is directed to the entity rather than the auditor 
the statement is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board pcaob amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with gaap  and is not expected to have any impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 

table of contents on december   the securities and exchange commission adopted rule changes to modernize its oil and gas reporting disclosures 
the changes are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
the updated disclosure requirements are designed to align with current practices and changes in technology that have taken place in the oil and gas industry since the adoption of the original reporting requirements more than years ago 
new disclosure requirements include permitting the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
enabling companies to additionally disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors 
currently  the rules limit disclosure to only proved reserves 
allowing previously excluded resources  such as oil sands  to be classified as oil and gas reserves 
requiring companies to report on the independence and qualifications of a preparer or auditor and requiring companies to file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserve estimates or conduct a reserves audit 
requiring companies to report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than the year end price to maximize the comparability of reserve estimates among companies and mitigate the distortion of the estimates that arises when using a single pricing date 
the new requirements are effective for registration statements filed on or after january   and for annual reports on forms k and f for fiscal years ending on or after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk as an independent oil and gas producer  our revenue  cash flow from operations  other income and equity earnings and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of oil  gas and natural gas liquids 
declines in commodity prices will adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as global political and economic conditions 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
most of our production is sold at market prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
assuming the production levels we attained during the year ended december   a decline in oil and gas  prices would have reduced our operating revenue and cash flow by approximately million for the year 
hedging activity and sensitivity to achieve more predictable cash flow  we reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas 
we have and may continue to enter into derivative contracts  which we sometimes refer to as hedging arrangements  for a significant portion of our oil and gas production 
the partnership credit facility required the partnership to enter into hedging arrangements on specified volumes  which equated to approximately of the estimated projected oil and gas production from its estimated pro forma net proved developed producing reserves through december  the partnership has entered into nymex based fixed price commodity swaps on approximately of its estimated oil and gas production from its estimated net proved developed producing reserves through december  at volume weighted average prices of per barrel of oil and per mmbtu of gas 

table of contents we adopted sfas as amended by sfas and sfas under sfas  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
we record our derivative instruments using the same method  accordingly the instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the market value of the derivatives being recorded in current income 
at december   the partnership had the following derivative contracts in place period covered product volume production per day fixed price year gas  mmbtu year oil  bbl year gas  mmbtu year oil bbl year gas  mmbtu year oil bbl we expect to sustain realized and unrealized gains and losses as a result of these derivative contracts 
for the year ended december   we recognized a realized gain of million and an unrealized loss of million  and for the year ended december   we recognized a realized loss of million and an unrealized gain of million on our derivative contracts 
the realized losses for the year ended december  were the result of the contract prices for oil being significantly less than current market prices 
the unrealized gains were the result of the drastic drop in commodity prices during the second half of resulting in the contract prices for oil and gas being greater that the market price 
on december   nymex futures prices were per barrel of oil and per mmbtu of gas 
we expect to continue to sustain realized and unrealized gains on our derivative contracts if market prices continue to be less than our contract prices 
interest rate risk the partnership is subject to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under the partnership credit facility and the subordinated credit agreement 
at december   the partnership had million in outstanding indebtedness under the partnership credit facility 
outstanding amounts under the partnership credit facility bear interest at a the greater of the reference rate announced from time to time by soci t g n rale  the federal funds rate plus  and a rate determined by soci t g n rale as the daily one month libor rate plus  in each case  b  depending on the utilization of the borrowing base  or  if the partnership elects  at the london interbank offered rate plus depending on the utilization of the borrowing base 
at december   the interest rate on the facility was 
for every percentage point that the libor rate rises  our interest expense would increase by approximately million on an annual basis 
in addition the partnership had million in outstanding indebtedness under the subordinated credit agreement 
outstanding amounts under the subordinated credit agreement bear interest at a the greater of the reference rate announced from time to time by soci t g n rale  the federal funds rate plus and a rate determined by soci t g n rale as the daily one month libor offered rate  plus in each case b or  if the partnership elects  at the greater of a and b at the london interbank offered rate  in each case  plus 
at december  the interest rate on the facility was 
for every percentage point that the rate rises  our interest expense would increase by approximately  on an annual basis 
in order to mitigate our interest rate exposure  we entered into an interest rate swap  effective august   to fix our floating libor based debt 
the arrangement expires on august  the interest rate swap was amended in february lowering the partnership s fixed rate from to
