overview we are a leading provider of payroll  human resource  and benefits outsourcing solutions for small to medium sized businesses 
our payroll and human resource services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs 
our payroll services are provided through either our core payroll or major market services mms  which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs  and include payroll processing  payroll tax administration services  employee payment services  and regulatory compliance services new hire reporting and garnishment processing 
in addition to the above  our software as a service solution through the mms platform provides human resource management  employee benefits management  a time and attendance solution  online expense reporting  and applicant tracking 

table of contents our human resource services primarily include comprehensive human resource outsourcing services  which include paychex premier human resources and our professional employer organization peo  retirement services administration  health and benefits services  workers compensation insurance services  time and attendance solutions  and other human resource services and products 
we mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed 
service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients  checks or transactions per client per pay period  and utilization of ancillary services 
we also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 
our strategy is focused on achieving strong long term financial performance while providing high quality  timely  accurate  and affordable services  growing our client base  increasing utilization of our ancillary services  leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure  and expanding our service offerings 
our financial results for fiscal were affected by weak economic conditions in the united states us  the severe credit crisis in the financial markets  and extremely low investment rates of return on our funds held for clients 
the weak economy affects our ability to sell and retain clients  reduces our transaction volumes related to fewer employees in our client base  and results in lower average invested balances in our funds held for clients 
the impacts were reflected in many of our key indicators  with the most significant deterioration occurring in the three months ending may  the fourth quarter  as follows checks per client decreased for the fourth quarter and for fiscal  and are projected to decline for the year ending may  fiscal  new client sales from new business starts declined for the fourth quarter and for fiscal  clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees increased for the fourth quarter and for fiscal  average rate of return earned on our combined investment portfolios was for fiscal compared to for fiscal  and short term taxable average interest rate earned was for fiscal compared to for fiscal despite the economic pressures  we achieved service revenue growth of over the prior fiscal year as a result of our annual price increase and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll and human resource services 
we effectively managed our expenses as operating income  net of certain items  increased and improved as a percentage of service revenue to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal refer to the discussion below for further information on operating income  net of certain items 
our financial results for fiscal included the following highlights payroll service revenue increased to billion 
human resource services revenue increased to million 
total revenue increased to billion 
operating income decreased to million  as combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income decreased 
operating income  net of certain items  increased to million 
net income decreased to million 

table of contents diluted earnings per share decreased to per share 
cash flow from operations decreased to million 
dividends of million were paid to stockholders  representing of net income 
in addition to reporting operating income  a us generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure  we present operating income  net of certain items  which is a non gaap measure 
we believe operating income  net of certain items  is an appropriate additional measure  as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period 
it is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year s targets and measuring management s performance in connection with certain performance based compensation payments and awards 
operating income  net of certain items  excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal to increase the litigation reserve 
interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates  which are not within the control of management 
the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature 
it is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period 
operating income  net of certain items  is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission sec 
as such  it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and  therefore  should not be used in isolation  but in conjunction with the gaap measure 
the use of any non gaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non gaap measure used by other companies 
operating income  net of certain items  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal although we have been operating in an unprecedented economic environment during fiscal  we maintained stability in our employee base  allowing us to continue to focus on providing excellent customer service and invest in our business 
some of these investments include the following client base and increased utilization of ancillary services our client base was approximately  clients as of may  this compares with approximately  clients as of may   and approximately  clients as of may  our client base declined for fiscal  compared to growth of for fiscal and growth of for fiscal the reduction in our client base for fiscal reflects the impact of weaker economic conditions on our ability to attract and retain clients 
new client sales from new business starts decreased for fiscal compared to the prior year 
also  an increase of in clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees impacted our client retention  which was slightly below historical levels at approximately of our beginning of the fiscal year client base 
despite the challenging selling environment resulting from the weak economy  we added over  new clients during fiscal new sales revenue for mms clients was strong for fiscal  increasing just under compared to fiscal the market for mms has not been as severely impacted by the decline in new business starts 
we believe growth opportunities continue to exist in our target market of small to medium sized businesses 
accordingly  we continue to increase the size of our sales force in key areas  primarily mms and health and benefits services 
reductions are expected in certain areas of our human resource services sales force due to deceleration

ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and  therefore  are beneficial to our operating margin 
the following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings in millions as of may  payroll tax administration services penetration employee payment services penetration retirement services clients comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees served comprehensive human resource outsourcing services clients workers compensation insurance clients health and benefits services revenue service and product initiatives during fiscal  we made investments in the ongoing expansion of our portfolio of services and products 
these included strengthening our software as a service solution for our mms clients through the following enhanced the paychex time and labor online product  an internet based  integrated time and labor management system that provides clients with an easy and cost effective way to automate time and attendance processes 
introduced paychex expense manager  an integrated payroll and expense management solution to help clients control discretionary spending while giving their employees the convenience of preparing and submitting expense reports via an easy to use  secure  online tool 
in addition  other fiscal initiatives included the following enhanced our k product through the addition of auto enrollment as an optional plan feature

revenue from health and benefits services increased to million for fiscal  and is anticipated to exceed million for fiscal made necessary adjustments to proactively respond to provisions under the american recovery and reinvestment act of the economic stimulus package  particularly the making work pay income tax credit and premium assistance for cobra recipients 
our preparedness allowed us to educate and assist our clients with these regulatory changes 

table of contents business acquisitions we may supplement our growth from time to time through strategic acquisitions when opportunities arise 
in fiscal  we made immaterial acquisitions to supplement our payroll client base 
focus on customer service integral to our strategy is satisfied customers to achieve maximum client retention 
for fiscal  we received high client satisfaction results which was encouraging considering the economic pressures our clients are facing 
client retention was approximately of our beginning of the fiscal year client base 
although customer satisfaction remained strong  increases in clients going out of business or no longer having any employees  and pricing pressures from our largest direct competitor and regional payroll providers kept our client retention rate slightly below historical levels 
financial position and liquidity the current credit crisis has resulted in unprecedented volatility in the global financial markets  with diminished liquidity and increased exposure to investment losses occurring in these markets 
despite this macroeconomic environment  as of may   our financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of million and no debt 
our cash and total corporate investments have increased approximately million since may  we also believe that our investments as of may  were not other than temporarily impaired  nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other than temporary impairment 
we maintain a conservative investment strategy within our investment portfolios to maximize liquidity and protect principal 
in the current financial markets  this translates to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments  negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments 
our exposure has been minimized in the current investment environment as the result of our policies of investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and short term securities with a p ratings  and by limiting the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer 
all investments held as of may  are traded in active markets 
as of may   we had no exposure to variable rate demand notes vrdns or prime money market funds 
in september  we sold all of our holdings in these types of investments as a result of turmoil in the related markets 
no losses were recognized on these sales 
the proceeds from the sale of these investments were reinvested in us agency discount notes  which is our current primary short term investment vehicle 
we have no exposure to auction rate securities  sub prime mortgage securities  asset backed securities or asset backed commercial paper  collateralized debt obligations  enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds  or structured investment vehicles sivs 
we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations 
cash flow from operations was million for fiscal historically  we have funded our operations  capital purchases  and dividend payments from our operating activities 
it is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of may   along with projected operating cash flows  will support our normal business operations  capital purchases  and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
during fiscal  dividends paid to stockholders were of net income

table of contents outlook our current outlook for fiscal is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes 
consistent with our policy regarding guidance  our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates 
comparisons to fiscal quarters are expected to improve as fiscal progresses 
projected changes in revenue and net income for fiscal are as follows low high payroll service revenue human resource services revenue total service revenue interest on funds held for clients total revenue investment income  net net income operating income  net of certain items  as a percentage of service revenue is expected to range from to for fiscal the effective income tax rate is expected to approximate for fiscal the higher tax rate for fiscal is driven by higher state income tax rates resulting from state legislative changes 
interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal are expected to be impacted by interest rate volatility 
interest on funds held for clients will be further impacted by a projected decline in average invested balances  with most of the effect in the first half of fiscal this decline is largely the result of the economic stimulus package generating lower tax withholdings for client employees 
the federal funds rate dropped significantly in fiscal from as of may  to a range of zero to as of may  as of may   the long term investment portfolio had an average yield to maturity of and an average duration of years 
in the next twelve months  slightly less than of this portfolio will mature  and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 
based upon current interest rate and economic conditions  we expect interest on funds held for clients and investment income to decrease increase by the following amounts in the respective quarters of fiscal interest on funds held investment income  fiscal for clients net first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter under normal financial market conditions  the impact to our earnings from a basis point increase or decrease in short term interest rates would be approximately million  after taxes  for a twelve month period 
such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 
we estimate the lowest level of combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income over the next fiscal year would be approximately million 
purchases of property and equipment in fiscal are expected to be in the range of million to million

other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force  the american institute of certified public accountants  and the sec did not  or are not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
critical accounting policies note a to the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex  inc our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  future expectations  and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates 
certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period 
our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed 
the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue  and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred  which include wages  taxes  benefit premiums  and claims of peo worksite employees 
direct costs billed and incurred were billion for each of fiscal   and revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized when all of the following are present persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  typically a non cancelable sales order  delivery is complete for the software and hardware  the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions 
revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
in certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund 
we maintain an allowance for returns  which is based on historical data 
the allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 
interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services  and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 
these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to days after receipt  with some items extending to days 
the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collecting  holding  and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services 
interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities 

table of contents peo workers compensation insurance workers compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us 
these reserves include estimates for reported losses  plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 
in establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves  we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections  and is subject to change due to multiple factors  including economic trends  changes in legal liability law  and damage awards  all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers compensation insurance reserves 
adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 
such adjustments could possibly be significant  reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 
in fiscal and fiscal  workers compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred 
our maximum individual claims liability was million under both the fiscal and fiscal policies 
we had recorded the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets for workers compensation claims as of may  in millions prepaid expense current liability long term liability valuation of investments our investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value 
in determining the fair value of our available for sale securities  we utilize the interactive data pricing service  a market approach 
unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value of investments are included in comprehensive income  net of tax  as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security s cost basis 
on our consolidated statements of income  realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients  whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income  net 
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings  and short term securities with a p ratings  and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer 
we regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns  which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other things  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment  and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity 
our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of may   resulting from acquisitions of businesses 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
our business is 
table of contents largely homogeneous and  as a result  substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit 
we perform our annual review in our fiscal fourth quarter 
based on the results of our goodwill impairment review  no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal or fiscal subsequent to this review  there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 
we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
accrual for client fund losses we maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients inability to meet their payroll obligations 
as part of providing payroll  payroll tax administration services  and employee payment services  we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client s bank account for the amount of tax obligations and employees direct deposits 
electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients insufficient funds to cover such transfers 
we evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients 
contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
as of may   we had approximately million of reserves for pending litigation 
based on the application of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated  we deem this amount adequate 
the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment 
this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter 
in light of the litigation reserve recorded  we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded 
for additional information regarding pending legal matters  refer to note n in the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k 
stock based compensation costs in accordance with sfas no 
r  all stock based awards to employees  including grants of stock options  are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life 
we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility  both over a period equal to the expected option life 
we estimate expected option life based on historical exercise behavior 
under sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest 
our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience 
forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change  and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 
the assumptions of volatility  expected option life  and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior  stock price trends  and changes to type or provisions of stock based awards 
any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 
we have determined that the black scholes option pricing model  as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application  is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants 
we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model  and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value  or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 
income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under 
table of contents this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a deferred tax asset related to the stock based compensation costs recognized for certain stock based awards 
at the time of exercise of non qualified stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards  we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid in capital 
we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stock based awards 
we also maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale securities 
corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities 
as a result of our operating and investing activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer term available for sale securities 
we maintain a conservative investment strategy within our investment portfolios to maximize liquidity and protect principal 
we attempt to mitigate the risks associated with our investing activities by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and short term securities with a p ratings  limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer  and by investing in short to intermediate term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes 
we manage the available for sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one half to three years 
all investments held as of may  are traded in active markets 
as of may   we had no exposure to vrdns or prime money market funds 
in september  we sold all of our holdings of these types of investments as a result of turmoil in the related markets 
no losses were recognized on those sales 
the proceeds from the sales of these investments were reinvested in us agency discount notes  which are currently our primary short term investment option 
we have no exposure to auction rate securities  sub prime mortgage securities  asset backed securities or asset backed commercial paper  collateralized debt obligations  enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds  or structured investment vehicles sivs 
we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
during fiscal  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was compared with for fiscal and for fiscal with the turmoil currently in the financial markets  our conservative investment strategy translates to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments 
when interest rates are falling  the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and long term interest rate changes 
during a falling interest rate environment  the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our short term investments  and over time decrease earnings from our longer term available for sale securities 
earnings from available for sale securities  which as of may  had an average duration of two and one half years  would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates 
in the next twelve months  slightly less than of our available for sale portfolio will mature  and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 

table of contents the cost and fair value of available for sale securities that had stated maturities as of may  are shown below by contractual maturity 
expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 
may  in millions cost fair value maturity date due in one year or less due after one year through three years due after three years through five years due after five years total the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years federal funds rate beginning of fiscal year rate decrease increase first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter federal funds rate end of fiscal year three year aaa municipal securities yields end of fiscal year the federal funds rate was a range of zero to as of may  calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to daily interest rate changes  seasonal variations in investment balances  actual duration of short term and available for sale securities  the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments  changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates  which are not synchronized or simultaneous  and financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates 
subject to these factors  a basis point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax exempt interest rates by approximately basis points 
our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately billion for fiscal our anticipated allocation is approximately invested in short term securities and available for sale securities with an average duration of less than days  and invested in available for sale securities with an average duration of two and one half to three years 
the combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of million as of may   compared with a net unrealized gain of million as of may  during fiscal  the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of million to a net unrealized gain of million 
during fiscal  the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of 
table of contents million to a net unrealized gain of million 
the net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately million as of july  as of may  and may   we had billion and billion  respectively  invested in available for sale securities at fair value 
the weighted average yield to maturity was and  as of may  and may   respectively 
the weighted average yield to maturity excludes available for sale securities tied to short term interest rates such as the vrdns held as of may  we held no vrdns as of may  assuming a hypothetical decrease in both short term and longer term interest rates of basis points  the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of available for sale securities as of may   would be approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value 
this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio s recorded value  with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity 
these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations  unless any declines in fair value were considered to be other than temporary and an impairment loss recognized 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and short term securities with a p ratings  and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer 
we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns 
we believe that the investments we held as of may  were not other than temporarily impaired 
while certain available for sale securities had fair values that were below cost  we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms  and that the decline in the fair value was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk 
as of may  and may   the majority of the securities with an unrealized loss held an aa rating or better 
we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity 
our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment
