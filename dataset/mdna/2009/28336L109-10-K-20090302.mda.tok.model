table of contents storage projects anticipated storage capacity completion or storage project bcf description in service date black warrior storage to construct a multi cycle natural gas storage facility in monroe and lowndes counties  mississippi 
the facilities will include three  horsepower electric driven reciprocating compressor units  gas processing and dehydration units and a mile  inch pipeline that will interconnect with our system 
totem gas storage to develop a natural gas storage field that services and interconnects with the high plains pipeline having bcf of natural gas storage capacity  bcf of which will be working gas capacity  with a mmcf d maximum withdrawal rate and mmcf d maximum injection rate 
july construction of cypress phase iii is at the option of bg lng services 
this project is not fully contracted and is not included in our inventory of committed pipeline expansion projects at this time 
this joint project between us and an affiliate of psco will be operated by us and owned by wyco 
all of the working storage capacity is fully contracted with psco to cover the cost of service including a return on our investment pursuant to a firm contract through lng facilities elba island lng 
we own an lng receiving terminal located on elba island  near savannah  georgia with a peak sendout capacity of bcf d and a base load sendout capacity of bcf d 
the capacity at the terminal is contracted with subsidiaries of british gas group and royal dutch shell plc 
in september  we received ferc approval to expand the elba island lng receiving terminal and construct the elba express pipeline 
the expansion is anticipated to increase the peak sendout capacity of the terminal from bcf d to bcf d 
the elba express pipeline will consist of approximately miles of pipeline with a total capacity of bcf d  which will transport natural gas from the elba island lng terminal to markets in the southeastern and eastern united states 
gulf lng 
in february  we completed our acquisition of a percent interest in the gulf lng clean energy project  which is constructing a ferc approved lng terminal in pascagoula  mississippi with a designed sendout capacity of bcf d that is expected to be placed in service in october markets and competition our pipelines segment provides natural gas services to a variety of customers  including natural gas producers  marketers  end users and other natural gas transmission  distribution and electric generation companies 
in performing these services  we compete with other pipeline service providers as well as alternative energy sources such as coal  nuclear energy  wind  hydroelectric power  solar and fuel oil 
imported lng has been a growing supply sector of the natural gas market 
lng terminals and other regasification facilities can serve as alternate sources of supply for pipelines  enhancing their delivery capabilities and operational flexibility and complementing traditional supply transported into market areas 
however  these lng delivery systems may also compete with our pipelines for transportation of gas into the market areas we serve 

table of contents electric power generation has been a growing demand sector of the natural gas market 
the growth of natural gas fired electric power benefits the natural gas industry by creating more demand for natural gas 
this potential benefit is offset  in varying degrees  by increased generation efficiency  the more effective use of surplus electric capacity  increased natural gas prices and the use and availability of other fuel sources for power generation 
in addition  in several regions of the country  new additions in electric generating capacity have exceeded load growth and electric transmission capabilities out of those regions 
these developments may inhibit owners of new power generation facilities from signing firm transportation contracts with natural gas pipelines 
we expect growth of the natural gas market will be adversely affected by the current economic recession in the us and global economies 
the decline in economic activity will reduce industrial demand for natural gas and electricity  which will cause lower natural gas demand both directly in end use markets and indirectly through lower power generation demand for natural gas 
the demand for natural gas and electricity in the residential and commercial segments of the market will likely be less affected by the economy 
the lower demand and the credit restrictions on investments in the current environment may also slow development of supply projects 
as a result  our pipelines may experience lower throughput  lower revenues and slower development of new expansion projects 
while our pipeline systems could experience some level of reduced throughput and revenues  or slower development of expansion projects as a result of these factors  each generates a significant portion of their revenues through monthly reservation or demand charges on long term contracts at rates stipulated under our tariffs 
our existing transportation and storage contracts mature at various times and in varying amounts of throughput capacity 
our ability to extend our existing customer contracts or remarket expiring contracted capacity is dependent on competitive alternatives  the regulatory environment at the federal  state and local levels and market supply and demand factors at the relevant dates these contracts are extended or expire 
the duration of new or renegotiated contracts will be affected by current prices  competitive conditions and judgments concerning future market trends and volatility 
subject to regulatory requirements  we attempt to recontract or remarket our capacity at the maximum allowable rates allowed under our tariffs although  at times  we enter into firm transportation contracts at amounts that are less than these maximum allowable rates to remain competitive 
the extent that these amounts are less than the maximum rates varies for each of our pipeline systems 
the weighted average remaining contract term for active contracts is approximately six years

table of contents exploration and production segment our exploration and production segment s business strategy focuses on the exploration for and the acquisition  development and production of natural gas  oil and ngl in the united states  brazil and egypt 
as of december   we controlled million net leasehold acres and our proved natural gas and oil reserves at december   were approximately tcfe  which do not include tcfe related to our unconsolidated investment in four star oil and gas company four star 
during  daily equivalent natural gas production averaged approximately mmcfe d  not including mmcfe d from our equity investment in four star 
we have a balanced portfolio of development and exploration projects that include both long lived and shorter lived properties that we operate through four regions in the us and an international division 
over the past five years  we have grown our exploration and production business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives 
our acquisitions include medicine bow  which had operations in the western us along with an ownership interest in four star  peoples energy production company peoples  with operations in east and south texas  north louisiana and mississippi  and producing properties and undeveloped acreage in zapata county  texas 
supplementing these acquisitions were smaller bolt on acquisitions of incremental interests where we already had existing operations 
our organic growth has mainly focused on expanding acreage and inventory in proximity to our existing core assets 
during  as part of our efforts to high grade our asset portfolio  we completed the sale of non core properties primarily in the texas gulf coast and gulf of mexico regions 
in january  we also completed the sale of two additional non core natural gas producing properties in the western and central regions 
the combination of these transactions have increased the onshore us weighting of our existing inventory

table of contents international brazil 
our brazilian operations cover approximately  net acres in seven blocks and eight development areas in the camamu  espirito santo and potiguar basins located offshore brazil 
during  we invested million on capital projects in brazil  and production averaged mmcfe d 
our operations in each basin are described below camamu basin 
in  we retained a percent working interest in two development areas in the bm cal block  namely the camarao and pinauna fields  and relinquished the remainder of the acreage in the block 
in pinauna  we are in the process of obtaining regulatory and environmental approvals that are required to enter the next phase of development 
in october  ibama  the environmental regulatory agency in brazil  issued the terms of reference for the project to us  which represents the first major step in the environmental permitting process 
the timing of the pinauna field development will be dependent on the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and either the recovery of commodity prices or cost reductions that reflect the current low commodity price environment 
we also own an approximate percent working interest in the bm cal and bm cal blocks in the camamu basin  operated by petrobras 
in  we participated in drilling an exploratory well in the bm cal block that was unsuccessful 
we continue to evaluate other opportunities in this block 
we also participated in drilling an exploratory well in the bm cal block and found hydrocarbons 
we are currently evaluating the results and appraisal options on bm cal and plan to participate in drilling a second exploratory well in the block during espirito santo basin 
during and early  we executed a unitization agreement and gas and condensate sales agreements with petrobras to develop the camarupim field which was discovered in a unitization agreement is required to develop this field because the field extends onto a block south of the es block in which we did not own a working interest 
under the unitization agreement  we will own an approximate percent working interest in the camarupim field 
the gas sales agreement provides for a price that adjusts quarterly based on a basket of fuel oil prices  while the condensate sales agreement provides for a price that adjusts monthly based on a brent crude price less a fixed differential that will adjust annually 
the plan of development for the field includes drilling four horizontal natural gas wells 
as of december   one well has been drilled and tested and two additional wells have been spud 
we expect to complete all drilling operations and begin production from the field in the second quarter of also  in  we participated with petrobras in drilling an exploratory well in the es block in which we own a percent working interest 
hydrocarbons were found in the well and we are now evaluating the results 
the exploratory well is located north of the camarupim field 
petrobras plans to drill another exploratory well on this block during potiguar basin 
we own a percent working interest in the pescada arabaiana fields 
our production from these fields averaged approximately mmcfe d in we also own an interest in two blocks  bm pot and bm pot  in the potiguar basin where we have no proved reserves or production 
in the second quarter of  we expect to enter into an agreement with petrobras to relinquish our interest in these two blocks 
egypt 
as of december   our egyptian operations cover approximately million net acres in two blocks located primarily onshore in egypt s western desert 
during  we invested million on capital projects in egypt 
in  we completed the acquisition of seismic data on our operated south mariut block and continue to interpret the data 
in january  we completed a transaction with rwe dea ag rwe dea to swap a percent working interest in our south mariut block for an equal working interest in rwe dea s tanta block 
the tanta block contains approximately  acres and is located in the nile delta area just to the east of and adjacent to our south mariut block 
the swap with rwe dea allows us to expand our acreage position and diversify our portfolio in egypt 
we spudded our first exploratory well in the south mariut block in late january and plan to drill two to three additional exploratory wells in the south mariut block in we also own a percent non operated working interest in approximately  net acres in the south feiran concession located offshore in the gulf of suez 
during  we participated in drilling an exploratory well in the south feiran block that was unsuccessful 
we continue to evaluate other opportunities in this block

ryder scott company  lp ryder scott  an independent reservoir engineering firm that reports to the audit committee of our board of directors  conducted an audit of the estimates of percent of our consolidated proved natural gas and oil reserves as of december  the scope of the audit performed by ryder scott included the preparation of an independent estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserves estimates for fields comprising 
table of contents approximately percent of our total worldwide present value of future cash flows pretax 
the specific fields included in ryder scott s audit represented the largest fields based on value 
ryder scott also conducted an audit of the estimates of percent of the proved natural gas and oil reserves of four star  our unconsolidated affiliate 
our estimates of four star s proved natural gas and oil reserves are prepared by our internal reservoir engineers and do not reflect those prepared by the engineers of four star 
based on the amount of proved reserves determined by ryder scott  we believe our reported reserve amounts are reasonable 
ryder scott s reports are included as exhibits to this annual report on form k 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  projecting future rates of production  and projecting the timing and costs of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the reserve data represents only estimates which are often different from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is highly dependent on the quality of available data  the accuracy of the assumptions on which they are based  and on engineering and geological interpretations and judgment 
all estimates of proved reserves are determined according to the rules currently prescribed by the securities and exchange commission sec 
these rules indicate that the standard of reasonable certainty be applied to proved reserve estimates 
this concept of reasonable certainty implies that as more technical data becomes available  a positive or upward revision is more likely than a negative or downward revision 
estimates are subject to revision based upon a number of factors  including reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and government restrictions 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of that estimate 
in general  the volume of production from natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire additional properties with proved reserves  or both  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully  but future events  including commodity price changes  may cause these assumptions to change 
in addition  estimates of proved undeveloped reserves and proved non producing reserves are subject to greater uncertainties than estimates of proved producing reserves
