outsourcing trends and the current economic environment our business as a whole  and of our inventiv clinical  inventiv commercial and inventiv patient outcomes segments in particular  is related significantly to the degree to which pharmaceutical companies outsource services that have traditionally been performed internally by fully integrated manufacturers 
current economic conditions in the us and abroad make it difficult for us to predict the near term performance of our businesses 
although the pharmaceutical industry is generally regarded as non cyclical  the current recessionary environment has impacted and can be expected to further impact virtually all economic activity in the united states and abroad  including in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry  and is resulting in increased budget scrutiny and efforts to significantly reduce expenditures in all areas of our clients businesses 
during  our inventiv communications division was affected by the tentativeness of clients to make marketing spend decisions  and that trend appears to be continuing  and perhaps deepening  during as evidenced by  among other things  longer lead times by our clients in developing their marketing budgets 
we believe that our clients are intently focused on their short term spending and cost cutting efforts  and are continuing to look for ways to streamline their operations 
some clients are reducing marketing expenditures through reducing the scopes of agency projects and delaying decisions on new marketing initiatives 
the consequence  which we anticipate but cannot assure will be short to medium term in nature  is to shift the revenue opportunities for our inventiv communications division away from supporting in market products  where margins have traditionally been the most attractive 
we also believe that client budgeting constraints and reductions in overall pharmaceutical marketing expenditures may impact our inventiv patient outcomes division during an offsetting and longer term positive trend for us  however  is that our clients appear to be adopting clear strategies to outsource more of their pharmaceutical marketing expenditures in lower cost and more flexible solutions consistent with what inventiv offers 
management is addressing the challenges of the current environment by taking steps to reduce fixed costs and create more flexibility in our cost structure  maximize and conserve strong cash flow and be in a position to pay down debt over time 
cost management strategies employed by management include reducing fixed cost headcount  supplementing resources with talented flex time employees who are willing to be employed on an as needed basis  creating a studio to manage project based graphic design and production needs for agencies across the communications division  which will enable us to reduce overhead  improve the quality and speed of service to our clients and reduce our dependence on external vendors 
we believe that these steps will allow inventiv to provide competitive pricing to its clients and to improve margins 
while the current transformation in the pharmaceutical industry presents challenges to us  it also presents opportunities 
our client base is moving to more extensive outsourcing of the services we provide 
furthermore  the industry s pipeline is strong  with more compounds in phase iii development in as compared to however  we also believe that  even if the fda approval rate does not appreciably improve over time  the number of compounds awaiting approval will lead to increased overall outsourcing expenditures 
as a result of our deep and long standing relationships with our clients  we believe that we are well positioned to capture these opportunities 
regulatory uncertainty because most of our revenues are generated by businesses involved in the commercialization of pharmaceutical products  uncertainties surrounding the approval of our clients pharmaceutical products directly affect us 
the pace at which a pharmaceutical product moves through the fda approval process  and the application by the fda of standards and procedures related to clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling claims and other matters are difficult to predict and may change over time 
fda non approvals and delays in approval can significantly impact revenue  particularly in the inventiv communications segment  because of the relationship between the approval process and the amount and timing of client marketing expenditures to support the affected pharmaceutical products 
although delays in fda approval rates have negatively impacted the pharmaceutical industry  and indirectly inventiv  the new product pipeline in the industry remains strong  with many late stage products awaiting fda approval 
even if the fda approval rate does not approve  we believe that the number of products awaiting approval  and the requirement for pharmaceutical manufacturers to support these products as they reach commercialization  represents an opportunity over the medium to longer term for inventiv to capture increasing levels of outsourced services engagements 
business strategy our businesses have generated strong revenue growth for the past several years 
our internal revenue growth reflects our strong track record in winning new business  which in turn is enhanced by our pursuit of cross servicing opportunities within and across our business segments 
our revenues are generally received under contracts with limited terms and that can be terminated at the client s option on short notice 
we have been successful historically in obtaining increasing amounts of repeat business from many of our clients and in expanding the scope of the services we provide to them and thereby sustaining multi year relationships with many of our clients 
when relationships do not renew  we have been successful in redeploying personnel quickly and efficiently 
strategic acquisitions have historically been a core element of our business strategy 
acquisitions contributed significantly to our annual revenue growth over the last few years 
we expect to be more selective and execute fewer acquisitions going forward 
we will continue to evaluate our strategic position and intend to make opportunistic acquisitions that enable us to expand the scope of our service offerings and drive shareholder value 
our acquisition activity adds complexity to the analysis of period to period financial results and makes direct comparison of those financial results difficult 
our acquisitions are accounted for using purchase accounting and the financial results of the acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from their acquisitions dates 
a prior year period that ended before an acquisition was completed  however  will not include the corresponding financial results of the acquired business 
during  revenues from acquisitions totaled approximately million  of which million was in our inventiv patient outcomes segment and million in our inventiv commercial segment 
revenues from acquisitions totaled million  of which million was in our inventiv communications segment  million in our inventiv patient outcomes segment and million in our inventiv commercial segment 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the following is a summary of our revenue recognition policy  based on the segment and services we provide inventiv clinical clinical staffing and recruiting revenues are recognized and recorded when services are rendered 
functional outsourcing revenues are recognized and recorded when milestones are achieved  in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
executive placement revenues are recognized and recorded at the time a candidate begins full time employment 
any write offs due to cancellations and or billing adjustments historically have been insignificant 
inventiv communications advertising and communication support revenues are recognized and recorded under the proportional performance method  by relating the actual hours of work performed to date to the current estimated total hours of the respective projects 
any anticipated losses on projects are recognized when such losses are anticipated 
time and production billings are billed as incurred for actual time and expenses 
public relations revenues are recognized and recorded as time and production billings are billed as incurred for actual time and expenses

patient and physician education revenues are recognized and recorded using either the completed contract method or when milestones are achieved  depending on the terms of the specific contracts 
inventiv commercial inventiv selling solutions inventiv pharma teams revenues and associated costs are recognized and recorded under pharmaceutical detailing contracts based on the number of physician calls made or the number of sales representatives utilized 
most of our sales and marketing teams contracts involve two phases  an implementation phase  formerly referred to as deployment phase  typically one to three months  in which we perform initial recruiting  training and preparation for deployment of the field force at the start of a new contract  and the deployment phase  formerly referred to as promotion phase  in which our deployed field force actively promotes specified products for clients through face to face interactions with physicians or other targets referred to as detailing 
our inventiv pharma teams contracts specify a separate fee for the initial implementation phase of a project 
we consider the implementation phase to be a separate and distinct earnings process and recognize the related revenues throughout the implementation phase  which typically spans a period of one to three months at the beginning of the first year of a contract 
we generally recognize revenue during the deployment phase of our inventiv pharma teams contracts on a straight line basis based on the size of the deployed field force 
the accounting for the two phases is based on our analysis of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in which we have concluded that the deployment and promotion phases are being sold separately and therefore qualify as separate units of accounting within the meaning of paragraph of eitf many of the product detailing contracts allow for additional periodic incentive fees to be earned once agreed upon performance benchmarks have been attained 
revenue from incentive fees is recognized and recorded when we are reasonably assured that payment will be made  and is typically based upon verification through calculation of achievement  third party data or client verification 
many contracts also stipulate penalties if agreed upon performance benchmarks have not been met 
these penalties are recognized upon verification of performance shortfalls 
non refundable conversion fees are recognized and recorded as revenue when one of our sales professionals accepts a firm offer of permanent employment from a customer during the term of a contract 
recruiting revenues are recognized based on placement of candidates 
professional development and training revenues are generally recognized and recorded as training courses are completed

virtual event services revenues are recognized based on the frequency and upon completion of live events 
sales force automation data analysis a majority of revenues are recognized based on straight line basis 
for certain analytics projects  revenues are recognized upon completion 
inventiv strategy and analytics planning and analytics revenues for hpr generally include fixed fees  which are recognized and recorded when monthly services are performed based on the proportional performance method and when payment is reasonably assured 
hpr s initial contracts typically range from one month to one year

certain contracts are also recorded based on the proportional performance method 
product access and managed market support consulting fee revenues are recognized and recorded when services are rendered 
other services are based on milestones 
consulting and contract marketing revenues are recognized and recorded on a fee for service basis  in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
inventiv patient outcomes patient pharmaceutical compliance programs revenues are mainly recognized based on the volume of correspondence sent to patients 
patient support programs patient assistance programs revenues depend on the number of patients served and are recognized and recorded as each service is performed 
clinical nurse educators  on call specialists  and medical science liaison programs revenue recognition is the same as inventiv pharma teams  as the two services are similar in the business arrangement and fee structure 
medical cost containment and consulting solutions the majority of revenues are recognized on a completed contract basis  based on an analysis of claims as a percentage of savings realized by our clients 
certain services are performed on a fee for services basis and recognized when the service is rendered 
patient relationship marketing revenues are recognized and recorded as time and production billings are billed as incurred for actual time and expenses 
general revenue recognition reimbursable costs reimbursable costs  including those relating to travel and out of pocket expenses  sales force bonuses tied to individual or product revenues  and other similar costs  are generally included in revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in costs of services in the period in which such amounts have been finalized 
in certain cases  based on our analysis of eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and related accounting literature  we may also record certain reimbursable transactions  such as the placement of media advertisements where we act as an agent  as net revenues 
loss contracts we periodically analyze our contracts to determine the likelihood and amount of any potential loss on a contract resulting from lower than anticipated product  field force or other performance 
in the event that current information illustrates a loss is likely to be incurred over the remaining life of the contract  we accrue that loss at the time it becomes probable 
we did not have any material loss contracts in or billing customers are invoiced according to agreed upon billing terms 
contracts that are invoiced prior to performance of related services are recorded as client advances and unearned revenue and are not recognized as revenues until earned  in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
amounts earned for revenues recognized before the agreed upon invoicing terms have been met are recorded as revenue and included in unbilled services 
upon billing  these amounts are transferred to billed accounts receivable 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles are assessed for potential impairment pursuant to the guidelines of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis at june or when management determines that the carrying value of goodwill or an indefinite lived intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of certain indicators of impairment 
we applied aggregation criteria consistent with the definitions under sfas  as well as the related guidance in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  for purposes of aggregating business units in our goodwill impairment testing 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
we calculate and compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
if we deem the useful life to be no longer indefinite after testing for impairment in accordance with the applicable rules stated above  we amortize the intangible asset over its remaining estimated useful life  following the pattern in which the expected benefits will be consumed or otherwise used up and we continue to review for impairment on an annual basis 
we performed annual impairment tests as of june  and concluded that the existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible tradename balances were not impaired 
in conjunction with the preparation  review and audit of financial statements for our fiscal year  as a result of adverse economic and equity market conditions that caused a decrease in the current marketplace and related multiples and our stock price  we concluded that a triggering event had occurred indicating potential impairment  and accordingly we performed an impairment test of our goodwill and other intangible assets at december  this interim impairment test resulted in pre tax noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of approximately million  including million of indefinite lived assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and million of definite lived assets under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of or disposal of long lived assets 
claims and insurance accruals we maintain self insured retention limits for certain insurance policies 
the liabilities associated with the risk we retain are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis  demographics  nature and severity  past experience and other assumptions  which have been consistently applied 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation and auto liability claims and estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience with respect to all other liabilities 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  the actual liabilities could vary materially from management s estimates and assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
management believes that these reserves are adequate 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income of a specific nature prior to the expiration of any loss carryforwards or capital losses 
the asset may be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
in addition  we maintain reserves for certain tax items  which are included in income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheet 
we periodically review these reserves to determine if adjustments to these balances are necessary 
derivative financial instruments we enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding long term debt 
at hedge inception  and at least quarterly thereafter  we assess whether derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item 
to the extent the instruments are considered to be effective  changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings interest expense 
the fair values of our interest rate swaps are obtained from dealer quotes 
these values represent the estimated amount we would receive or pay to terminate the agreement taking into consideration the difference between the contract rate of interest and rates currently quoted for agreements of similar terms and maturities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk long term debt exposure at december   we had million debt outstanding under our secured term loan as described in liquidity and capital resources in item above 
we will incur variable interest expense with respect to our outstanding loan 
this interest rate risk may be partially offset by our derivative financial instrument  as described below 
based on our debt obligation outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the variable interest rate would have an immaterial effect on interest expense due to the fixed rate associated with the derivative financial instrument 
derivative financial instrument effective october  we entered into an amortizing three year interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of million to fix the interest rate on the six year million loan arrangement entered into to facilitate the acquisition of inventiv communications  inc we entered into this interest rate swap agreement to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt 
from october to july  we did not designate our original swap arrangement for hedge accounting and recorded an approximate million reduction to interest expense relating to the mark to market adjustment  and a corresponding derivative asset for approximately million  which was recorded in deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the swaps represent the estimated amount we would receive or pay to terminate the agreement taking into consideration the difference between the contract rate of interest and rates currently quoted for agreements of similar terms and maturities 
on july   we formally designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge pursuant to sfas no 
we employed the dollar offset method to assess effectiveness by performing a sensitivity analysis and utilized the hypothetical derivative method under dig issue g to measure ineffectiveness 
the hypothetical derivative contains the same terms and conditions as the debt agreement with an inception date of july  the hypothetical swap had a fair value of zero on the date of designation and the hedging swap had a fair value of million on the date of designation 
as the swap fair value declined to zero at maturity  which was december   the million of fair value was recognized in earnings over the remaining life of the swap as part of the ineffectiveness calculation 
during the year ended december   the fair market value of the original derivative asset increased from a liability of approximately million to the maturity value of approximately million was recorded as interest expense  attributable to the financing component embedded within the interest rate swap  while million million  net of taxes was recorded as an increase to other comprehensive income 
on september   we entered into a new amortizing five year interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of million at hedge inception  with an accretive notional amount increase to million effective december  to hedge the total outstanding debt notional  as our original three year interest rate swap arrangement described above expired 
at hedge inception  we employed the dollar offset method by performing a sensitivity analysis to assess effectiveness and utilized the hypothetical derivative method under dig issue g to measure ineffectiveness 
the hypothetical derivative contains the same terms and conditions as the debt agreement 
as a result of the hypothetical derivative method  there was no ineffectiveness for the period ended december   and accordingly  million million  net of taxes was recorded as a decrease to other comprehensive income and an increase to other non current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
this change in other comprehensive income includes the million credit value adjustment as discussed in note foreign currency exchange rate exposure we are not currently affected by foreign currency exchange rate exposure  except for any fluctuations in the foreign bank accounts remaining from the divestitures of our european business units  from continuing operations of our uk  france and canadian subsidiaries and equity investments and minority interests in our foreign business units  which are not material to our consolidated financial statements 
our treatment of foreign subsidiaries is consistent with the guidelines set forth in sfas  foreign currency translations 
the financial statements of our subsidiaries expressed in foreign currencies are translated from the respective functional currencies to us dollars  with results of operations and cash flows translated at average exchange rates during the period  and assets and liabilities translated at end of the period exchange rates 
at december   the accumulated other comprehensive losses related to foreign currency translations was approximately million
