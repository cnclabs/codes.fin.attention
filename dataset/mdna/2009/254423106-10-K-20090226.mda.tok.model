you should read the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in with the name ihop corp 
effective june   the name of the company was changed to dineequity  inc the company  we or our 
the first international house of pancakes ihop restaurant opened in in toluca lake  california 
shortly thereafter we began developing and franchising additional restaurants 
in november  we completed the acquisition of applebee s international  inc applebee s which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
we own and operate two restaurant concepts in the casual dining and family dining niches applebee s neighborhood grill and bar and ihop 
reference herein to applebee s and ihop restaurants are to those franchise operated restaurants and company operated restaurants 
sales of restaurants that are owned by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the company 
with more than  restaurants combined  we are one of the largest full service restaurant companies in the world 
key overall strategies we are in the early stages of a multi year revitalization process for the applebee s brand as outlined below and have been focused on both stabilizing the business and building the foundation for growth in and beyond  a foundation similar to that from which ihop has demonstrated consistent growth 
we will seek to enhance shareholder value by executing the following business strategies for applebee s and ihop restaurants 
applebee s key strategies franchise company operated restaurants and sell owned real estate we have made significant progress in implementing our strategy to franchise our company operated restaurants and sell our owned real estate resulting in a less capital intensive development model 
during  we completed the sale leaseback of  or of our fee owned  company operated restaurants resulting in cash proceeds used to reduce debt by million  franchised restaurants in the california  nevada  delaware and texas markets resulting in cash proceeds used to reduce debt by million  and completed the sale leaseback of our restaurant support headquarters in lenexa  kansas  resulting in cash proceeds of million 
we have agreements to franchise an additional seven company operated restaurants in the first fiscal quarter of  the franchising of five of these was completed on february  we are actively engaged with several interested buyers for each of applebee s remaining company operated restaurants  except for a number of locations we intend to keep as research and development locations in the kansas city market 
we are aiming to franchise approximately restaurants in with the reminder being franchised in these two initiatives and the strategic emphasis on franchising going forward are designed to reduce the operating and overhead costs attributable to the domestic company operated restaurants and reduce the capital requirements needed to operate the business 
energize the applebee s brand we have made progress in revitalizing the applebee s brand in in the following areas we introduced a new applebee s advertising campaign it s a whole new neighborhood 
our message in the ads clearly focuses on classic grill bar food in a way that is unique to applebee s  we developed our brand positioning  refined our customer targets  and introduced our new menu strategy  we developed new classic grill and bar menu offerings scheduled for introduction in early  and we introduced a new value offering in the fourth quarter to help drive guest traffic 
based on favorable consumer response to this value proposition we will continue to focus on value in improve restaurant operations and profitabilty initiatives to improve operations and profitability at applebee s restaurants system wide were introduced in we implemented initiatives in our company operated restaurants to increase restaurant profitability including improved labor scheduling and labor rate controls  food cost improvement initiatives  and stricter management of complimentary meals and discounts  we improved overall guest satisfaction with faster meal delivery times  better food quality and server attentiveness 
we will continue to drive improved results and strive to ensure that every guest leaves happy  and we implemented a franchisee operations rating system to provide visibility to our franchisees concerning their performance in relation to guest experience  food safety and training 
in a challenging economic environment and a highly competitive casual dining category  there can be no assurance that the strategies described above  when implemented  will achieve the intended results  including the franchising of the remaining domestic company operated restaurants  within the time frame described above 
ihop s key strategies we pursue growth through a three part strategic framework energize the ihop brand  improve operations performance  and maximize franchise development 
energize the ihop brand we seek to energize our brand by continuing our come hungry 
leave happy advertising campaign 
this message has successfully resonated with our guests for almost six years and we expect to continue with this campaign in the future 
in addition  we seek to enhance our media strategies to emphasize national advertising on broadcast  cable and syndicated television and strengthen our product promotion process 
over the last two years  we have shifted the allocation of our media spending towards national advertising 
five of the six media windows utilized by us in placed significant emphasis on national media spending 
we had not utilized any national media prior to in  we also initiated the strategy of limited time offers on promotional products 
since that time  we have enhanced our execution of this promotional product approach by improving the appeal of these promotions and the franchisees execution 
in addition  by the end of  our franchisees will have completed the remodel of all restaurants to our current updated look 
we developed new prototype and remodel programs in  which have become the standards for all development and remodel activity going forward 
we also launched our ihop n go takeout program in february and a successful gift card program in in order to ensure that we remain relevant with our customers and meet their changing dining patterns 
improve operations performance we will seek to continue to improve the operations of the restaurants 
during  we established an ihop franchisee ratings system to evaluate the operational standards of each of our restaurant units 
this franchisee rating system is a comprehensive scorecard in which we assign grades that covers mystery shop scores  operational assessment scores and health department ratings  among other things 
by december   of all franchisees had received grades of a or b for their restaurants 
in addition  we intend to continue focusing on making exceptional service a priority for franchisees by providing tools for improved restaurant execution  while highlighting our motto service as good as our pancakes 
substantially all ihop restaurants are using pollable point of sale pos systems to capture and report a broad range of sales and product mix data 
this information is used by management to  among other things  gauge guest acceptance of menu items and the success of promotions and limited time offers 
maximize franchise development under the current business model  ihop seeks to maximize franchise development by emphasizing the recruitment of franchise developers within and outside the current system in order to grow its revenues 
because of our strong existing franchisee base  since  more than of new restaurants have been opened by pre existing franchisees 
this strategy has proven very successful as franchisees have developed approximately units since the inception of the current business model and we have a pipeline of additional new units committed  optioned or pending 
in addition  we may take steps to intervene  consolidate  and rehabilitate one or two existing markets if we believe that doing so is advisable in order to fully realize development potential 
to effect this strategy  we would repurchase units from certain existing franchisees and package them in a sale to a franchise developer who would commit to maximize development in the market 
significant known events  trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results global economic contraction in  economic conditions in both the us and worldwide have experienced a downturn due to the compounded effects of the subprime lending crisis  the credit market liquidity crisis  and the collateral effects of each on the finance and banking industries 
in addition  volatile energy costs  concerns about inflation and deflation  slower economic activity  softness in both the commercial and residential real estate markets  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending and rising unemployment have combined to create generally adverse business conditions for all industries and sectors 
these conditions make it extremely difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities as the reduction in disposable income for discretionary spending could cause our customers to change historic purchasing behavior and choose lower cost dining options or alternatives to dining out 
these economic developments may affect our business and operations in a number of ways  including but not limited to lower profitability and cash flows from company operated restaurants  reduced payments from franchisees due to both a lower sales base on which royalties and other payments are calculated and possible impairment to the ability of franchisees to make payments when due as the result of the economic effects cited above on their businesses  limited availability of financing for franchisees to fulfill their new restaurant development commitments  limited credit availability for potential purchasers of applebee s company operated restaurants  lower proceeds from refranchising transactions due to both lower sales and profitability or inability to consummate transactions at all  and lower estimated fair values for goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets resulting in future non cash impairment charges 
we cannot predict the effect or duration of this economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent recovery in the economy in general or the restaurant industry in particular 
if our business significantly deteriorates due to these macroeconomic effects  our financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
securitized debt and related interest expense we incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness to finance the applebee s acquisition 
as a result  our interest expense has increased significantly from that reported in prior years and is expected to remain as one of the largest components of costs and expenses in the future until such time that debt balances are repaid or otherwise retired 
significant gains and charges there were several significant gains and charges affecting the comparisons with previously reported results 
in  we recognized impairment and closure charges of million and a gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
in  we recognized a loss on a derivative financial instrument of million  impairment and closure charges of million and a loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
each transaction is discussed in further detail under paragraphs captioned with those descriptions elsewhere in item given the uncertainty as to the length of the current economic contraction and the timing and degree of recovery  it is reasonably possible that impairment charges may occur in future periods 
the fair value of our debt is currently less than its carrying value see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and is likely to remain less than carrying value for the foreseeable future such that it is reasonably possible that extinguishments of debt will result in gains in future periods 
financial statement effect of franchising company operated restaurants we franchised applebee s company operated restaurants during and are planning to franchise a significant majority of the remaining company operated applebee s by the end of as the number of company operated restaurants declines  the amount of company restaurant revenues and company restaurant expenses in future periods will decline significantly compared to amounts reported in previous periods 
franchise royalty revenues and expenses will likely increase as company operated restaurants are franchised  although not in the same magnitude as the company restaurant revenues decline as franchise royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisee s revenues 
segment reporting our revenues and expenses are recorded in four segments franchise operations  company restaurant operations  rental operations  and financing operations 
within the applicable segment  we operate two distinct restaurant concepts applebee s and ihop 
applebee s the franchise operations segment consists of restaurants operated by applebee s franchisees in the united states  one us territory and countries outside of the united states

captive insurance subsidiary in connection with the acquisition of applebee s  the company acquired neighborhood insurance  inc  a vermont corporation and a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary of applebee s  which provides applebee s and qualified applebee s franchisees with workers compensation and general liability insurance 
the captive insurance subsidiary ceased writing insurance prior to the acquisition

ihop effective franchise restaurants increased to  units  an increase of due to net new restaurant openings in and the annualized effect of new restaurant development in in  ihop introduced several new promotions shortcake pancakes  tour de french toast  and coffee cake pancakes  as well as a week discover america pancakes campaign that was part of a celebration of ihop s th anniversary 
ihop also promoted the brand with menu tie ins to the film horton hears a who 
ihop continued its string of consecutive quarters of same store sales growth through the third fiscal quarter of  but guest traffic declined in the fourth fiscal quarter of due to a combination of several severe hurricanes and the mounting economic crisis that began to erode customer confidence 
consolidated franchise expenses increased by million in as compared to  which was due to the increase in franchise expenses for ihop restaurants of million and the inclusion of twelve months of applebee s franchise expenses in as opposed to one month in ihop franchise expenses such as advertising and the cost of proprietary products are related to ihop franchise restaurant retail sales 
the increase in ihop franchise expenses was primarily a result of the increase in ihop franchise restaurant retail sales  in addition to an increase in the amount of financial relief granted to ihop franchisees 
these increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense 
applebee s franchise expenses are relatively smaller than ihop s due to advertising expenses 
franchise fees designated for ihop s national advertising fund and local marketing and advertising cooperatives are recognized as revenue and expense of franchise operation  however  applebee s national advertising fund and local advertising cooperatives constitute agency transactions and therefore are not recognized as franchise revenue and expense

the company restaurant expenses increased by million as compared to this increase was due to applebee s  which contributed million of the increase see pro forma comparison of the fiscal years ended december   and applebee s 
ihop company restaurant operations  which are essentially research and development restaurants and restaurants reacquired from franchisees that are operated on a temporary basis  were relatively unchanged from the prior year 
ihop company restaurant sales and cost of sales were lower in as compared to due to two fewer effective restaurants  resulting in a slightly lower segment loss 
rental operations variance in thousands rental income rental expenses rental segment profit rental operations profit  which is rental income less rental expenses  decreased by million or in as compared to rental operations profit was impacted by the write off of deferred rent resulting from terminated subleases on restaurants reacquired in deferred rent on operating subleases is the difference between straight line rent and the actual amount received 
straight line rent is the amount of rent over the full lease term spread over equal monthly amounts

as the result of several transactions related to the franchising of applebee s company operated restaurants  applebee s now has rental income 
the amount of applebee s rental income in was  offset by  of expense 
the activity relates only to the franchising of the restaurants  applebee s is not entering into rental operations similar to those of ihop 
financing operations variance in thousands financing income financing expenses financing segment profit financing operations profit  which is financing revenues less financing expenses  is exclusively attributable to the ihop business unit 
in  financing operations profit decreased by million compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in franchise and equipment note interest due to the expected reduction in franchise fee note balances 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in net profit margin on the sale of franchises and equipment associated with company developed and rehabilitated and refranchised restaurants 
in  the company had a net profit margin of million associated with refranchised restaurants  compared to a margin of million associated with four refranchised restaurants in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million or in compared to the prior year  primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of applebee s expenses in as opposed to one month in the full year of applebee s expenses represented million of the increase 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to litigation settlements of million  and increased professional and consulting services of million  primarily related to the ongoing integration of applebee s 
the company expects that general and administrative expenses will decrease in due to i the planned refranchising of approximately applebee s company operated restaurants and ii cost cutting measures implemented in february interest expense interest expense increased by million in compared to  primarily attributable to a full year of interest expense associated with the debt incurred for the acquisition as compared to one month in interest expense in comprised primarily interest on acquisition related debt of million  interest on applebee s financing obligations related to sales leaseback transactions of million  non cash amortization of deferred financing costs of million  and non cash amortization of the loss on the effective portion of an interest rate swap of million 
impairment and closure charges impairment and closure charges increased significantly to million in compared to million in  with closure charges representing million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in june  the company entered into a sale leaseback transaction relating to parcels of real estate comprising land  buildings and improvements 
the net book value of the real estate exceeded the proceeds received by million 
all of the parcels involved in the transactions had been acquired in the november  acquisition of applebee s and their estimated fair value was assigned as part of the purchase price allocation as of that date 
the company evaluated events subsequent to november  and noted a deterioration in both the domestic real estate and credit markets between the date of the purchase price allocation and the june closing date of the sale leaseback transactions 
in the absence of objective evidence to the contrary  the company concluded that the estimated fair value of the real estate determined in the purchase price allocation had been reasonable  and the decline in value related primarily to market events subsequent to the acquisition date necessitating an impairment charge as opposed to an adjustment to the allocated purchase price 
the company evaluated whether this charge  in addition to other macroeconomic data and the decline in the market price of the company s common stock  were indicators of potential impairment of its goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
the company concluded that they were not indicators  because i the impairment charge was related to a specific transaction that resulted in the disposal of the majority of the company s real estate  ii applebee s june  year to date same store sales for company operated stores had increased slightly compared with the same period of the prior year  iii while directionally the us economy was slowing down  there was considerable uncertainty as to the depth and duration of the slowdown  such that the company believed its internal forecasts of same store sales growth were achievable  and iv the company s net book value was in excess of its market capitalization throughout the period up to and including the date of filing its form q for the quarterly period ending june  as part of the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of its long lived assets  the company recorded impairment charges of million for the three month period ended september  of that amount  million related to applebee s properties and primarily resulted from a continuing deterioration in credit markets in general and a decline in operating results of applebee s company operated restaurants expected to be franchised in particular geographic areas 
the remainder of the impairment related to an individual underperforming ihop property whose estimates of future cash flows indicated that the carrying value would not be recovered 
the company again evaluated whether the impairment charges taken in the third quarter of  in addition to other macroeconomic data and the decline in the market price of the company s common stock  were an indicator of potential impairment of its goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
the company concluded that they were not an indicator  because i the impairments were related to specific transactions in three geographic markets characterized as having a larger proportion of underperforming restaurants than the other geographic markets in which the remaining company operated restaurants are located  ii while applebee s year to date september  same store sales for company operated stores had decreased slightly compared with the same period of the prior year  the company was in the process of implementing several initiatives designed to improve the same store sales and did not believe there had been enough time to adequately assess the effectiveness of those initiatives  iii while economic data confirmed that the us economy had been recessionary since december of  there was still considerable uncertainty as to the depth and duration of the slowdown  and although applebee s year to date same store sales were lower than the prior period  applebee s decline had been less than its competitors  such that the company believed its internal forecasts of same store sales growth were achievable  and iv the company s net book value was in excess of its market capitalization throughout the third quarter ended september   and while the market capitalization did decline below the company s net book value subsequent to september   by the october  date of filing its form q for the quarterly period ending september   the company s net book value was in excess of its market capitalization 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual test for impairment of goodwill 
we utilized a discounted cash flows model of the income approach to assess the fair value of our three reporting units  the ihop franchised restaurants unit ihop unit  applebee s company operated restaurants unit applebee s company unit and applebee s franchised restaurants unit applebee s franchise unit 
the impairment test of goodwill of the two applebee s units which hold the significant majority of the total goodwill was performed as of october  the impairment test of the goodwill of the ihop unit was performed as of december   the date as of which the analysis has been performed in prior years 
the first step of the impairment test compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to their carrying value 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the discounted cash flows model include future trends in sales  operating expenses  overhead expenses  depreciation  capital expenditures and changes in working capital along with an appropriate discount rate 
additional assumptions were made as to proceeds to be received from future franchising of company operated restaurants 
based on this first step  we concluded that the fair value of the ihop unit and the applebee s franchise unit was in excess of their respective net carrying values and no impairment of goodwill was warranted 
however  the fair value of the applebee s company unit was less than the net carrying value of its assets assigned  requiring the second step of the impairment test 
in performing the second step of the impairment test we concluded that the goodwill allocated to the applebee s company unit was fully impaired and an impairment charge of million was recorded 
no tax benefit is associated with the impairment of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of the commercial real estate market continued to weaken  the credit markets continued constrained  economic forecasts were uncertain as to how long the recessionary period would last  and the company s stock price declined 
the company revised the significant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows model and updated its impairment analysis of the applebee s franchise unit 
the company determined the fair value of the applebee s franchise unit was in excess of its carrying value as of december  in addition  the company performed an impairment test of its indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily the applebee s tradename assigned in the purchase price allocation 
we utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the fair value of the tradename 
we determined the fair value of the tradename as of december  was less than the carrying value 
an impairment charge of million was recorded with a tax benefit of million associated with the charge 
impairment and closure charges in included the impairment of long lived assets for three restaurants closed in  and impairment losses on two restaurants in which the reacquisition values exceeded the historical resale values 
the decision to close or impair the restaurants in was a result of a comprehensive analysis that examined restaurants not meeting minimum return on investment thresholds and certain other operating performance criteria 
the assets for these restaurants were written down to their estimated fair value 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due to the inclusion of twelve months of amortization in as compared to one month in the amortization relates to intangible assets with finite lives  primarily franchising rights  recorded as part the allocation of the applebee s purchase price 
gain loss on extinguishment of debt in august  the company retired certain series class a ii a fixed rate term senior notes due december with a face amount of million for a cash payment of million 
the transaction resulted in a gain of million after the write off of the discount and deferred financing costs related to the debt retired 
in october  the company retired certain series class a ii x fixed rate term senior notes due december with a face amount of million for a cash payment of million 
the company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately million after the write off of the discount and deferred financing costs related to the debt retired 
the loss on extinguishment of debt of million in resulted from early debt retirement with funds generated by the securitization transactions for ihop 
these costs include the write off of deferred financing costs in the amount of million  and million for prepayment penalties as a result of paying off ihop s pre existing debt 
loss on derivative financial instrument as further described under liquidity and capital resources  we entered into a swap arrangement in july we terminated the swap arrangement upon the consummation of the applebee s acquisition on november  settlement of the swap resulted in a loss related to the decline in fair value of the undesignated portion of the hedge of million for no such transaction occurred in provision for income taxes we recognized a tax benefit of million in as compared to a tax benefit of million in the change was primarily due to the decrease in our pretax book income  partially offset by impairment of non deductible goodwill 
comparison of the fiscal years ended december  and overview our financial results were significantly impacted by one month of applebee s operations since the date of acquisition  a loss on derivative financial instrument and increased interest expense on billion worth of funded debt 
in comparing the company s financial results for to those in  we note that net loss of million in was comprised of ihop net income of million offset by applebee s net loss of million  ihop net income decreased in to million from million in primarily due to the loss on derivative financial instrument of million million net of tax in  franchise operations profit for ihop restaurants in increased by million or due to higher revenues associated with franchise restaurant retail sales  general and administrative expenses for ihop increased by million or primarily due to costs related to the applebee s acquisition  and diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by in franchise operations variance revenues applebee s ihop total franchise revenue consolidated franchise revenues grew by million or in as compared to consolidated franchise revenues grew due to the applebee s acquisition which increased franchise revenues by million or  as well as a increase in ihop franchise restaurant retail sales in as compared to the increase in ihop franchise restaurant retail sales was primarily attributable to the following effective ihop franchise restaurants increased by  and same store sales for ihop franchise restaurants increased by 
effective restaurants are the number of restaurants in a given fiscal period adjusted to account for restaurants open for only a portion of the period 
ihop effective franchise restaurants increased by or due to new restaurant openings in and the annualized effect of new restaurant development in in  ihop had various promotions including the rollout of new menu items in november  and other promotions throughout the year which included pancake surrender  fruit crepe fever  sweet strawberry serenade  stuffed french toast treasures  and cinn a stacks celebration 
ihop also increased national advertising spending to include an additional promotional period in november and december over local media spending in for that period 
consolidated franchise expenses increased by million or in as compared to  which was primarily due to the increase in franchise expenses for ihop restaurants in the amount of million or 
ihop franchise expenses such as advertising and the cost of proprietary products are related to ihop franchise restaurant retail sales 
the increase in ihop franchise expenses was primarily a result of the increase in ihop franchise restaurant retail sales 
partially offsetting this increase  ihop franchise expenses benefited from lower incentives to ihop franchisees for point of sale system purchases  as well as a reduction in the amount of financial relief granted to ihop franchisees 
the reduction in franchisee relief granted was primarily due to fewer underperforming restaurants in our system than in previous periods 
company restaurant operations increase revenues applebee s ihop total company restaurant sales total company restaurant sales in increased by million as compared to the increase in total company restaurant sales was due almost exclusively to the applebee s acquisition which contributed million of the increase 
the company restaurant expenses increased by million  or  as compared to this increase was due almost exclusively to applebee s  which contributed million  or  of the increase 
company restaurant operations loss  which is income less expenses  for ihop company restaurants was million in  or higher than the loss of million in this is primarily due to lower sales per restaurant as well as higher salary and benefits costs 
rental operations rental operations profit  which is rental income less rental expenses and exclusively ihop  decreased by million or in  as compared to rental operations profit in compared to was impacted by the write off of deferred rent resulting from terminated subleases on restaurants reacquired in deferred rent on operating subleases is the difference between straight line rent and the actual amount received 
straight line rent is the amount of rent over the full lease term spread over equal monthly amounts 
financing operations financing operations profit  which is financing revenues less financing expenses  is exclusively attributable to the ihop business unit 
in financing operations profit decreased by million or compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in franchise and equipment note interest due to the expected reduction in franchise fee note balances 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in net profit margin on the sale of franchises and equipment associated with company developed and rehabilitated and refranchised restaurants 
in  the company had a net profit margin of million associated with four refranchised restaurants  compared to a negative margin of million associated with nine refranchised restaurants in loss on derivative financial instrument as further described under liquidity and capital resources  we entered into a swap arrangement in july settlement of the swap resulted in additional interest expense related to the designated portion of million for and million of interest expense related to the amortization of other comprehensive loss related to the designated portion of the swap over the expected life of the related debt  which is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million or in compared to the prior year  primarily due to one month of applebee s expenses in the amount of million 
general and administrative expenses for ihop as a percentage of total ihop operating revenues increased in compared to in  primarily due to increased professional services  and increased expenses for equity based compensation 
professional services increased by million in compared to  primarily due to consulting fees related to the integration of applebee s 
excluding the acquisition related expenditures of million  growth would have been 
equity based compensation expenses related to the issuance of additional restricted stock increased by million in compared to in addition  other compensation increased by million compared to interest expense interest expense increased by million in compared to  primarily due to one month of applebee s expenses in the amount of million which is attributable to interest associated with the securitization for the acquisition 
interest expense for ihop increased by million or in compared to as a result of the higher level of debt associated with the securitizations 
impairment and closure charges impairment and closure charges increased to million in from  in impairment and closure charges in included the impairment of long lived assets for three restaurants closed in  and two currently operated restaurants in cincinnati 
impairment charges in were primarily for the impairment of long lived assets on three restaurants 
the decision to close or impair the restaurants in and was a result of a comprehensive analysis that examined restaurants not meeting minimum return on investment thresholds and certain other operating performance criteria and represented a change in strategy from prior practices 
the assets for these restaurants were written down to their estimated fair value 
loss on extinguishment of debt the loss on extinguishment of debt of million in resulted from early debt retirement with funds generated by the securitization transactions for ihop 
these costs include the write off of deferred financing costs in the amount of million  and million for prepayment penalties as a result of paying off ihop s pre existing debt 
provision for income taxes we recognized a tax benefit of million in as compared to a tax provision of million in the change was primarily due to the release of certain unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations  higher compensation related income tax credits  and claims for the refund of income taxes paid in previous years partially offset by changes in state tax rates and state tax laws 
these adjustments have a significant impact on the effective tax rate in because of the decrease in our pretax book income 
pro forma comparison of the fiscal years ended december   and applebee s the following section illustrates certain financial results of applebee s on a stand alone basis comparing as consolidated into the company with information comprised of the month data from applebee s prior to the acquisition date of november  and the one month data of applebee s subsequent to the acquisition date pro forma

domestic franchise sales for applebee s restaurants in the period subsequent to the acquisition date were million 
franchise restaurant retail sales are sales recorded at restaurants that are owned by franchisees and are not attributable to the company 
franchise restaurant retail sales are useful in analyzing our franchise revenues because franchisees pay us royalties and other fees that are generally based on a percentage of their sales 
sales of restaurants that are owned by franchisees are not attributable to the company 
c sales percentage change reflects  for each category of restaurants  the percentage change in sales in any given fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year for all restaurants in that category 
the sales percentage change for applebee s restaurants was impacted by a rd week in in addition  all periods for company owned applebee s restaurants exclude the impact of discontinued operations 
d same store sales percentage change reflects the percentage change in sales  in any given fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year  for restaurants that have been operated throughout both fiscal periods that are being compared and have been open for at least months

company restaurant operations applebee s company restaurant sales for the full fiscal year in decreased from pro forma  million in to  million in this decrease was due primarily to the decrease in effective restaurants of from restaurants in to restaurants in due to the franchising of company stores during and a decrease in company same store sales of in as compared to the decrease in same store sales is driven mainly by decline in guest traffic partially offset by an increase in average guest check 
the company believes that the decrease experienced in comparable guest traffic is reflective of the current economic conditions impacting consumers 
the increase in average guest check is due to menu price increases and a favorable mix shift

total food and beverage costs as a percent of company restaurant sales were flat in as compared to food usage was impacted by increased commodity costs but offset by price increases and food cost improvement initiatives 
total labor costs as a percent of company restaurant sales decreased by in as compared to the decrease in was due primarily to reductions in hourly labor costs as a percentage of sales due to an increased guest check offset by higher management incentive compensation driven by a more costly bonus program in place during the first fiscal quarter of direct and occupancy costs decreased by in as compared to due primarily to favorable depreciation expense  which resulted from purchase price allocations related to applebee s acquisition and the reclassification of restaurants into assets held for sale  partially offset by an increase in rent expense and smallwares associated with purchase accounting and unfavorable utility expense 
pre opening expense decreased by in as compared to due to opening one company restaurant in early as compared to in we do not currently plan to open any domestic company operated restaurants in the foreseeable future

direct and occupancy costs increased by in as compared to due primarily to lower sales volumes at company restaurants which resulted in unfavorable year over year comparisons for depreciation and rent  as a percentage of sales  due to their relatively fixed nature as well as higher repairs and maintenance and credit card usage expense 
this increase was partially offset by lower kitchen and dining supplies expense 
pre opening expense decreased by in as compared to due to the number of company restaurant openings 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from in to in the increase was due primarily to additional stock based compensation recognized and severance costs accrued for employees who are expected to be terminated in connection with the applebee s acquisition as well as the costs related to the exploration of strategic alternatives for enhancing shareholder value 
liquidity and capital resources of the company prior to the acquisition of applebee s  our primary ongoing sources of liquidity were cash provided by operating activities and principal receipts from notes and equipment contracts receivable from our franchisees  while our principal uses of cash were common stock repurchases  payments of dividends and capital investment 
the acquisition of applebee s had a significant impact on the liquidity and capital resources of the company 
we incurred approximately billion of indebtedness 
while the addition of applebee s increased our cash flow from operations  a significant portion of the increase was consumed by interest payments on that indebtedness 
cash paid for interest increased to million in as compared to million in and million in the amount of indebtedness also limits our ability to obtain additional financing  due to both explicit limitations in the indenture under which the indebtedness was issued and marketplace perception of our remaining debt capacity 
as described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  the fixed rate notes issued as part of the applebee s securitization transaction have a legal maturity of december  however  the indenture under which the notes were issued includes provisions which may accelerate certain of the payment dates which  if not met  would require the company to use operating funds to begin to pay down the outstanding debt 
the accelerated payment dates for the applebee s securitization are as follows class a ii a fixed rate term senior notes december class a ii x fixed rate term senior notes december class m fixed rate term subordinated notes december as of december   there was no acceleration of payment dates 
another impact of the applebee s acquisition on our liquidity is the planned monetization of certain applebee s assets 
we are continuing to pursue a strategy which contemplates transitioning from our current franchised applebee s system to an approximately franchised applebee s system  similar to ihop s franchised system 
in order to accomplish this strategy  we plan to franchise substantially all of the company operated applebee s restaurants while retaining one company market in kansas city 
this heavily franchised business model is expected to require less capital investment  improve margins and reduce the volatility of cash flow performance over time  while also providing cash proceeds from the franchising of the restaurants 
if our strategy to transition to a franchised system is delayed or sales proceeds from franchising restaurants are less than anticipated  we believe that the company operated applebee s restaurants will continue to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our obligations  such that we will not be compelled to enter into refranchising transactions at prices lower than we deem appropriate 
under the terms of the securitized debt agreements  all of the proceeds of asset dispositions must be used to retire long term debt 
during  we completed the following asset dispositions a sale leaseback transaction for the real property on which of the fee owned  company operated applebee s restaurants are situated  the sale of one additional fee owned real estate parcel and a sale leaseback transaction with respect to applebee s corporate headquarters in lenexa  kansas 
we received approximately million in proceeds from these transactions 
during  we also completed the franchising of company operated applebee s restaurants in the california  nevada  delaware and texas markets 
we received after tax proceeds of approximately million from these transactions 
the proceeds from these transactions were used primarily to repay million of series class a i x fixed rate term senior notes to repay portions of other long term debt  to pay transaction expenses payment of which had been deferred related to the acquisition of applebee s and for general corporate purposes 
on february  we completed the franchising of five restaurants in the new mexico market and expect to recognize a gain of approximately million on this transaction 
applebee s has a million revolving credit facility  the series class a variable funding senior notes  committed to by lehman brothers holdings inc lbhi the lehman facility 
lbhi filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on september  this bankruptcy filing created uncertainty as to our ability to continue to access funds under the lehman facility 
as a result  in september  the company borrowed an additional million under the lehman facility  bringing our total borrowings to the maximum of million  which amount was outstanding at september  the million has been used to purchase money market funds that are invested in us government securities 
the money market funds are considered cash equivalents 
ihop has a million revolving credit facility  the series variable funding note  committed to by calyon americas the calyon facility 
at december   borrowings under the calyon facility were million 
we do not believe there would be significant impediments to accessing any of the remaining million of credit available under the calyon facility 
debt covenant compliance as part of the financing for the applebee s acquisition  certain subsidiaries of the company completed two separate securitization transactions 
the securitization transactions consisted of an issuance of debt collateralized by applebee s restaurant assets the applebee s notes and a separate issuance of debt collateralized by ihop restaurant assets the ihop notes 
in addition  ihop completed a million securitization in march  which is subject to the same debt covenants as ihop s november securitization 
this securitized debt is subject to a series of covenants and restrictions which are customary for transactions of this type 
as of december   approximately billion of securitized debt is subject to these covenants and restrictions 
the two most significant covenants require the maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio and certain debt service coverage ratios 
the consolidated leverage ratio is defined as the sum of i all securitized debt assuming all variable funding facilities are fully drawn  ii all other debt of the company  and iii the product of the current monthly operating lease expense and  that sum divided by the sum of i the company s ebitda as defined for the preceding months and ii annualized operating lease expense 
maximum ratios for this test are as follows applebee s notes ihop notes through november x x through november x x thereafter x x failure to remain under these maximums could result in required early amortization of outstanding principal amounts of the applebee s notes or ihop notes 
at december   the company s consolidated leverage ratio was x 
the debt service coverage ratio dscr is a fairly complex formula with numerous defined terms 
in concept  it is the ratio of net cash flow as defined for the preceding three months divided by total debt service payments  which include  among other things  interest payments  insurance premiums and administrative expenses 
the minimum dscr is x 
the consequences of falling below the minimum dscr vary depending upon the actual ratio achieved 
a ratio less than x can trigger a cash trapping event  a rapid amortization event  or default 
in a cash trapping event a trustee is required to retain a certain percentage of cash flow after all required payments  as defined  have been made in a restricted account 
no principal amounts of debt are retired in a cash trapping event 
in a rapid amortization event all excess cash flow after all required payments  as defined  have been made is retained and used to retire principal amounts of debt 
these events are triggered as follows applebee s notes ihop notes cash trapping event less than x of cash flow less than x of cash flow cash trapping event less than x of cash flow less than x of cash flow rapid amortization event less than x less than x default event less than x less than x there are also provisions for a one time cure of either a cash trapping event or a rapid amortization event if the dscr recovers to certain levels 
a rapid amortization event can also be triggered in other defined circumstances unrelated to the dscr  including applebee s failure to maintain a minimum level of system wide sales 
at december   the applebee s dscr was x and the ihop dscr was x 
our ability to pay the interest on our indebtedness  to make scheduled payments of principal and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon the current level of operations and our current expectations for future periods in light of the current economic environment  we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents  together with expected cash flows from operations  sale leaseback and refranchising will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  retirement of securitized debt  capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next months 
further  we currently believe that we will remain in compliance with the debt covenants discussed above for at least the next months 
we believe that we will have the necessary liquidity through our current cash balances  operating cash flow  the ihop revolving credit facility and proceeds from additional franchising of applebee s company operated restaurants for the next year to fund our debt service requirements  capital expenditures and other operational cash requirements 
however  if we are not able to achieve forecasted revenue targets and operating improvements or effect franchisings of applebee s restaurants at prices currently anticipated  this assessment will have to be reconsidered 
additionally  certain applebee s notes have accelerated payment dates of december  and we will likely seek to refinance this debt if it has not been repaid prior to then 
we may not be able to effect any future refinancing of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
cash flows in summary  our cash flows were as follows in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by revenues earned and collected from our franchisees  operating earnings from our company operated restaurants and rental operations profit from our leases 
franchise revenues consist of royalties  ihop advertising fees  and sales of proprietary products for ihop which fluctuate with increases or decreases in franchise retail sales 
franchise retail sales are impacted by the development of ihop and applebee s restaurants by our franchisees and by fluctuations in same store sales 
company operated operating earnings are impacted by many factors which include  but are not limited  to changes in traffic pattern  pricing activities and changes in operating expenses 
rental operations profit is rental income less rental expenses 
rental income includes revenue from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases 
rental expenses are costs of prime operating leases and interest expense on prime capital leases on franchisee operated restaurants 
cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from million in the increase was due primarily to the inclusion of applebee s operating activities for a full year in as opposed to one month in  substantially offset by the increased interest on securitized debt 
cash paid for interest in was million as compared to million in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily attributable to in proceeds from dispositions of assets  principally the franchising of applebee s company operated restaurants and million in principal receipts from notes and equipment contracts receivable 
these inflows were partially offset by million in capital expenditures  of which million related to applebee s  consisting of million related to company operated restaurants and million related to corporate activities  primarily applebee s restaurant support center in lenexa  kansas 
capital expenditures are expected to decline in as we do not currently plan to develop any company operated applebee s restaurants and the support center was completed in the following table represents the principal receipts on various receivables due from our franchisees as of december  principal receipts due by period thereafter total in thousands equipment leases direct financing leases franchise notes and other total equipment lease receivables extend through the year direct financing lease receivables extend through the year franchise note receivables extend through the year financing activities net cash used by financing activities in was primarily attributable to the repayment of long term debt  capital lease and financing obligations totaling million  the payment of million of debt issuance costs and million in dividend payments  which were comprised of million of dividends on common stock and million of dividends on series a preferred stock 
these outflows were partially offset by proceeds from financing obligations of million  the million borrowing against the lehman facility discussed above  and the release of million of restricted cash 
effective december   the company has suspended payments of dividends to common shareholders for the foreseeable future 
net cash used in financing activities in and was primarily attributable to stock repurchases  dividend payments  repayment of long term debt and principal payments on capital lease obligations  partially offset by stock option exercises 
share repurchases and dividends in january  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of the company s common stock 
as of december   the board approved the repurchase of up to million shares of common stock 
during  the company repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock for million 
the company has repurchased million shares of its common stock since the inception of the program at a total cost of million 
the company did not repurchase shares in 
in february  the board of directors cancelled the authorization to repurchase any additional shares under this program 
we had accrued million as dividends for the series a perpetual preferred stock as of december  the dividends were paid in january the company has paid regular quarterly dividends of per common share since may a quarterly cash dividend of per common share was paid on november   which was the fourth dividend payment of in december  the board of directors suspended the payment of the quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders for the foreseeable future as part of actions the company is taking to maximize its financial flexibility 
future dividend declarations on the common shares may be made at the discretion of the board of directors after consideration of the company s earnings  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects and other factors 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a of sec regulation s k 
contractual obligations and commitments the following are our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations year years years more than years total in thousands debt financing obligation operating leases capital leases purchase commitments other obligations total minimum payments less interest as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
at december   we had a reserve for unrecognized tax benefit including potential interest and penalties  net of related tax benefit  totaling million  of which approximately million is expected to be paid within one year 
for the remaining liability  due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements purchase price allocation the purchase price for acquisitions is allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
the determination of estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets requires significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the estimated future cash flows  estimated useful lives of assets and appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the applebee s assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  the fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation may change during the allowable allocation period under sfas  which is up to one year from the acquisition date  if additional information becomes available that would require changes to our estimates 
long lived assets we assess long lived and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
we consider factors such as the number of years the restaurant has been operated by us  sales trends  cash flow trends  remaining lease life  and other factors which apply on a case by case basis 
the analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level for indicators of permanent impairment 
recoverability of the restaurant s assets is measured by comparing the assets carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated over the assets remaining useful life or remaining lease term  whichever is less 
if the total expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  the carrying amount is written down to the estimated fair value  and a loss resulting from impairment is recognized by charging to earnings 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
goodwill and intangibles goodwill is recorded when the aggregate purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisition are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and are estimated by management based on the fair value of the assets received 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised primarily of trademarks  trade names and franchise agreements 
identifiable assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight line method and estimated useful lives 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not subject to amortization 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill has been allocated to three reporting units  the ihop franchised restaurants unit ihop unit  applebee s company operated restaurants unit applebee s company unit and applebee s franchised restaurants unit applebee s franchise unit 
the significant majority of the company s goodwill resulted from the november  acquisition of applebee s and has been allocated between the two applebee s units 
the company tests goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter 
the impairment test of goodwill of the two applebee s units was performed as of october  the impairment test of the goodwill of the ihop unit was performed as of december   the date as of which the analysis has been performed in prior years 
in addition to the annual test of impairment  goodwill must be evaluated more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments  or a significant decline in the market price of the company s common stock 
in the process of the company s annual impairment review  the company primarily uses the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the discounted cash flows model include future trends in sales  operating expenses  overhead expenses  depreciation  capital expenditures  and changes in working capital along with an appropriate discount rate 
additional assumptions are made as to proceeds to be received from future franchising of company operated restaurants 
step one of the impairment test compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value 
if the fair value is in excess of the carrying value  no impairment exists 
if the step one test does indicate an impairment  step two must take place 
under step two  the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated as if the reporting unit were acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the carrying amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill  to which the carrying value of the goodwill must be adjusted 
the fair value of all reporting units is then compared to the current market value of the company s common stock to determine if the fair values estimated in the impairment testing process are reasonable in light of the current market value 
leases our restaurants are located on i sites owned by us  ii sites leased by us from third parties and iii sites owned or leased by franchisees 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases sfas and subsequent amendments 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
prior to january   we capitalized rent expense from possession date through construction completion and reported the related asset in property and equipment 
capitalized rent was amortized through depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the related assets limited to the lease term 
straight line rent recorded during the preopening period construction completion through restaurant open date was recorded as expense 
commencing january   we expense rent from possession date through restaurant open date  in accordance with fasb staff position no 
 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
once a restaurant opens for business  we record straight line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
we use a consistent lease term when calculating depreciation of leasehold improvements  when determining straight line rent expense and when determining classification of our leases as either operating or capital 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the restaurant open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lesser occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
certain of our lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances 
for purposes of recognizing incentives  we amortize the incentives over the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term 
for tenant improvement allowances  we also record a deferred rent liability or an obligation in our non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payment that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
insurance reserves we use estimates in the determination of the appropriate liabilities for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance 
the estimated liability is established based upon historical claims data and third party actuarial estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
unanticipated changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates 
we periodically reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
a change in any of the above estimates could impact our consolidated statements of earnings  and the related asset or liability recorded in our consolidated balance sheets would be adjusted accordingly 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
accordingly  we measure stock based compensation expense at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize the expense over the employee s requisite service period using the straight line method 
under sfas r  the fair value of each employee stock option and restricted stock award is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based compensation 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of sfas r 
the measurement of stock based compensation expense is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors  such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate 
these inputs are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if differences arise between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future stock based compensation expense 
any such changes could materially impact our operations in the period in which the changes are made and in subsequent periods 
derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business we utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
we account for our derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the standard requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of the hedging relationships 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates 
all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge ie  hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings for example  in interest expense when the hedged transactions are interest cash flows associated with debt 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item  if any  is recognized in other income expense in current earnings during the period of change 
at inception of the hedge  we choose the hypothetical derivative method of effectiveness calculation  which we must use for the life of the contract and we will measure effectiveness quarterly 
when hedge treatment is achieved under sfas  the changes in fair values related to the effective portion of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss or in income expense  depending on the designation of the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
we obtain the values on a quarterly basis from the counterparty of the derivative contracts 
the undesignated portion of the derivative contract is calculated and recorded in company s consolidated statements of operations at the end of each quarter until settled 
fair value measurements effective january   the company determines the fair market values of its financial assets and liabilities  as well as non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis  based on the fair value hierarchy established in sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

we measure our financial assets and liabilities using inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy 
the three levels are as follows level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability ie  interest rates  yield curves  etc  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means market corroborated inputs 
level includes unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
we develop these inputs based on the best information available  including our own data 
for more information on the financial instruments the company measures at fair value  see note  fair value measurements 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayers and respective governmental authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax accounting requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portions or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
tax contingency reserves result from our estimates of potential liabilities resulting from differences between actual and audited results 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretation of the tax laws 
changes in the tax contingency reserves result from resolution of audits of prior year filings  the expiration of the statute of limitations  changes in tax laws and current year estimates for asserted and unasserted items 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
significant changes in our estimates could materially affect our reported results 
under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is not longer met 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various tax jurisdictions 
the application is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal and apply the provisions of this statement for any acquisition after the adoption date 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of sfas r on our consolidated financial statements

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  the company will adopt the new disclosure requirements in the first quarter of fiscal as sfas does not change current accounting practice  there will be no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fsp emerging issues task force eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp 
fsp clarifies that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two class method described in sfas no

this fsp is effective on january  and requires all prior period earnings per share data that is presented to be adjusted retrospectively 
we do not expect fsp to have a material impact on our earnings per share calculations

fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the intent of fsp fas is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r and other applicable accounting literature 
fsp fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of fsp fas on its consolidated financial statements

fsp fas clarifies how sfas no 
should be applied when valuing securities in markets that are not active 
the company adopted sfas no 
 as amended  effective january  with the exception of the application of sfas no 
to non recurring non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting the remaining provisions of sfas on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which requires assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under sfas  a company may elect to use fair value to measure eligible items at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
eligible items include  but are not limited to  accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees  issued debt and firm commitments 
on january   the company adopted sfas and has not elected to use fair value measurement on any assets or liabilities under this statement 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no

in june  the eitf reached consensus on issue no 
 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards eitf

the impact of adopting eitf in did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk  including interest rates and commodity prices 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in the us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments  and interest expense on our variable funding notes 
our short and long term investments are comprised primarily of certificates of deposits and auction rate securities that are included in restricted assets related to the captive insurance subsidiary 
we have classified these investments as available for sale 
investments in fixed interest rate earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
due to the short time period between reset dates of the interest rates  there are no unrealized gains or losses associated with the auction rate securities 
as of december   we had investments in auction rate securities with contractual maturities ranging from to such investments have a weighted average yield of approximately 
based on our cash and cash equivalent and short term and long term investment holdings as of december   a decline in interest rates would decrease our annual interest income by approximately million 
on july   we entered into an interest rate swap contract the swap as a condition of the acquisition financing with lehman brothers special financial inc lbsfi  guaranteed by lehman brothers holdings  inc lbhi 
the swap was intended to hedge our interest payments on the asset backed notes that were issued in november to finance the applebee s acquisition 
the swap sets forth the terms of a five year interest rate swap in which we would be the fixed rate payer and lbsfi would be the floating rate payer the reference swap 
the reference swap has an effective date of july   a notional amount of billion  a floating rate of libor and a fixed rate of 
on november   we terminated the swap upon the consummation of the applebee s acquisition 
the fair value of the swap was million 
the fair value of the designated portion of the swap amounted to million million net of tax effect and is included as accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the undesignated portion of the swap resulted in additional interest expense of million for the year ended december   which was included in our consolidated statement of operations 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt 
if the interest on our variable rate debt were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt at december  commodity prices many of the food products purchased by us and our franchisees and area licensees are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to unpredictable price volatility 
to moderate the volatility  applebee s enters into fixed price purchase commitments 
ihop attempts to mitigate price fluctuations by entering into forward purchase agreements on all our major products 
none of these food product contracts or agreements is a derivative instrument 
extreme changes in commodity prices and or long term changes could affect our franchisees  area licensees and company operated restaurants adversely 
we expect that  in most cases  the ihop and applebee s systems would be able to pass increased commodity prices through to our consumers via increases in menu prices 
from time to time  competitive circumstances could limit short term menu price flexibility  and in those cases  margins would be negatively impacted by increased commodity prices 
we believe that any changes in commodity pricing that cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other strategies would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in some instances  we enter into commitments to purchase food and other items on behalf of the ihop and applebee s systems 
at december   our outstanding purchase commitments for food products were million 
the company has developed processes to facilitate the liquidation of these commitments to minimize financial exposure
