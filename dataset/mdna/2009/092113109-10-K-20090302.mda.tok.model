items management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and and a 
results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are an integrated energy company operating principally in the united states with two major business groups utilities and non regulated energy 
we report for our business groups in the following financial segments business group financial segment utilities electric utilities gas utilities non regulated energy oil and gas power generation coal mining energy marketing our utilities group consists of our electric and gas utility segments 
our electric utilities segment generates  transmits and distributes electricity to approximately  customers in south dakota  wyoming  colorado and montana and includes the operations of cheyenne light and its approximately  gas utility customers in wyoming 
our gas utilities segment serves approximately  natural gas customers in colorado  nebraska  iowa and kansas 
our non regulated energy group engages in the production of coal  natural gas and crude oil primarily in the rocky mountain region  the production of electric power through ownership of a portfolio of generating plants and the sale of electric power and capacity primarily under long term contracts  and the marketing of natural gas  crude oil and related services 
industry overview the united states energy industry experienced one of the most tumultuous years ever in energy commodity prices  which were near historic highs in july with natural gas trading over per mcf and crude oil selling for nearly per barrel  experienced dramatic declines to less than and  respectively  by year end 
domestic energy prices continue to be influenced by global factors  including foreign economic conditions  especially in china and asia  domestic economic conditions  the policies of opec and other large foreign oil producers  and political tensions and conflict in many regions 
mild weather dominated the united states during much of the year  reducing demand for fuel used for power generation and heating 
beginning in late summer  a slow down in the united states economy accelerated into one of the worst recessions since the s 
a global credit crisis emerged from a proliferation of sub prime lending 
as that issue attracted attention  other credit quality concerns surfaced  creating an international scale financial crisis 
the capital markets have been impacted dramatically by the crisis  severely inhibiting the ability of companies to raise both debt and equity capital  and significantly increasing the cost of capital 
like other united states industries  the energy industry is faced with uncertainties  both short and long term 
many utilities are faced with large capital spending needs over the next few years to replace aging infrastructure and add new assets such as transmission lines and renewable energy resources 
utility companies generally are less impacted by economic downturns  but a prolonged or severe recession could affect the demand for energy services and the ability of customers to pay their utility bills and restrict the ability of companies to obtain the capital necessary for infrastructure expansion 
the federal and state utility regulatory climate in  in a general sense  remained relatively constructive among government  industry and consumer representatives 
in the multi state region encompassing our utility operations  regulators were willing to establish rates based on multi year considerations  including fuel and other reasonable cost adjustments  justifiable capital expenditures for maintenance and expansion of energy systems  and a response to environmental concerns through demand management and energy efficiency programs 
the november elections however  represented a significant change in the domestic political environment 
sweeping wins for democrats in both houses of congress  signal a shift in domestic policy that will likely have dramatic impacts on the domestic energy industry 
despite all of the focus on the economy  environmental issues are slated to remain a priority for many in congress 
federal legislation that would mandate renewable energy use and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions appears likely to pass during this congress in the form of a federal renewable portfolio standard  and a greenhouse gas reduction target  utilizing either a carbon tax or a carbon cap and trade system 
these potential legislative actions could have significant macroeconomic consequences 
the associated cost increase may cause a dramatic increase in consumers rates for electricity and other energy in the mid to long term 
state legislatures were also active on environmental issues in  with a majority of states now having adopted some form of renewable standard  including some in which we operate 
in addition  several states have passed greenhouse gas emissions legislation 
progress in the domestic energy industry in included increasing levels of oil and gas exploration and production activity  continued planning and construction of liquefied natural gas port facilities  proposals for additional gas fired  coal fired and nuclear power plants  planning for additional electric transmission capacity  and the advancement of renewable energy resources and utilization 
the energy industry continues to adjust to change  including the trends of consolidation in the electric and gas utility sectors  along with asset divestitures to restrict or redefine business strategies 
the energy marketplace continues to respond to increased oversight and enforcement activity of the ferc and increased environmental and emissions reviews and mandates 
in recent years  several state regulatory agencies allowed electric utilities to construct and operate power plants in vertically integrated structures after years of discouraging or prohibiting such activity 
over the last several years  the corporate structure of many energy companies underwent evaluation and change  in large part due to efforts to create additional shareholder value 
a number of companies are contemplating or implementing a realignment of business lines  reflecting a shift in long term strategies 
some are divesting certain energy properties to focus on core businesses  such as exiting unregulated power production or oil and gas production in favor of more stable utility operations 
others have engaged in mergers and acquisitions with a goal to improve economies of scale and returns to investors 
private equity investors continued to play a role in the changing composition of energy ownership  but to a lesser extent than previous years 
many industry analysts have cited the need for expanded energy capacity and delivery systems 
they foresee an increase in capital investment across a wide spectrum of energy companies 
many electric and gas utilities must replace aging plant and equipment  and regulators appear to be willing to provide acceptable rate treatment for additional utility investment 
oil and gas producers will continue to explore for new reserves  particularly of natural gas  which will be the primary fuel of choice in an era of concern regarding greenhouse gas emissions 
in the short term  however  low oil and natural gas prices prompted companies to curtail projects as they seek to conserve cash in a constrained capital market environment 
the increased focus on environmental regulation has made it increasingly more difficult to obtain drilling permits  particularly on public and native american lands 
in early  the domestic coal industry benefited from a positive price environment  in large part due to high and volatile natural gas prices 
coal prices have moderated considerably in response to a trend of lower overall natural gas prices 
fossil fuel combustion continues to be a contentious domestic and international public policy issue  as many nations  including united states allies  advocate reductions in co and other emissions 
many states now encourage the energy industry to invest in renewable energy resources  such as wind or solar power  or the use of bio mass as a fuel 
in many instances  renewable energy use is mandated by state regulators 
furthermore  the state of california has mandated that future imports of power must come from power plants with lower emission levels than currently associated with conventional coal fired plants 
such restrictions may alter transmission flow of power in western states  as a large percentage of current power generation in the western grid comes from coal sources 
the power generation industry continues to make improvements in emissions control in response to regulatory mandates 
emissions from new coal fired plants are a small fraction of those produced by power plants built a generation ago 
along with similar technological progress  coal can and likely will remain an important  domestically available  and economical national energy resource that is vital to meet growing energy demand 
in that regard  the united states department of energy is beginning to take positive steps toward ensuring the future of coal through research funding for clean coal technologies and methods of carbon capture and sequestration 
energy providers  government authorities and private interests continue to address issues concerning electric transmission  power generation capacity  the use of renewable and other diversified sources of energy  oil and natural gas pipelines and storage  and other infrastructure requirements 
in the short term  prevailing economic conditions will reduce consumption 
despite public and private efforts to promote conservation and efficiency  however  the demand for energy is expected to increase steadily over the long term 
to meet this demand growth  the industry will need to provide capital  resources and innovation to serve customers in cost effective ways and to achieve suitable returns on investment 
the company believes that it is well positioned in this industry setting  and able to proceed with its key business objectives 
along with industry counterparts  we are preparing to address the challenges discussed in this overview  such as new environmental mandates  renewable portfolio standards  carbon related taxes or trading systems  credit market conditions  inflation  or other factors that may affect energy demand and supply 
in particular  we are sensitive to additional costs that can negatively affect our customers or our profitability 
to that end  we intend to work closely with regulators and industry leaders to assure that cost conscious proposals and solutions are carefully explored in public policy proceedings 
business strategy we are a customer focused integrated energy company 
our business is comprised of electric and natural gas utility operations  power generation  and fuel assets and services  including production and marketing operations for crude oil  natural gas and coal 
our focus on customers whether they are utility customers or non regulated generation  fuel or marketing customers provides opportunities to expand our businesses 
our balanced  integrated approach to the energy business is supported by disciplined risk management practices 
the diversity of our energy operations  which range from fuel production to retail utility sales  reduces reliance on any single business segment to achieve our strategic objectives 
it helps reduce our overall corporate risk and enhances our ability to earn stronger returns for shareholders over the long term 
despite very challenging conditions in the capital markets  we have sufficient liquidity and solid cash flows  and expect to be able to access the capital markets as needed 
consequently  our financial foundation is sound and capable of supporting an expansion of operations in both the near and long term 
during  we significantly transformed our business and reduced our risk profile through the acquisition of five utility properties  and the divestiture of seven ipp plants 
for the next two years  we will focus on continued integration of the newly acquired utility properties and the achievement of certain synergies made possible by the utility acquisition 
we expect to achieve operating synergies in accounting and information systems  procurement  inventory  utility engineering  power marketing  resource planning and other areas 
our long term strategy focuses on growing both our utility and non regulated energy businesses  primarily by increasing our customer base and providing superior service to both utility and non regulated energy customers 
in our natural gas and electric utilities  we intend to grow our asset base through customer growth in our existing utility service territories  combined with the construction of new rate based power generation facilities 
we also plan to pursue acquisitions of additional utility properties  primarily in the great plains and rocky mountain regions of the country 
by maintaining our high customer service and reliability standards in a cost efficient manner  our goal is to secure satisfactory rate recovery to provide solid economic returns on our utility investments 
in our fuel production operations  we will continue to prudently grow and develop our existing inventory of oil and gas reserves  while we strive to maintain our positive relationships with mineral owners  landowners and regulatory authorities 
our ability to grow both production and reserves may be hindered in the short term by low price levels for both crude oil and natural gas resulting from the impact on demand of a weakened economy 
in the long term  however  we believe that demand for natural gas will be strong 
given increased regulatory emphasis on wind and solar power generation  and potential greenhouse gas legislation that may limit construction of new coal fired power plants  natural gas will be the fuel of choice for power generation 
additional gas fired peaking resources will also be necessary to provide back up supply for renewable technologies 
we will continue efforts to develop additional markets for our coal production  including the development of additional power plants at our mine site 
nearly of all electricity generated in the united states is currently supplied from coal fired plants  and it will take decades before this generation can be replaced with alternative technologies 
as a result  coal fired resources will remain a necessary component of the nation s electric supply for the foreseeable future 
potential greenhouse gas legislation may limit construction of new conventional coal fired power plants  but technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration should provide for the long term economic use of coal 
we will investigate the possible deployment of these technologies at our mine site in wyoming 
we divested of seven ipp plants in because we were able to capture significant value for shareholders  but we are not exiting the non regulated power generation business 
we have expertise in permitting  constructing and operating power generation facilities  and these skills provide us with a key opportunity to add long term shareholder value 
we intend to grow our non regulated power generation business by continuing to focus on long term contractual relationships with other load serving utilities 
the expertise of our energy marketing business should provide continued profitability through a risk managed and disciplined approach to producer services  origination  storage  transportation and proprietary marketing strategies 
we will also continue to utilize our marketing expertise to enhance the value of our other energy assets  particularly our fuel and power generation assets 
we intend to operate our lines of business as utilities and non regulated energy groups 
the utilities group consists of electric and natural gas utility assets and services 
the non regulated energy group consists of fuel production  mid stream assets  power generation facilities and energy marketing 
the following are key elements of our business strategy complete the full  efficient integration of the five utility properties acquired in the aquila transaction  focusing on the achievement of operating synergies and cost reductions  provide stable long term rates for customers and increase earnings by efficiently planning  constructing and operating rate base power generation facilities needed to serve our electric utilities  proactively integrate alternative and renewable energy into our utility energy supply while remaining mindful of potential customer rate impacts  expand utility operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages  build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers of both our utilities and non regulated power generation businesses  selectively grow our non regulated power generation business in targeted western markets by developing assets and selling most of the capacity and energy production through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities  exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce and sell power at attractive margins  grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil in a cost effective manner  opportunistically expand our energy marketing operations including producer and end use origination services and  as warranted by market conditions  natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation opportunities  diligently manage the credit  price and operational risks inherent in buying and selling energy commodities  and maintain an investment grade credit rating and ready access to debt and equity capital markets 
complete the full  efficient integration of the five utility properties acquired in the aquila transaction  focusing on the achievement of operating synergies and cost reductions 
the july  acquisition of five utility properties in four states from aquila significantly expanded our regional presence and the size and scope of our utility operations 
the expanded utility operations will enhance our ability to serve customers and communities and build long term value for our shareholders 
over the next two years  we will continue working diligently to integrate the operations of the five acquired utilities with our other utility operations 
by standardizing processes  centralizing purchasing and inventory  and utilizing common computer systems for customer service  accounting  human resources and operations  it will be possible to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency 
provide stable long term rates for customers and increase earnings by efficiently planning  constructing and operating rate base power generation facilities needed to serve our electric utilities 
our company was originally a vertically integrated electric utility 
this business model remains a core strength and strategy today  where we invest in and operate efficient power generation resources to transmit and distribute electricity to our customers 
we provide power at reasonable and stable rates to our customers and earn competitive returns for our investors 
rate based generation assets offer several advantages for consumers  regulators and investors 
first  the assets assure consumers that rates have been reviewed and approved by government authorities who safeguard the public interest 
since the generating assets are included in the utility rate base  customer rates are more stable than if the power was purchased from the open market via wholesale contracts 
second  regulators participate in a planning process where long term investments are designed to match long term energy demand 
third  investors are assured that a long term  reasonable  stable rate of return may be earned on their investment 
a lower risk profile may also improve credit ratings which  in turn  can benefit both consumers and investors by lowering our cost of capital 
examples of our progress include the january completion of wygen ii to serve the customers of cheyenne light and the ongoing construction of wygen iii to serve the customers of black hills power 
in august  following the closing of the aquila transaction  we submitted to the colorado regulators a long term resource plan that included the proposed construction of up to five gas fired power plants  with a total capacity of approximately megawatts  to serve the customers of colorado electric 
hearings were completed in late january  and on february  the commission issued its initial decision 
the decision allows us to construct gas fired power plants representing approximately mw 
we will issue a request for proposal for the remaining mw with a bid due date in june under the process outlined by the commission in its decision  we may submit proposals to provide generation through our ipp business 
this initial commission decision and order is subject to requests by any party to the proceeding for reconsideration by the commission  which must be filed by march  proactively integrate alternative and renewable energy into our utility energy supply while remaining mindful of potential customer rate impacts 
the energy and utility industries face tremendous uncertainty related to the potential impact of legislation intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the use of renewable and other alternative energy sources 
to date  many states have enacted and others are considering some form of mandatory renewable energy standard requiring utilities to meet certain thresholds of renewable energy use 
additionally  many states have either enacted or are considering legislation setting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets 
federal legislation for both renewable energy standards and greenhouse gas emission reductions is also under consideration 
mandates for the use of renewable energy or the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will likely result in substantial increases in the prices for electricity and natural gas 
at the same time  however  as a regulated utility we are responsible for providing safe  reasonably priced  reliable sources of energy to our customers 
as a result  we have developed a customer centered strategy for renewable energy standards and greenhouse gas emission reductions that balances our customers rate concerns with environmental considerations 
we attempt to strike this balance by prudently and proactively incorporating renewable energy into our resource supply  while seeking to minimize rate increases for our utility customers 
examples of our balanced approach include with respect to states such as south dakota and wyoming that currently have no legislative mandate on the use of renewable energy  we have nevertheless integrated cost effective renewable energy into our generation supply on the expectation that there will be mandatory renewable energy standards in the future 
for example  in september  we commenced buying wind energy for use at black hills power and cheyenne light under a year power purchase agreement for approximately mw of wind energy located in cheyenne  wyoming  in states such as colorado and montana that do have a legislative mandate on the use of renewable energy  we are aggressively pursuing cost effective initiatives with the regulators that will allow us to accomplish our renewable energy requirements 
in colorado for instance  we recently filed an electric resource plan that includes enough renewable energy additions and greenhouse gas emission reductions to permit us to satisfy both i the state s requirement that of a utility s distributed energy must be supplied by renewable energy resources by and ii the governor s executive order that requires a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions  and in all states in which we conduct electric operations  we are exploring other potential biomass  solar and wind energy projects and evaluating other potential wind generator sites  particularly sites located near our utility service territories 
using reasonable assumptions  we have also carefully evaluated our coal fired generating facilities and the potential future economic impact of a carbon tax or cap and trade regime intended to reduce co emissions 
for customers in states without renewable or co mandates  such as south dakota and wyoming  we believe it is still in our utility customers long term interest to construct new mine mouth  coal fired generating facilities  such as our wygen ii generation facility completed in january and our wygen iii generation facility under construction 
in addition  we are actively evaluating alternative coal fired generation technologies  including igcc and carbon capture and sequestration  though both appear cost prohibitive in the near term 
these technologies may become cost effective in the future if the cost of co 

emissions reaches sufficiently high levels or further technological advancements reduce the costs of those technologies 
expand utility operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages 
for years  we have provided strong utility services  delivering quality and value to our customers 
our tradition of accomplishment supports efforts to expand our utility operations into other markets  most likely in the midwest  west and possibly other regions that permit us to take advantage of our intrinsic competitive advantages  such as baseload power generation  system reliability  superior customer service  community involvement and a relationship based approach to regulatory matters 
the acquisition of cheyenne light and the aquila transaction are examples of such expansion efforts 
utility operations also enhance other important business development  including gas transmission pipelines and storage infrastructure  which could promote other non regulated energy operations 
utility operations can contribute substantially to the stability of our long term cash flows  earnings and dividend policy 
although we do not expect to make any significant utility acquisitions in  some industry experts believe that the current financial turmoil and economic recession may produce opportunities for healthy utility companies to acquire utility assets and operations of less creditworthy companies upon attractive terms and conditions 
we would expect to consider such opportunities if we believe they would further our long term strategy and help maximize shareholder value 
build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers of both our utilities and non regulated power generation business 
we strive to build strong relationships with other utilities  municipalities and wholesale customers and believe we will continue to be a primary provider of electricity to wholesale utility customers 
we further believe that these entities will need products  such as capacity  in order to serve their customers reliably 
by providing these products under long term contracts  we are able to help our customers meet their energy needs 
through this approach  we also believe we can earn more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling energy into more volatile spot markets 
in addition  relationships that we ve established with wholesale power customers have developed into other opportunities 
mean and mdu  both wholesale power customers  will now also be our joint owners in power plants 
selectively grow our non regulated power generation business in targeted western markets by developing assets and selling most of the capacity and energy production through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities 
in late  we initiated an evaluation of the merits of divesting certain power generation assets 
that strategic review resulted in the mid divestiture of seven ipp plants for a total of million 
while much of our recent power plant development has been for our regulated utilities  we intend to continue to expand our non regulated power generation business by developing and operating power plants in regional markets based on prevailing supply and demand fundamentals in a manner that complements our existing fuel assets  and marketing capabilities 
we intend to grow this business through a combination of disciplined acquisitions and the development of new power generation facilities primarily in the western region where our detailed knowledge of market and electric transmission fundamentals gives us a competitive advantage  and  in turn  increases our ability to earn attractive returns 
we expect to prioritizesmall scale facilities that serve incremental growth  and are relatively easier to permit and construct than large scale generation projects 
most of the energy and capacity from our non regulated power facilities is sold under mid and long term contracts 
by doing so  we believe that we can satisfy the requirements of our customers while earning more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling our energy into the more volatile spot markets 
when possible  we structure long term contracts as tolling arrangements  whereby the contract counterparty assumes the fuel risk 
going forward  we will continue to focus on selling a majority of our unregulated capacity and energy primarily to load serving utilities under long term agreements that have been reviewed or approved by state utility commissions 
with respect to our current power sale agreements  two of our long term power contracts expire in and these contracts provide for the sale of capacity and energy to cheyenne light from our gillette ct and wygen i plants  respectively 
as part of our integrated resource planning efforts  a decision will be made regarding whether or not to extend or replace the contracts 
in anticipation of renewal or extension  a contract review process generally begins about two years in advance of expiration  and we would expect to proceed accordingly 
exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce and sell power at attractive margins 
we expect to selectively expand our portfolio of power plants which have relatively low marginal costs of producing energy and related products and services 
we intend to utilize a competitive power production strategy  together with access to coal and natural gas reserves  to be competitive as a power generator 
competitive production costs can result from a variety of factors  including low fuel costs  efficiency in converting fuel into energy  and low per unit operation and maintenance costs 
in addition  we typically operate our plants with high levels of availability  as compared to industry benchmarks 
we aggressively manage each of these factors with the goal of achieving low production costs 
one of our primary competitive advantages is our wrdc coal mine  which is located in reasonably close proximity to our electric utility service territories 
we attempt to exploit this competitive advantage by building additional mine mouth coal fired generating capacity  which allows us to substantially eliminate fuel transportation and storage costs 
this strengthens our position as a low cost producer because transportation costs often represent the largest component of the delivered cost of coal for many other utilities 
grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil in a cost effective manner 
our strategy is to cost effectively grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil through both organic growth and acquisitions 
while consistent growth remains our objective  we realize the necessity of managing for value over managing for growth and intend to be appropriately responsive to market conditions 
growth in our core areas in the rocky mountain region is a focus that we must balance with opportunities in plays or basins which are new to us 
in the short term  growth plans may be negatively impacted by the current economic crisis  and low crude oil and natural gas prices 
in the long term  however  we believe that demand will lead to higher product prices and opportunity for growth 
specifically  we plan to primarily focus on lower risk development and exploratory drilling  participate on a non operated basis with other operators to provide exposure to additional plays and producing basins  focus on various plays in the rocky mountain region  where we can more easily integrate with our existing oil and natural gas operations as well as our fuel marketing and or power generation activities  support the future capital requirements of our drilling program by stabilizing cash flows with a hedging program that mitigates commodity price risk for a substantial portion of our established production for up to years in the future  and enhance our oil and gas production activities with the construction or acquisition of mid stream gathering  compression and treating systems in a manner that maximizes the economic value of our operations 
opportunistically expand our energy marketing operations including producer and end use origination services and  as warranted by market conditions  natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation opportunities 
our energy marketing business seeks to provide services to producers and end users of natural gas and crude oil and to capitalize on market volatility by employing storage  transportation and proprietary trading strategies 
the service provider focus of our energy marketing activities largely differentiates us from other energy marketers 
through our producer services group  we assist mostly small to medium sized producers throughout the western united states with marketing and transporting their crude oil and natural gas 
through our origination services  we work with utilities  municipalities and industrial users of natural gas to provide customized delivery services  as well as to support their efforts to optimize their transportation and storage positions 
diligently manage the credit  price and operational risks inherent in buying and selling energy commodities 
all of our operations require effective management of counterparty credit risk 
we mitigate this risk by conducting business with a diversified group of creditworthy counterparties 
in certain cases where creditworthiness merits security  we require prepayment  secured letters of credit or other forms of financial collateral 
we establish counterparty credit limits and employ continuous credit monitoring with regular review of compliance under our credit policy by our executive credit committee 
our oil and gas  power generation and energy marketing operations require effective management of price and operational risks related to adverse changes in commodity prices and the volatility and liquidity of the commodity markets 
to mitigate these risks  we have implemented risk management policies and procedures  particularly for our marketing operations 
we have oversight committees that monitor compliance with our policies 
we also limit exposure to energy marketing risks by maintaining a credit facility separate from our corporate facility 
we had no counterparty credit losses in despite the economic turmoil 
maintain an investment grade credit rating and ready access to debt and equity capital markets 
access to capital will be critical to our future success 
we will require access to the capital markets to fund our planned capital investments or  when possible  to make strategic acquisitions that prudently grow our businesses 
in  disruption in worldwide capital markets was evidenced by diminished liquidity in the debt capital markets  significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk  and the failure of certain financial institutions 
despite actions of the united states federal government  these events have contributed to a general economic decline that is materially and adversely impacting the broader financial and credit markets  and reducing the availability of debt and equity capital 
our acquisition of additional utility properties in  combined with the divestiture of seven ipp plants  has lowered our overall corporate risk profile 
even so  our access to capital markets could be impacted by the conditions described above 
our access to adequate and cost effective financing also depends upon our ability to maintain our investment grade issuer credit rating 
notwithstanding these adverse market conditions  in late we extended the maturity date on the acquisition facility that was used to fund our purchase of utility properties from aquila 
the acquisition facility now expires on december  we anticipate that we will replace the acquisition facility with long term financing in prospective information we expect long term growth through the expansion of integrated  balanced and diverse energy operations 
we recognize that sustained growth requires near continual capital deployment 
the current condition of the capital markets will make it challenging to execute our strategy in the short term  but we are confident in our ability to obtain the necessary financing to continue our growth plans 
we are proactively taking prudent actions to modify our short term plans to address the current capital market uncertainties 
we will remain focused on managing our operations cautiously and maintaining our overall liquidity to meet our operating  capital and financing needs  as well as executing our long term strategic plan 
utilities group the aquila transaction significantly broadened our regional utility presence  more than doubled our employee count and resulted in a five fold increase in our utility customer base 
post close integration activities are being executed so that over the next to months  our workforces and systems will be combined to establish a platform upon which to continue growing our business and delivering value to our shareholders 
electric utilities business at black hills power remained strong in we began construction of the wygen iii power plant  which is planned for commercial operation by mid black hills power is expected to own of the facility s capacity as mdu has elected to purchase a ownership interest in the facility 
beginning january  we will benefit from newly increased transmission rates resulting from a recent ferc transmission rate case 
the new rate structure also includes a formula approach to rates that will allow us to recover our capital investment as the capital is spent on the related transmission infrastructure 
to accommodate both the load growth within the region and the addition of wygen iii  additional transmission infrastructure is planned over the next several years 
we are focused on colorado electric s pending energy resource plan that has been proposed to the cpuc 
among other matters  the resource plan addresses the replacement of a purchased power agreement with psco that currently supplies approximately of colorado electric s annual energy and capacity needs and expires at the end of the resource plan proposes the construction of up to five gas fired power plants to be placed in service at the beginning of the addition of any of these plants to our utility rate base would have a significant positive impact on our financial results 
gas utilities our gas utilities are focused on the continued investment and strengthening of our gas distribution system  which grows our utility rate base 
as further described in our utilities group regulation and rates discussion within item and business and properties  we have pending rate cases for iowa gas and colorado gas 
interim rates have been put in place in iowa and conclusion is expected for both cases during non regulated energy group power generation during january  we completed the sale of a interest in wygen i to mean for million 
we recognized a gain on the sale of approximately million after tax 
concurrently with this sale  we also terminated a year power purchase contract under which mean was obligated to buy mw of power and capacity from wygen i 
the decreased revenues associated with the terminated agreement will be partially replaced by agreements under which mean will pay for costs associated with administrative services  plant operations and coal supplied by our coal mining operation 
we plan to continue evaluating opportunities to bid generation resources  both new and existing  into the requests for proposals of other regional electric utilities for their energy and capacity needs 
coal mining production from the coal mining segment is expected to primarily serve mine mouth generation plants and select regional customers with long term fuel needs 
increased demand will come from additional mine mouth generation either currently being constructed or in various stages of development 
total annual production is estimated to be approximately million tons in  and increase by approximately million tons per year to serve the needs of the wygen iii plant in we experienced higher operating expenses in in part due to high diesel fuel costs 
while we expect to see lower prices for diesel fuel in this benefit will likely be offset by an increase in overburden production associated with the high overburden ratios in the current phase of our mine plan 
oil and gas we are focused on growing our oil and gas production through development of existing acreage and limited acquisitions based on economic and industry conditions 
during  we expect to limit our development capital to no more than the cash flows produced by our oil and gas properties 
the current economic conditions will be particularly challenging since low commodity prices make many of our development drilling sites uneconomical  which could further reduce our development capital expenditures 
the lower development capital expenditures will lead to lower production levels due to the natural production decline of existing wells 
at december  we recorded a million after tax ceiling test impairment charge to our oil and gas properties 
if the early low commodity price environment continues  we will likely incur an additional significant non cash ceiling test impairment charge as early as the first quarter of energy marketing we have a strong marketing portfolio with a significant amount of economic value that will be realized as the transactions settle over the next several years 
the addition of more long term transportation and storage contracts during has extended the duration of our marketing book 
while we expect to derive earnings from these contracts over many years  the required methods of accounting for these transactions could result in additional earnings volatility during the term of these contracts 
our earnings were positively impacted by unrealized mark to market gains that accelerated margins into from proprietary positions that will not settle until and we are currently pursuing a renewal of our uncommitted enserco facility prior to its may  expiration 
we intend to seek a committed facility to replace the current uncommitted facility 
given the current condition of the credit markets  until we renew the enserco facility and refinance certain of our other short term debt  we will conduct our enserco business operation in a manner to preserve liquidity  which includes minimizing utilization of the enserco facility 
this constraint on capital could restrict enserco s ability to take advantage of favorable transactions that may be available in the marketplace 
corporate we currently have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million  which no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment provided by sfas accordingly  all mark to market adjustments on these swaps are recorded through the income statement 
as of december   these swaps had a fair value of million which was recorded as an unrealized mark to market loss in our earnings 
fluctuations in interest rates create volatility in the fair value of these swaps which will likely have a significant impact on our earnings as we record the associated unrealized mark to market gains or losses within our income statement 
results of operations executive summary loss from continuing operations for the year was impacted by a million after tax non cash charge for a ceiling test impairment of oil and gas assets due to low crude oil and natural gas prices at the end of  lower margins from the energy marketing segment and a million after tax mark to market loss related to corporate interest rate swaps no longer designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
solid utility performance and increased earnings from the power generation segment partially offset the earnings decline 
results also reflect the impacts of the ipp transaction and the aquila transaction 
earnings for the utilities increased over the prior year 
earnings were impacted by the july  purchase date of the five utilities acquired in the aquila transaction  a rate increase effective at cheyenne light january  and increased mwh sales 
partially offsetting the increases were higher maintenance and depreciation costs associated with the mw coal fired wygen ii plant  placed in commercial service january   and lower afudc 
lower earnings from energy marketing were primarily attributable to a million pre tax decrease in realized marketing margins 
earnings were impacted by market conditions affecting both transportation and storage strategies as well as the effect of lower commodity prices on oil marketing margins 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in unrealized marketing margins 
power generation s improved earnings for are a result of increased earnings from equity investments as compared to and increased earnings from the gillette ct primarily due to lower gas and purchased power costs and maintenance expense 
the increase to earnings also reflects the impacts of a million after tax impairment charge for the ontario plant and a million after tax charge for a goodwill impairment in  higher allocated indirect corporate costs related to the ipp transaction and not reclassified to discontinued operations and lower investment partnership earnings  primarily as a result of a partnership impairment charge of the glenns ferry and rupert power plants in oil and gas segment earnings decreased primarily as a result of the million after tax ceiling test impairment charge  a decrease in production  and increased loe and depletion costs 
revenues increased due to a increase in the average hedged price of oil received and a increase in the average hedged price of gas received  partially offset by production decreases 
coal mining earnings decreased due to increased overburden expense  diesel fuel costs  depreciation expense and higher mineral taxes and royalties due to increased revenues and tons sold 
revenues increased due to a increase in tons of coal sold at a higher average price 
overview revenue and income loss from continuing operations provided by each business group were as follows in thousands revenue utilities non regulated energy corporate income loss from continuing operations utilities non regulated energy corporate the corporate results represent unallocated costs for administrative activities that support the business segments

in february  we entered into a definitive agreement with aquila to acquire its regulated electric utility assets in colorado and its regulated gas utilities in colorado  nebraska  iowa and kansas for million  subject to customary closing adjustments 
on july   we completed the acquisition 
the purchase price was financed through a million borrowing on our billion acquisition credit facility and from cash proceeds generated from our ipp transaction  which was completed on july  the results of operations for the acquired utilities have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
discontinued operations in  and represent the results of operations and gain on sale from the ipp transaction and the march sale of our crude oil marketing and transportation business

return on average common stock equity in and was and  respectively 
the utilities group income from continuing operations increased million in compared to results from the utilities group include the operations of the five utilities acquired in the aquila transaction since the july acquisition date 
earnings from continuing operations from the electric utilities increased million primarily due to an increase in retail rates and increased electricity sold to retail customers 
earnings from continuing operations from the gas utilities were million for the period july  through december  the non regulated energy group s loss from continuing operations was million in  compared to earnings of million in  primarily due to a million after tax ceiling test impairment at the oil and gas segment and lower earnings from energy marketing of million 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in power generation earnings of million  which includes the impact of increased earnings from investment partnerships and lower indirect corporate costs related to the ipp transaction 
consolidated revenues for were million higher than primarily due to the addition of the utilities acquired in the aquila transaction and increased oil and gas and coal mining revenues  partially offset by decreased revenues from energy marketing 
consolidated operating expenses for increased million compared to operating expenses were impacted by the million pre tax ceiling test impairment at the oil and gas segment  increased overburden removal costs at the coal mine  additional operating costs from the wygen ii plant placed into service in january  and the addition of operating costs of the acquired utilities since their acquisition date 
income from continuing operations was also impacted by a million pre tax mark to market loss related to interest rate swaps no longer designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
compared to consolidated income from continuing operations for was million  compared to million in  or per share in  compared to per share in income from discontinued operations was million  or per share  compared to income of million  or per share in results for include the million gain on the sale of the operating assets of the crude oil marketing and transportation business 
return on average common stock equity in and was and  respectively 
the utilities group income from continuing operations increased million in compared to earnings increased primarily due to an increase in retail rates and an increase in afudc and the associated tax benefits related to the construction of wygen ii 
the non regulated energy group s income from continuing operations increased million in  compared to  primarily due to increased earnings from energy marketing of million 
this increase was partially offset by lower power generation earnings of million primarily due to impairment charges and lower earnings from equity investments in unallocated corporate costs for increased million after tax  compared to the increase is primarily due to increased acquisition and integration costs for the aquila acquisition offset by lower interest expense which was allocated down to the subsidiary level in consolidated revenues for were million higher than due to increased revenues from the oil and gas  coal mining and energy marketing segments  partially offset by the electric utilities which had lower revenues primarily due to lower pca and gca pass through cost recovery rate adjustments 
consolidated operating expenses for increased million compared to increased operating expenses reflect increased compensation costs at the energy marketing segment  a million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  primarily due to increased depletion at the oil and gas segment  and a million increase in operations and maintenance expense 
the increased expenses were partially offset by a million decrease in fuel and purchased power primarily due to cost recovery adjustments 
income from continuing operations was also impacted by a million decrease in interest expense primarily due to the reduction of debt  using in part  proceeds from the issuance and sale of common stock  and the effect of interest capitalization during ongoing construction and development 
a discussion of operating results from our business segments follows 
the following business group and segment information does not include discontinued operations or intercompany eliminations

partially offsetting the increase to earnings was the following increased plant maintenance costs and depreciation expense of approximately million associated with the wygen ii plant placed into service january   and lower afudc compared to compared to income from continuing operations increased primarily due to the following purchased power costs decreased due to an decrease in electricity purchased at a lower average price  margins from wholesale off system sales increased  a million decrease in write off of uncollectible accounts  and lower property tax due to lower assessed property valuations 
partially offsetting the increases to earnings were the following revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in wholesale off system sales and the effects of fluctuations in cost of electricity and gas that flow through to revenues through cost recovery rate adjustments  partially offset by increased rates that went into effect january   and a million increase in interest expense due to increased borrowings and net of the capitalized interest component of afudc 
gas utilities operating results for the gas utilities are as follows for the period july  to december  in thousands revenue natural gas regulated other non regulated total sales cost of sales natural gas regulated other non regulated total cost of sales gross margin operating expenses operating income income from continuing operations and net income as part of the aquila transaction  we acquired gas utilities in colorado  nebraska  iowa and kansas 
natural gas demand is typically higher in the first and fourth quarters as it is typically used for residential and commercial heating 
the gas utilities have gcas that allow them to pass through the cost of gas to customers 
for this reason  we believe gross margins are a more useful performance measure than revenues as fluctuations in the cost of gas are passed through to revenues 
in june  iowa gas filed for a million rate increase 
interim rates were implemented on june  the iub issued an order extending the time limit for consideration of the general rate increase and has until july  to issue a decision on our rate request 
if interim rates exceed final approved rate  the difference plus interest will be refunded or credited to customers 
in june  colorado gas filed for a million rate increase 
on february   a settlement of the rate case for million was presented to an administrative law judge 
the administrative law judge will make a recommendation regarding the settlement to the cpuc

non regulated energy group oil and gas oil and gas operating results were as follows in thousands revenue operating expenses operating loss income income loss from continuing operations operating expenses included a million pre tax ceiling test impairment charge 
the following tables provide certain operating statistics for the oil and gas segment  crude oil and natural gas production bbls of oil sold mcf of natural gas sold mcf equivalent sales average price received gas mcf oil bbl net of hedge settlement gains losses exclusive of gas liquids average production cost per mcfe loe production and other taxes total depletion depletion expense mcfe the average depletion rate per mcfe is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented 
the rate was particularly impacted by product price volatility and significantly lower year end market prices  which resulted in lower oil and gas reserve quantities 
the following is a summary of annual average operating expenses per mcfe at december gathering gathering gathering compression compression compression and and and loe processing total loe processing total loe processing total new mexico colorado wyoming all other properties total at the east blanco field in new mexico and our piceance basin assets in colorado  we own and operate gas gathering systems  including associated compression and treating facilities 
the following is a summary of our proved oil and gas reserves at december bbls of oil in thousands mmcf of natural gas total mmcfe reserves are based on reports prepared by an independent consulting and engineering firm 
the reports were prepared by cawley  gillespie associates  inc in and  and ralph e 
davis associates  inc 
in reserves were determined using constant product prices at the end of the respective years 
estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net revenues are based on a number of variables  which may differ from actual results 
the current estimate takes into account production of approximately bcfe  additions from extensions  discoveries and acquisitions of bcfe and negative revisions to previous estimates of bcfe  including approximately bcfe due to lower product prices and higher costs 
reserves reflect year end pricing held constant for the life of the reserves  as follows oil gas oil gas oil gas year end prices nymex year end prices average well head compared to loss from continuing operations was million compared to income of million in the prior year  primarily due to the following 
a million after tax non cash ceiling test impairment charge was taken during the fourth quarter the write down in value of our natural gas and crude oil properties resulted from low year end prices for the commodities 
the write down of gas and oil properties was based on year end nymex prices of per mcf  adjusted to per mcf at the wellhead  for natural gas and per barrel  adjusted to per barrel at the wellhead  for crude oil  loe increased million due to costs related to severe weather conditions in new mexico  increased fuel costs and higher industry related costs  and increased depletion expense of million primarily due to negative reserve revisions driven by the impact of lower year end commodity prices 
partially offsetting these decreases were the following increased revenues of million primarily due to a increase in the annual average hedged price of oil received and a increase in the annual average hedged price of gas received  partially offset by a decrease in production and the impact of a royalty settlement with the jicarilla apache nation 
the decrease in production resulted from severe weather at the beginning of  federal drilling permit delays  voluntary shut in of volumes in response to low price levels at the cig pricing location and delays in drilling activity on our non operated property as well as a reduction in capital spending due to the low commodity prices 
in  we acquired additional non operated interest in a wyoming field in which we already held non operated interests 
the additional interest added approximately bcfe of proved reserves and is viewed as a long term production field with increased density and up hole re completion potential 
compared to income from continuing operations was comparable to the prior year 
revenues from oil and gas sales increased due to a increase in oil volumes at average prices received that were higher than prior year and increased gas sales of  at a higher average gas price received  operations and maintenance costs increased due to increases in the number of wells and higher industry costs for services and equipment  general and administrative costs increased primarily due to higher corporate allocations and increased labor costs resulting from staffing increases to support development of acquisitions  depletion per mcfe increased primarily due to increases in current year finding costs and forecasted future development costs and higher industry wide cost increases  and interest expense increased due to carrying a full year of piceance basin acquisition debt and increased borrowings to fund drilling and exploration activity

power generation our power generation segment produced the following results in thousands revenue operating expenses operating income income loss from continuing operations the following table provides certain operating statistics for the power generation segment independent power capacity mw of independent power capacity in service contracted fleet plant availability gas fired plants coal fired plants total compared to earnings from continuing operations increased million primarily due to increased earnings from our investment partnerships due to partnership impairment charges of million after tax for the glenns ferry and rupert power plants  in which we hold a ownership interest  increased operating income from our gillette ct of million after tax 
operating income was impacted by lower gas and purchased power costs and maintenance expense  allocated indirect corporate costs  related to the ipp assets sold and not reclassified to discontinued operations  decreased million after tax 
costs represent a partial year through the sale date of the ipp transaction  compared to a full months of costs in  and the recording of an impairment loss  and related costs  in of million after tax relating to the ontario plant 
partially offsetting the increased earnings was a decrease in non operating income of million after tax  resulting from a change in business segment debt to equity capital structure 
compared to income from continuing operations decreased million primarily due to the following decreased earnings of approximately million after tax due to the impairment of the ontario plant  and decreased equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of approximately million after tax due to the partnership impairment charges for the glenns ferry and rupert power plants  in which we hold a interest 
coal mining coal mining results were as follows in thousands revenue operating expenses operating income income from continuing operations the following table provides certain operating statistics for the coal mining segment in thousands tons of coal sold cubic yards of overburden moved coal reserves compared to income from continuing operations decreased million  or  due to the following increased overburden removal costs of million due to a increase in overburden yards moved  compounded by a higher strip ratio  longer haul distances and higher diesel fuel costs  and increased depreciation expense of million due to an increase in the asset base and usage related to increased production 
offsetting the decreases was a million increase in revenues due to a increase in coal sold at a higher average price 
the increase in coal volumes was due to additional wygen ii and train load out sales 
compared to income from continuing operations increased due to a increase in revenues  primarily due to increases in coal pricing  sales in december to the wygen ii plant for test power  which was placed into commercial service january   and lower revenues in due to scheduled and unscheduled outages at the wyodak plant 
partially offsetting the increased revenues and earnings were the following increased overburden removal costs due to a increase in cubic yards moved  increased royalty expense primarily due to the increase in revenues  and increased mining taxes primarily related to the increase in revenues and tons 
energy marketing our energy marketing segment produced the following results in thousands revenue realized gas marketing gross margin unrealized gas marketing gross margin realized oil marketing gross margin unrealized oil marketing gross margin operating expenses operating income income from continuing operations the following table provides certain operating statistics for the energy marketing segment natural gas average daily physical sales mmbtu crude oil average daily physical sales bbls compared to income from continuing operations decreased million due to the following a million pre tax decrease in realized marketing margins  primarily due to prevailing conditions in natural gas markets affecting both transportation and storage strategies  and lower crude oil marketing margins are due to the impact of decreasing commodity prices on inventory held to meet pipeline requirements 
partially offsetting the decrease was the following a million pre tax increase in unrealized marketing margins 
unrealized mark to market gains in were driven by accelerated margins within our proprietary trading portfolio and narrowing basis differentials at year end  resulting in mark to market gains on our hedged transportation positions 
these positions are scheduled to settle and the margins realized primarily in and to a lesser extent  and lower operating expenses as incentive compensation decreased compared to incentive compensation for strong marketing performance in compared to income from continuing operations increased million due to the following realized gross margins from gas marketing increased million over the prior year and physical gas volumes marketed increased  a full year of margins from oil marketing operations  which began in may  gas marketing unrealized mark to market gains were million higher  and lower professional fees as compared to cost incurred in related to litigation costs 
partially offsetting the earnings increase was the following increased tax expense for higher estimated occupation taxes  and increased compensation costs related to higher realized marketing margins 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
the following discussion of our critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note  business description and summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate for impairment  the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually for goodwill as required by sfas for long lived assets with finite lives  this evaluation is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the anticipated future cash flows over the expected useful life of the assets is less than the assets carrying value  then a permanent non cash write down equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and the assets fair value is required to be charged to earnings 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use a probability weighted average expected cash flow method with assumptions based on those used for internal budgets 
the determination of future cash flows  and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is by it nature a highly subjective judgment 
significant judgment assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the evaluation of our long lived assets 
according to sfas  goodwill and other intangibles are required to be evaluated whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually 
we conduct our annual evaluations during the fourth quarter 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment 
the underlying assumptions used for determining fair value are susceptible to change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about future revenues and operating costs  the amount and timing of anticipated capital expenditures for power generating facilities at our utility operations  discount rates  inflation rates  and economic conditions  require significant judgment 
the aquila transaction resulted in a significant increase in our goodwill balance 
as of december   our total goodwill relating to the aquila transaction was million 
regulatory accounting we account for certain regulated operations under the provisions of sfas as a result  we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under gaap for non regulated entities 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probably of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that either are not likely to or have yet to be incurred 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes  recent rate orders to other regulatory entities  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation issues 
these assessments reflect the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels  and are subject to change in the future 
unbilled utility revenues sales related to the delivery of energy are generally recorded when services or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of sales is based on reading customers meters  which occurs systematically throughout the month 
at the end of each month  an estimate is made of the amount of energy delivered to customers after the date of the last meter reading 
the unbilled revenue is calculated each month based on estimated customer usage  weather factors  line losses  and applicable customer rates 
total unbilled revenues at december  were million 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method whereby all productive and nonproductive costs related to acquisition  exploration and development drilling activities are capitalized 
these costs are amortized using a unit of production method based on volumes produced and proved reserves 
any conveyances of properties  including gains or losses on abandonments of properties  are treated as adjustments to the cost of the properties with no gain or loss recognized 
net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
this method values the reserves based upon actual oil and gas spot prices at the end of each reporting period adjusted for contracted price changes 
the prices  as well as costs and development capital  are assumed to remain constant for the remaining life of the properties 
if the net capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  then a permanent non cash write down is required to be charged to earnings in that reporting period 
our net capitalized costs were more than the full cost ceiling at december  requiring an after tax write down of million 
given the fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  we can provide no assurance that future write downs will not occur depending on oil and gas prices at that point in time 
on december   the sec issued final rules amending its oil and gas reporting requirements effective january  the final rule changes the use of prices at the end of each reporting period to an average of the first day of the month price for the preceding twelve months 
the sec has proposed to apply these rules to the annual reports on form k for the period ending december   however there is the possibility of delaying the compliance date until the fasb has issued final accounting standards in line with the sec rules 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
an independent petroleum engineering company prepares reports that estimate our proved oil and natural gas reserves annually 
the accuracy of any oil and natural gas reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as oil and gas prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in estimating our oil and natural gas reserves  the estimates are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense  the amortization rate of our capitalized oil and gas properties incorporates the estimated unit of production attributable to the estimates of proved reserves 
the net book value of our oil and gas properties is also subject to a ceiling limitation based in large part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
risk management activities in addition to the information provided below  see note risk management activities  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
derivatives we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas accounting for derivatives under sfas requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and their measurement at fair value 
our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative 
the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under sfas are recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or fair values 
the effective portion of changes in fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss until it is reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in current earnings 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized in current earnings along with fair value changes of the underlying hedged item 
we currently use derivative instruments  including options  swaps  futures  forwards and other contractual commitments for both non trading hedging and trading purposes 
our typical non trading hedging transactions relate to contracts we enter into to fix the price received for anticipated future production at our oil and gas segment  or to fulfill the annual winter hedging plan for our gas utilities see below  and for interest rate swaps we enter into to convert a portion of our variable rate debt  or associated variable rate interest payments  to a fixed rate 
our energy marketing operations utilize various physical and financial contracts to effectively manage our marketing and trading portfolios 
fair values of derivative instruments and energy trading contracts are based on actively quoted market prices or other external source pricing information  where possible 
if external market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors and pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recorded  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future 
to the extent financial contracts have extended maturity dates  our estimates of fair value may involve greater subjectivity due to the lack of transparent market data available upon which to base modeling assumptions 
as allowed by state regulatory commissions  we have entered into certain financial instruments to reduce our customers underlying exposure to fluctuations in gas prices 
these financial instruments are considered derivatives under sfas and are marked to market 
we apply the provisions of sfas to periodic changes in fair value of the derivatives associated with these instruments and record an offset in regulatory asset or regulatory liability accounts 
most of our contracts for purchase and sale of natural gas qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale exceptions under sfas  and are not required to be recorded as derivative assets and liabilities 
counterparty credit risk and allowance for doubtful accounts our largest counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies 
this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market  economic or regulatory conditions 
recent adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the short term capital markets  which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and collateral requirements under certain circumstances  including the use of master netting agreements in our natural gas marketing segment 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
the allowances provided are estimated and may be impacted by economic  market and regulatory conditions  which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and significantly impact future results of operations 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and established provisions  we can provide no assurance that our credit losses will be consistent with our estimates 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  has three defined benefit pension plans and three defined benefit post retirement healthcare plans 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions  the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of future increases in compensation levels  and healthcare cost projections 
the determination of our obligation and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the assumptions used by actuaries in calculating the amounts 
through  we reviewed the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a september measurement date 
effective in  we changed our measurement date to december although we believe our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
the pension benefit cost for for our non contributory funded pension plan is expected to be million compared to million in the estimated discount rate used to determine annual benefit cost accruals will be in  the discount rate used in was 
in selecting the discount rate  we consider cash flow durations for each plan s liabilities and returns on high credit quality fixed income yield curves for comparable durations 
our pension plan assets are held in trust and primarily consist of equity  fixed income and real estate securities 
in  our target long term investment allocations were equity and fixed income 
as a result of the severe decline in equity values in the fourth quarter of and in light of the improved relative value of fixed income investment opportunities  we are undergoing a review to consider a revision of the pension plan investment allocations 
the revision is expected to result in a higher fixed income allocation 
until the investment allocation review is completed and implemented  we have suspended our practice of rebalancing the portfolio on a quarterly basis 
this has resulted in an investment allocation of equities  fixed income cash and real estate at december  as of december   our average assumed discount rate was and our average expected return on plan assets was 
we do not pre fund our non qualified pension plans or two of the three postretirement benefit plans 
the table below shows the expected impacts of a increase or decrease to our discount rate assumption change in impact on december  impact on assumed discount accumulated postretirement service and rate benefit obligation interest cost in thousands increase decrease contingencies when it is probable that an environmental or other legal liability has been incurred  a loss is recognized when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the probability and the amount of loss are made based on currently available facts 
accounting for contingencies requires significant judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to potential liability 
our assessment of our exposure to contingencies could change to the extent there are additional future developments  or as more information becomes available 
if actual obligations incurred are different from our estimates  the recognition of the actual amounts could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized  at currently enacted income tax rates  to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and provides any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if we determine that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretations of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources overview information about our financial position as of december is presented in the following table percentage financial position summary change in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term debt long term debt stockholders equity ratios long term debt ratio total debt ratio we believe that our cash on hand  operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacity and ability to complete new debt financings  taken as a whole  provide sufficient resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements  debt maturities  anticipated dividends  and anticipated capital expenditures during the next months  however  a material change in available financing including further changes resulting from the ongoing financial crisis could impact our ability to fund our current liquidity and capital resource requirements 
liquidity historically  our principal sources of short term liquidity have been our revolving credit facilities and cash from operations 
we have utilized availability under our revolving credit facilities to manage our cash flows  principally due to the seasonality of our utility businesses and changes in the trading volumes of our energy marketing operation 
our principal sources of long term liquidity have been proceeds raised from public and private offerings of equity and long term debt securities issued by the company and its subsidiaries 
we have also managed liquidity needs through hedging activities  primarily in connection with seasonal needs of our utility operations including seasonal peaks in fuel requirements  interest rate movements  and commodity price movements 
as a result of the recent turmoil in the capital and credit markets  we expect to improve our liquidity profile by deferring or curtailing discretionary capital expenditures and operate certain of our businesses in a manner that conserves cash 
at december   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash on hand  and had million of cash borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under our credit facilities  as set forth below 
borrowings and letters of credit maximum issued at credit facility expiration capacity december  in millions unsecured revolving credit facility may  enserco facility may  credit facilities corporate credit facility in july  our unsecured revolving credit facility was increased from million to million 
the cost of borrowing or letters of credit under our corporate revolver is determined based on our credit ratings 
at our current ratings levels  the facility has an annual facility fee of basis points  and has a borrowing spread of basis points over libor which equates to a one month borrowing rate as of december  
the revolver can be used to fund our working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
at december   we had borrowings of million and million of letters of credit issued under the facility  and we had approximately million of capacity available for additional borrowings or letters of credit 
our revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  such as limitations on the creation of new indebtedness and on certain liens  restrictions on certain transactions  and maintenance of the following financial covenants i a consolidated net worth in an amount of not less than the sum of million and of our aggregate consolidated net income beginning january   ii a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to for the first year after the aquila transaction and  thereafter  a ratio not to exceed to  and  iii an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than to subject to applicable cure periods  a violation of any of these covenants would constitute an event of default that entitles the lenders to terminate their remaining commitments and accelerate all principal and interest outstanding 
at december   our consolidated net worth was  million  which was approximately million in excess of the net worth we were required to maintain under the credit facility 
at december   our long term debt ratio was  our total debt leverage long term debt and short term debt was  our recourse leverage ratio was approximately and our interest expense coverage ratio for the twelve month period ended december  was to accordingly  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants in the revolving credit facility as of december  in addition to covenant violations  an event of default under the credit facility may be triggered by other events  such as a failure to make payments when due or a failure to make payments when due in respect of  or a failure to perform obligations relating to  other debt obligations of million or more 
subject to applicable cure periods none of which apply to a failure to timely pay indebtedness  an event of default would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the credit facility for loans or new letters of credit  and could require both the immediate repayment of any principal and interest outstanding and the cash collateralization of outstanding letter of credit obligations 
the credit facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends if a default or an event of default exists prior to  or would result after giving effect to such action 
enserco facility our energy marketing subsidiary  enserco  has a million uncommitted  discretionary line of credit to provide support for the purchase  sale  transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil 
the line of credit is secured by enserco s assets  and it expires on may  the enserco credit facility allows for the issuance of letters of credit and loans for our marketing operations 
the cost of letters of credit issued under the facility is determined by the type of transaction the letter of credit is securing and ranges from an annualized cost of basis points to basis points 
we have not historically used the facility for loans 
outstanding borrowings accrue interest at the higher of basis points above the federal funds rate at december  or basis points above prime at december  
the maximum aggregate amount of such letters of credit and loans issued under the facility is subject to a borrowing base sublimit 
the sublimit is determined based on the net working capital and tangible net worth of enserco 
loans under the facility are subject to a maximum sublimit of million 
at december   million of letters of credit were issued under the facility and there were no cash borrowings outstanding 
acquisition facility in july  in conjunction with the closing of the aquila transaction  we borrowed million under our billion bridge acquisition credit facility dated may  the acquisition facility was structured as a single draw term loan facility for the sole purpose of financing the aquila transaction and following our july borrowing we have no additional borrowing capacity available under the facility 
borrowings under the term loan are available under a base rate option  which is based on the then current prime rate  or under a libor option  which is based on the then current libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for libor borrowings was originally basis points during the period from the initial funding under the term loan to six months thereafter  basis points during the period from six months and one day after the initial funding to nine months thereafter  and basis points during the period from nine months and one day after the initial funding until the loan maturity 
the loan was originally scheduled to mature on february  however  on december   we amended the facility to provide as follows the maturity date was extended from february  to december the applicable margin for base rate borrowings was increased to i basis points for the period commencing december  through march   ii basis points for the period commencing april  through june   iii basis points for the period commencing july  through september   and iv basis points thereafter 
if our credit ratings  as assigned by s p and moody s  fall below investment grade credit ratings  the applicable margin will increase by an additional basis points  and increased the applicable margin for libor borrowings to i basis points for the period commencing december  through march   ii basis points for the period commencing april  through june   iii basis points for the period commencing july  through september   and iv basis points thereafter 
if our credit ratings  as assigned by s p and moody s  fall below investment grade credit ratings and the applicable margin will increase by basis points 
in connection with the amendment  we also received the consents necessary to replace the administrative agent abn amro bank and appointed the royal bank of scotland plc as successor agent 
as of december   the facility has a borrowing spread of basis points over libor which equates to a one month borrowing rate as of december  
the acquisition facility also includes certain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that largely replicate the covenants in our corporate revolving credit facility 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  cross default provisions our revolving credit facility and acquisition term loan facility contain cross default provisions that would result in an event of default under the credit facility upon i a failure by us or certain of our subsidiaries including  among others  enserco and most of our utility subsidiaries to timely pay indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of million or more  or ii the occurrence of a default under any agreement under which we or certain of our subsidiaries including  among others  enserco and most of our utility subsidiaries may incur indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of million or more  and such default continues for a period of time sufficient to permit an acceleration of the maturity of such indebtedness or a mandatory prepayment of such indebtedness 
in addition  each of our credit facilities contains default provisions under which an event of default would result if we or certain of our subsidiaries including  among others  enserco and most of our utility subsidiaries fail to timely make certain payments  such as erisa funding obligations or payments in satisfaction of judgments  in an aggregate principal amount of million or more 
working capital the most significant activities impacting working capital are our capital expenditures and the purchase of natural gas for our gas utilities 
we could experience significant working capital requirements during peak months of the winter heating season due to higher natural gas consumption and during periods of high natural gas prices 
we anticipate using the combination of credit capacity available under our corporate revolver and cash on hand to meet our peak winter working capital requirements 
collateral as of december   we had posted with counterparties the following amounts in thousands of collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit trading positions energy marketing utility cash collateral requirements total funds on deposit collateral requirements for our trading positions will fluctuate based on the movement in commodity prices and our credit rating 
changes in collateral requirements will vary depending on the magnitude of the price movement and the current position of our energy marketing trading portfolio 
as these trading positions settle in the future  the collateral will be returned 
we are required to post collateral with certain commodity and pipeline transportation vendors 
this amount will fluctuate depending on gas prices and projected volumetric deliveries 
debt retirement transactions in  we entered into a credit agreement under which floating rate debt was issued to finance the wygen i project 
the project debt matured in june we retired the million of project debt with cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
see off balance sheet arrangements variable interest entities below for additional information 
in conjunction with the completion of the ipp transaction  million of project debt relating to certain colorado ipp facilities was retired in july we used proceeds from the ipp transaction to retire this debt 
utility money pool as a utility holding company  we are required to establish a cash management program to address lending and borrowing activities between our utility subsidiaries and the company 
we have established utility money pool agreements which address these requirements 
these agreements are on file with ferc and appropriate state regulators 
under the utility money pool agreements  our utilities may borrow and extend short term loans to our other utilities via a utility money pool at market based rates 
while the utility money pool may borrow funds from the company as ultimate parent company  the money pool arrangement does not allow loans from our utility subsidiaries to the company as ultimate parent company or to non regulated affiliates 
at december   internal borrowings outstanding within our utility money pool included in thousands borrowings outstanding at utility subsidiary december  black hills utility holdings black hills power cheyenne light registration statements our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of million shares of common stock  par value  and million shares of preferred stock  no par value 
as of december   we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  and no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
the company has an effective automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we may issue  from time to time  senior debt securities  subordinated debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants and other securities 
although the shelf registration statement does not limit our issuance capacity  our ability to issue securities is limited to the authority granted by our board of directors  certain covenants in our finance arrangements and restrictions imposed by federal and state regulatory authorities 
as of december   we had not issued any securities under this shelf registration statement 
anticipated financing plans enserco facility we are currently pursuing a renewal of the million enserco facility with our existing lenders and other banks prior to its may  expiration 
we also intend to change the facility to a committed facility upon its renewal 
because of the uncommitted nature of the existing enserco facility  and given the current condition of the credit markets  we are conducting our enserco business operations in a manner to preserve liquidity  which includes minimizing our utilization of the facility 
the enserco facility may be impacted by the current global credit crisis 
the credit crisis is prompting most commercial banks to reduce their commitments or deleverage their portfolios 
consequently  some of the participating banks in the enserco facility may decline to participate in new credit transactions going forward 
if a bank declined to participate in the facility  the existing issued letters of credit would remain in place  however  the remaining capacity available would be reduced by that bank s pro rata participation under the facility for future transactions 
the two largest participating banks under the enserco facility are fortis capital corp 
and bnp paribas  which have participation levels of million and million  respectively 
in october  bnp paribas announced that it had agreed to acquire fortis operations in belgium and luxembourg and its international banking franchises  including fortis capital corp 
in february  the fortis shareholders voted down the proposed transaction 
consequently  we cannot predict whether the two entities will continue to participate in the enserco facility at their current levels  regardless of whether or not a potential transaction is completed 
factors influencing liquidity due to recent market conditions and the decline in the fair value of our pension plan assets  the funding status of our pension plan in is likely to deteriorate as compared to the final determination of pension plan contributions for and future periods is subject to multiple variables  most of which are beyond our control  including further changes to the fair value of the pension assets and changes in actuarial assumptions in particular  the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation 
as a result  we may be required to contribute material amounts to our pension plans in and future periods  which could materially affect our liquidity and results of operations 
many of our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow 
we have traditionally sourced i variations in the working capital needs of our subsidiaries with cash on hand and capacity available under our credit facilities  and ii the capital expenditures of our subsidiaries through a combination of internally generated cash and equity contributions to our subsidiaries from us financed primarily with net proceeds of equity and long term debt issuances by us and  in limited instances  debt offerings by our subsidiaries 
increased volatility in commodity prices and interest rates  magnified by the recent turmoil in the bank and capital markets  has made it more difficult for us to adequately forecast the liquidity needs of our subsidiary operations and our ability to raise capital for our subsidiaries on reasonable terms 
moreover  based on general market conditions and various predictions of a prolonged recession  we face an increasing risk of higher payment defaults by our customers 
as a result  our liquidity needs are subject to greater fluctuation and are more difficult to forecast than in the past 
to the extent we issue long term debt securities or arrange new credit facilities or extensions of existing credit lines in the bank loan market  we expect to pay significant fees in connection with these activities 
in particular  future banking fees for new credit facilities or additional maturity extensions may be significantly more costly 
although our utility operations are subject to regulatory lag in terms of recovering capital expenditures and other prudently incurred costs  revenues from our utility operations traditionally have been stable 
in light of volatile commodity prices and the potential of a severe economic recession  our cash flows from utility operations could be less stable going forward 
as a utility holding company which owns several regulated utilities  we are subject to various regulations that could influence our liquidity 
for example  the issuance of debt by our utility subsidiaries including the ability of black hills utility holdings to issue debt and the use of our utility assets as collateral generally requires the prior approval of the state regulators in the state in which the utility assets are located 
as a result of our holding company structure  our right as a common shareholder to receive assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is junior to the claims against the assets of such subsidiaries by their creditors 
therefore  our holding company debt obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future claims of the creditors of our subsidiaries  including trade creditors  debt holders  secured creditors  taxing authorities  and guarantee holders 
credit ratings credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financing  and vendor payment terms  including collateral requirements 
as of december   our senior unsecured credit ratings  as assessed by the three major credit rating agencies  were as follows rating agency rating outlook moody s baa stable s p bbb stable fitch bbb stable in addition  the first mortgage bonds issued by black hills power were rated at december  as follows rating agency rating outlook moody s baa stable s p bbb stable fitch a stable we do not have any trigger events ie  an acceleration of repayment of outstanding indebtedness  an increase in interest costs or the posting of additional cash collateral tied to our stock price and have not executed any transactions that require us to issue equity based on our credit ratings or other trigger events 
if our senior unsecured credit rating should drop below investment grade  pricing under our credit agreements would be affected  increasing annual interest expense pre tax by approximately million based on our december  debt balances 
we have an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million which has collateral requirements based upon our corporate credit ratings 
at our current credit ratings  we would be required to post collateral for any amount by which the swap s negative mark to market fair value exceeds million 
if our senior unsecured credit rating would drop to bb or below by s p  or ba or below by moody s  we would be required to post collateral for the entire amount of the swap s negative market to market fair value 
capital requirements our primary capital requirements for the three years ended december were as follows in thousands acquisition costs payment for acquisition of net assets  net of cash acquired property additions utilities electric utilities gas utilities non regulated energy oil and gas power generation coal mining energy marketing corporate discontinued operations investing activities common stock dividends maturities redemptions of long term debt discontinued operations financing activities cash paid for the aquila properties  net of cash acquired

includes million for aquila acquisition and development costs 
includes million and million in and  respectively  for the construction of the valencia plant  which was sold in the ipp transaction 
our capital additions for were million  exclusive of the million payment for the aquila transaction 
capital expenditures were primarily for construction of the wygen iii power plant  acquisition of non operated oil and gas interests in wyoming  development drilling of oil and gas properties  increased coal mining equipment and maintenance capital 
our capital additions for were million 
capital expenditures were primarily for the construction of the wygen ii power plant  the valencia power plant  which is reclassified to discontinued operations  development drilling of oil and gas properties  capitalized costs associated with the aquila transaction  and maintenance capital 
our capital additions for were million 
capital expenditures were primarily for construction of the wygen ii power plant  acquisitions and development drilling of oil and gas properties  and maintenance capital 
forecasted capital expenditures forecasted capital requirements for maintenance capital and development capital are as follows in thousands utilities electric utilities gas utilities non regulated energy oil and gas power generation coal mining energy marketing corporate electric utilities capital requirements include approximately million and million for the development of the wygen iii coal fired plant in and  respectively 
forecasted expenditures assume we retain a ownership interest in the plant 
electric utilities capital requirements include approximately million for wygen iii related transmission projects in capital expenditures for our electric utilities do not include any expenditures associated with our pending colorado electric energy resource plan 
this plan proposes construction of up to five gas generating plants to serve the colorado electric customers 
development capital for our oil and gas properties is expected to be limited to no more than the cash flows produced by those properties 
continued low commodity prices make many of our development drilling sites uneconomical  which could further reduce our development capital expenditures 
contractual obligations and commitments the following information is provided to summarize our cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt a b unconditional purchase obligations c operating lease obligations d capital leases e other long term obligations f employee benefit plans g liability for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with fin h credit facilities i total contractual cash obligations j a long term debt amounts do not include discounts or premiums on debt

the energy charge under the purchase power agreement and the commodity price under the gas purchase contract are variable costs  which for purposes of estimating our future obligations  were based on costs incurred during and price assumptions using existing prices at december  the pricing for the psco power purchase agreement is based on annual contracted capacity and an load factor at current ferc approved rates 
our transmission obligations are based on filed tariffs as of december  actual future costs under the variable rate contracts may differ materially from the estimates used in the above table 
d includes operating leases associated with several office buildings and call centers  a lease for compressor equipment and vehicle leases 
e represents a capital lease on office equipment 
f includes our asset retirement obligations associated with our oil and gas  coal mining and electric and gas utilities segments as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
g represents estimated employer contributions to employee benefit plans through the year h years includes an estimated reversal of approximately million of gain deferred from the tax treatment related to the ipp transaction and the aquila transaction 
i includes million on our corporate credit facility and million on our acquisition facility 
j amounts in the above table exclude any obligation that may arise from our derivatives  including interest rate swaps and commodity related contracts that have a negative fair value at december  these amounts have been excluded as it is impracticable to reasonably estimate the final amount and or timing of any associated payments 
dividends our dividend payout ratio for the year ended december   was compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
dividends paid on our common stock totaled per share in  as compared to per share in and per share in our three year annualized dividend growth rate was  and all dividends were paid out of operating cash flows 
in january  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share 
if this dividend is maintained throughout  it will be equivalent to per share 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid will depend upon  among other things  our financial condition  funds from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictions under our credit facilities and our future business prospects 
due to our holding company structure  substantially all of our operating cash flow is provided by dividends paid or distributions made by our subsidiaries 
as a result  certain statutory limitations could affect dividend levels 
under the federal power act  a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in capital accounts 
the cash to pay dividends to our shareholders is derived in part from dividends received from our utility subsidiaries 
our utility subsidiaries are generally limited in the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory authorities to be paid to us as a utility holding company 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide various guarantees supporting certain of our subsidiaries under specified agreements or transactions 
at december   we had guarantees totaling million in place 
of the million  million was related to performance obligations under subsidiary contracts and million was related to indemnification for reclamation and surety bonds of subsidiaries 
for more information on these guarantees  see note to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
as of december   we had the following guarantees in place in thousands outstanding at year nature of guarantee december  expiring guarantee obligations of enserco under an agency agreement guarantees for payment of obligations arising from commodity related physical and financial transactions by black hills utility holdings ongoing indemnification for subsidiary reclamation surety bonds ongoing variable interest entities in  our black hills wyoming subsidiary entered into an agreement with wygen funding  limited partnership the variable interest entity to lease the wygen i plant 
we were considered the primary beneficiary of this arrangement and  therefore  we included the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
the initial term of the lease was five years and included a purchase option equal to the adjusted acquisition cost  which was essentially equal to the cost of the plant 
we guaranteed the obligations of black hills wyoming under the lease agreement 
at the end of the initial lease term in june  we elected to purchase the wygen i plant at an adjusted acquisition cost of million 
in conjunction with this purchase  we retired million of wygen i project debt through borrowings on our revolving credit facility  and extinguished the million guarantee obligation under the wygen i lease 
since the plant and its financial activities were previously consolidated into our financial statements  the transaction had minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements 
cash flow activities cash flows from operations of million decreased million from the prior year amount  affected by a million decrease in income from continuing operations and by the following a million decrease in cash flows from the change in operating assets and liabilities 
the primary changes include changes in working capital accounts and current tax effects of both the ipp transaction and the aquila transaction  higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million  a million pre tax unrealized loss related to interest rate swaps marked to market through earnings  and a million pre tax ceiling test impairment charge to write down the net carrying value of our natural gas and crude oil properties due to low year end commodity prices 
we had cash outflows from investing activities of million  including the acquisition costs of million for the aquila transaction  and approximately million of property  plant and equipment additions 
significant additions during included approximately million for wygen iii  approximately million for development drilling at our oil and gas properties  and million for the acquisition of an additional non operated interest in a wyoming oil and gas property 
partially offsetting the cash outflows from investing activities was million of cash received for the ipp transaction 
we had cash inflows from financing activities of million primarily due to the following a million increase in borrowings under the acquisition facility  in conjunction with the aquila transaction  and a million increase in borrowings on our revolving bank facility 
partially offsetting the cash inflows from financing activities were the following the payment of million of cash dividends on common stock  repayment of million of long term debt  including million for the wygen i project level debt  and repayment of million for colorado ipp project level debt  which was retired as part of the ipp transaction and is included in financing activities of discontinued operations 
in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs  to pay dividends on common stock  to pay our scheduled long term debt maturities and to fund a portion of our property additions 
cash flows from operations of million decreased million from the prior year amount  affected by a million increase in income from continuing operations and the following a million increase in cash flows from the change in current operating assets and liabilities 
this was primarily driven by decreases in cash flow resulting from changes in net accounts receivable and accounts payable  which were more than offset by million more in cash flows due to changes in materials  supplies and fuel during the year 
fluctuations in our materials  supplies and fuel balances were largely the result of natural gas inventory held by our energy marketing company in the form of storage agreements  a million decrease from the net change in derivative assets and liabilities primarily from derivatives associated with normal operations of our gas and oil marketing business and related commodity price fluctuations  higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million  and a decrease in cash flows resulting from the change in net regulatory assets and liabilities of million primarily related to fuel cost adjustments for cheyenne light 
we had cash outflows from investing activities of million  including approximately million for construction expenditures for wygen ii  expenditures associated with oil and gas properties of approximately million  capitalized costs of approximately million related to the aquila acquisition  approximately million for construction expenditures for wygen iii  approximately million of property  plant and equipment additions including ongoing maintenance capital in the normal course of business  and approximately million for construction expenditures for the valencia ipp plant  which is included in investing activities of discontinued operations 
we had cash inflows from financing activities of million primarily due to the following cash proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock  and cash proceeds of million from the issuance of first mortgage bonds by cheyenne light 
partially offsetting the cash inflows from financing activities were the following net payment of million on our credit facility  payment of million of cash dividends on common stock  and payment of million including the call of our outstanding debt with ge capital of million  as well as long term debt maturities 
market risk disclosures our activities expose us to a number of risks in the normal operation of our businesses 
depending on the activity  we are exposed to varying degrees of market risk and counterparty risk 
we have developed policies  processes  systems  and controls to manage and mitigate these risks 
market risk is the potential loss that might occur as a result of an adverse change in market price or rate 
we are exposed to the following market risks commodity price risk associated with our marketing business  our natural long position with crude oil and natural gas reserves and production  and fuel procurement for certain of our gas fired generation assets  interest rate risk associated with our variable rate credit facilities and our project financing floating rate debt as described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements  and foreign currency exchange risk associated with our natural gas marketing business transacted in canadian dollars 
our exposure to these market risks is affected by a number of factors including the size  duration  and composition of our energy portfolio  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices  the volatility of these prices and rates  and the liquidity of the related interest rate and commodity markets 
to manage and mitigate these identified risks  we have adopted the bhcrpp 
these policies have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
these policies include governance  control infrastructure  authorized commodities and trading instruments  prohibited activities  employee conduct  etc 
the executive risk committee  which includes senior level executives  meets on a regular basis to review our business and credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the authorized policies 
trading activities natural gas and crude oil marketing we have a natural gas and crude oil marketing business specializing in producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing that conducts business in the western and mid continent regions of the united states and canada 
for producer services our main objective is to provide value in the supply chain by acting as the producer s marketing arm for wellhead purchases  scheduling services  imbalance management  risk management services and transportation management 
we accomplish this goal through industry experience  extensive contacts  transportation and risk management expertise  trading skills and personal attention 
our end use origination efforts focus on supplying and providing electricity generators and industrial customers with flexible options to procure their energy inputs and asset optimization services to these large end use consumers of natural gas 
our wholesale marketing activity has two functions support the efforts of producer services and end use origination groups  and marketing and trading natural gas and crude oil 
to effectively manage our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing portfolios  we enter into forward physical commodity contracts  financial derivative instruments including over the counter swaps and options and storage and transportation agreements 
we conduct our gas marketing business activities within the parameters as defined and allowed in the bhcrpp and further delineated in the gas marketing risk management policies and procedures as approved by our executive risk committee 
monitoring and reporting market risk exposures we use a number of quantitative tools to measure  monitor and limit our exposure to market risk in our natural gas and oil marketing portfolio 
we limit and monitor our market risk through established limits on the nominal size of positions based on type of trade  location and duration 
such limits include those on fixed price  basis  index  storage  transportation and foreign exchange positions 
our market risk limits are monitored by our risk management function to ensure compliance with our stated risk limits 
the risk management function operates independently from our energy marketing group 
the limits are measured  monitored and regularly reported to and reviewed by our executive risk committee 
daily risk management activities include reviewing positions in relation to established position limits  assessing changes in daily mark to market and other non statistical risk management techniques 
the contract or notional amounts  terms and mark to market values of our natural gas and crude oil marketing and derivative commodity instruments at december  and  are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
non regulated trading activities the following table provides a reconciliation of activity in our natural gas and crude oil marketing portfolio that has been recorded at fair value including market value adjustments on inventory positions that have been designated as part of a fair value hedge during the year ended december  in thousands total fair value of energy marketing positions marked to market at december   a net cash settled during the period on positions that existed at december  change in fair value due to change in assumptions unrealized gain on new positions entered during the period and still existing at december  realized loss on positions that existed at december  and were settled during the period change in cash collateral b unrealized loss on positions that existed at december  and still exist at december  total fair value of energy marketing positions at december   a a the fair value of energy marketing positions consists of derivative assets liabilities held at fair value in accordance with sfas and market value adjustments to natural gas inventory that has been designated as a hedged item as part of a fair value hedge in accordance with sfas  as follows in thousands december  december  net derivative assets cash collateral market adjustment recorded in material  supplies and fuel b we adopted fsp fin effective january  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
therefore  the above reconciliation does not present a complete picture of our overall portfolio of trading activities or our expected cash flows from energy trading activities 
in our natural gas and crude oil marketing operations  we often employ strategies that include utilizing derivative contracts along with inventory  storage and transportation positions to accomplish the objectives of our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing groups 
except in circumstances when we are able to designate transportation  storage or inventory positions as part of a fair value hedge  sfas generally does not allow us to mark our inventory  transportation or storage positions to market 
the result is that while a significant majority of our energy marketing positions are fully economically hedged  we are required to mark some parts of our overall strategies the derivatives to market value  but are generally precluded from marking the rest of our economic hedges transportation  inventory or storage to market 
volatility in reported earnings and derivative positions should be expected given these accounting requirements 
we adopted the provisions of sfas on january  sfas provides a single definition of fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
we use the fair value methodology outlined in sfas to value the assets and liabilities for our outstanding derivative contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the sources of fair value measurements were as follows in thousands maturities source of fair value less than year years total fair value level level level market value adjustment for inventory see footnote a above total the following table presents a reconciliation of our energy marketing positions recorded at fair value under gaap to a non gaap measure of the fair value of our energy marketing forward book wherein all forward trading positions are marked to market december  december  in thousands fair value of our energy marketing positions marked to market in accordance with gaap see footnote a above market value adjustments for inventory  storage and transportation positions that are not marked to market under gaap fair value of all forward positions non gaap cash collateral included in gaap marked to market fair value liquidity reserve included in gaap marked to market fair value fair value of all forward positions excluding cash collateral and liquidity reserve non gaap in accordance with gaap and industry practice prior to the issuance of sfas  we included a liquidity reserve in our gaap marked to market fair value 
this liquidity reserve accounted for the estimated impact of the bid ask spread in a liquidation scenario under which we are forced to liquidate our forward book on the balance sheet date 
as a result of our adoption of sfas  the company discontinued its use of a liquidity reserve in valuing the total forward position within its energy marketing portfolio 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
activities other than trading oil and gas exploration and production we produce natural gas and crude oil through our exploration and production activities 
our reserves are natural long positions  or unhedged open positions  and introduce commodity price risk and variability in our cash flows 
we employ risk management methods to mitigate this commodity price risk and preserve our cash flows 
we have adopted guidelines covering hedging for our natural gas and crude oil production 
these guidelines have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
to mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows  we primarily use over the counter swaps and options 
our hedging policy allows up to of our natural gas and of our crude oil production from proven producing reserves to be hedged for a period up to two years in the future 
our hedging strategy is conducted from an enterprise wide risk perspective  accordingly  we might not externally hedge a portion of our natural gas production when we have offsetting price risk for the fuel requirements of certain of our power generating activities 
the company has entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its estimated and natural gas and crude oil production 
the hedge agreements in place are as follows natural gas location transaction date hedge type term volume price mmbtu day san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap cig swap san juan el paso swap cig swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap nwr swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap aeco swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap cig swap cig swap cig swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap crude oil location transaction date hedge type term volume price bbls month nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex put nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex put nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex put nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap the hedge agreements entered into by the company had a fair value of approximately million as of december  power generation a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
these short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to control such risk  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities and purchased power resources exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
financing activities we engage in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our floating rate debt obligations 
at december   we had million of notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  having a maximum term of years 
these swaps have been designated as hedges in accordance with sfas and accordingly their mark to market adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
we also have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million which were entered into for the purpose of hedging interest rate movements that would impact long term financings that were originally expected to occur in the swaps were originally designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas and the mark to market value was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
based on credit market conditions that transpired during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the forecasted long term debt financings were probable of not occurring in the time period originally specified and as a result  the swaps are no longer effective hedges in accordance with sfas and the hedge relationships were de designated 
mark to market adjustments on the swaps are now recorded within the income statement and during the fourth quarter of we recorded a million pre tax unrealized mark to market charge to earnings 
these swaps are ten and twenty year swaps which have amended mandatory early termination dates ranging from september  to december  further details of the swap agreements are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
on december  and  our interest rate swaps and related balances were as follows in thousands weighted pre tax average maximum accumulated fixed terms non non other pre tax interest in current current current current comprehensive income december  notional rate years assets assets liabilities liabilities income loss loss interest rate swaps interest rate swaps december  interest rate swaps interest rate swaps based on december  market interest rates and balances  a loss of approximately million would be realized and reported in pre tax earnings during the next twelve months 
estimated and realized losses will likely change during the next twelve months as market interest rates change 
on july   cheyenne light entered into a million treasury lock to hedge a million first mortgage bond offering which was completed in november the treasury lock cash settled on october   the pricing date of the offering  and resulted in a million payment to the counterparty 
the payment was recorded as a regulatory asset and will be amortized over the life of the related bonds as additional interest expense

credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from non performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty 
we have adopted the bhccp that establishes guidelines  controls  and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within risk tolerances established by the board of directors 
in addition  our executive credit committee  which includes senior executives  meets on a regular basis to review our credit activities and to monitor compliance with the adopted policies 
for our energy marketing  production  and generation activities  we seek to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies  setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength  obtaining netting agreements  and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental guarantees  prepayments  letters of credit  and other security agreements 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions established  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past  or that an investment grade counterparty will not default sometime in the future 
at december   our credit exposure exclusive of retail customers of our regulated utility segments was concentrated primarily with investment grade companies 
approximately of our credit exposure was with investment grade companies 
the remaining credit exposure is with non investment grade or non rated counterparties  of which a portion was supported through letters of credit  prepayments  or parental guarantees 
foreign exchange contracts our natural gas and crude oil marketing subsidiary conducts its business in the united states and canada 
transactions in canada are generally transacted in canadian dollars  which creates exchange rate risk 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to offset earnings volatility from changes in exchange rates between the canadian and united states dollars 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million canadian dollars  respectively 
these contracts had a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively  and have been recorded as derivative assets liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
all forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  were settled by january  new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for information on new accounting standards adopted in or pending adoption
