item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by volatility in the demand for our products  which may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control 
our success depends on the sustained demand for our products 
many factors affect the level of consumer spending on our products  including  among other things  general economic conditions  interest rates  the availability of consumer credit  taxation  the effects of war  terrorism  fuel prices and consumer confidence in future economic conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
economic conditions have recently deteriorated significantly in the united states  and worldwide  and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
because consumer purchases of our products decline during periods of economic downturn  when disposable income is lower  our revenues and earnings have been adversely affected and may continue to be if the global economic downturn continues 
the growth of our greeting card business is critical to future profitability and cash flow 
one of our key business strategies has been to gain profitable market share by revamping our core greeting card business 
although the majority of the expense associated with these efforts has now been incurred  the need to continuously update and refresh our product offerings is an ongoing  evolving process that will continue to impact net sales  earnings and cash flows over future periods 
the actual amount and timing of the expenditures will depend on the success of the strategy and the schedules of our retail partners 
moreover  our long term success will depend in part on how well we implement our strategy to revamp the greeting card business and we cannot assure you that this strategy will either increase our revenue or profitability 
even if we are able to implement  to a significant degree  this strategy  we may experience systemic  cultural and operational challenges that may prevent any significant increase in profitability or that may otherwise negatively influence our cash flow 
in addition  even if our strategy is successful  our profitability may be adversely affected if consumer demand for lower priced  value cards continues to expand  thereby eroding our average selling prices 
our strategy may also have flaws and may not be successful 
for example  we may not be able to anticipate or respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for greeting cards 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to grant significant credits or accept significant returns  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
conversely  shortages of key items could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on a few mass market retail customers for a significant portion of our sales 
a few of our customers are material to our business and operations 
net sales to our five largest customers  which include mass merchandisers and chain drug stores  accounted for approximately  and of total revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
approximately of the north american social expression products segment s revenue in  and was attributable to its top five customers  and approximately of the international social expression products segment s revenue in  and was attributable to its top three customers 
net sales to wal mart stores  inc and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately  and of total revenue in  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that our large customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities that they have in the past 
the loss of sales to one of our large customers could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in extremely competitive markets  and our business  results of operations and financial condition will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively 
we operate in highly competitive industries 
there are an estimated  greeting card publishers in the united states ranging from small family run organizations to major corporations 
in general  however  the greeting card business is extremely concentrated 
we believe that we are one of only two main suppliers offering a full line of social expression products 
our main competitor  hallmark cards  inc  may have substantially greater financial  technical or marketing resources  a greater customer base  stronger name recognition and a lower cost of funds than we do 
that competitor may also have longstanding relationships with certain large customers to which it may offer products that we do not provide  putting us at a competitive disadvantage 
as a result  this competitor as well as other competitors that may be smaller than us  may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements or consumer preferences more quickly  take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of its products  and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in this market or against such competition 
if we are unable to introduce new and innovative products that are attractive to our customers and ultimate consumers  or if we are unable to allocate sufficient resources to effectively market and advertise our products to achieve widespread market acceptance  we may not be able to compete effectively  our sales may be adversely affected  we may be required to take certain financial charges  including goodwill impairments  and our results of operations and financial condition could otherwise be adversely affected 
our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by retail consolidations 
with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation  we are increasingly dependent upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
we may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail customers  such as inventory de stocking  limitations on access to display space  scan based trading and other conditions 
increased consolidations in the retail industry could result in other changes that could damage our business  such as a loss of customers  decreases in volume and less favorable contractual terms 
in addition  as the bargaining strength of our retail customers grows  we may be required to grant greater credits  discounts  allowances and other incentive considerations to these customers 
we may not be able to recover the costs of these incentives if the customer does not purchase a sufficient amount of products during the term of its agreement with us  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
bankruptcy of key customers could give rise to an inability to pay us and increase our exposure to losses from bad debts 
many of our largest customers are mass market retailers 
the mass market retail channel in the us has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors in recent years 
in addition  the retail industry in general has experienced significant declines due to the worldwide downturn in the economy and decreasing consumer demand 
as a result  retailers have experienced liquidity problems and some have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection 
there is a risk that certain of our key customers will not pay us  or that payment may be delayed because of bankruptcy or other factors beyond our control  which could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts and may require us to write off deferred cost assets 
additionally  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if certain of these mass market retailers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy  or significantly reduce the number of stores they operate 
for example  in the united kingdom  the bankruptcy of a major customer and another major customer implementing buying freezes during fiscal contributed to our recording a goodwill impairment with respect to one reporting unit located in the united kingdom within the international social expression products segment 
rapidly changing trends in the children s entertainment market could adversely affect our business 
a portion of our business and results of operations depends upon the appeal of our licensed character properties  which are used to create various toy and entertainment items for children 
consumer preferences  particularly among children  are continuously changing 
the children s entertainment industry experiences significant  sudden and often unpredictable shifts in demand caused by changes in the preferences of children to more on trend entertainment properties 
in recent years  there have been trends towards shorter life cycles for individual youth entertainment products 
our ability to maintain our current market share and increase our market share in the future depends on our ability to satisfy consumer preferences by enhancing existing entertainment properties and developing new entertainment properties 
if we are not able to successfully meet these challenges in a timely and cost effective manner  demand for our collection of entertainment properties could decrease and our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we may incur significant costs developing entertainment properties that may not generate future revenues at the levels that we anticipated  which could in turn create fluctuations in our reported results based on when those costs are expensed and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis 
the social expression industry is a seasonal business  with sales generally being higher in the second half of our fiscal year due to the concentration of major holidays during that period 
consequently  our overall results of operations in the future may fluctuate substantially based on seasonal demand for our products 
such variations in demand could have a material adverse effect on the timing of cash flows and therefore our ability to meet our obligations with respect to our debt and other financial commitments 
seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels  since we usually order and manufacture merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new trends are confirmed by customer orders or consumer purchases 
we must carry significant amounts of inventory  especially before the holiday season selling period 
if we are not successful in selling the inventory during the holiday period  we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices  or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all 
we rely on foreign sources of production and face a variety of risks associated with doing business in foreign markets 
we rely to a significant extent on foreign manufacturers and suppliers for various products we distribute to customers 
in addition  many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources 
we generally do not have long term supply contracts and some of our imports are subject to existing or potential duties  tariffs or quotas 
in addition  a portion of our current operations are conducted and located abroad 
the success of our sales to  and operations in  foreign markets depends on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we sell our products 
we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad  such as political instability  civil unrest and labor shortages  imposition of new legislation and customs regulations relating to imports that may limit the quantity and or increase the cost of goods which may be imported into the united states from countries in a particular region  lack of effective product quality control procedures by foreign manufacturers and suppliers  currency and foreign exchange risks  and potential delays or disruptions in transportation as well as potential border delays or disruptions 
also  new regulatory initiatives may be implemented that have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include antidumping and countervailing duties or other trade related sanctions  which could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries 
additionally  as a large  multinational corporation  we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world  including antitrust and tax requirements  anti boycott regulations  import export customs regulations and other international trade regulations  the usa patriot act and the foreign corrupt practices act 
failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to criminal or monetary liabilities and other sanctions  which could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products and brand 
our trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  patents and all of our other intellectual property rights are important assets 
we rely on copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions and on confidentiality agreements with some employees and others to protect our proprietary rights 
if these rights were infringed or invalidated  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  our activities could infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  who could assert infringement claims against us 
we could face costly litigation if we are forced to defend these claims 
if we are unsuccessful in doing so  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we seek to register our trademarks and file for patents on significant inventions in the united states and elsewhere 
these registrations could be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
in addition  our confidentiality agreements with some employees or others may not provide adequate protection in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary information  or if our proprietary information otherwise becomes known  or is independently developed by competitors 
we may not realize the full benefit of the material we license from third parties if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if sales revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 
an important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to produce products based on various popular brands  character properties  designs and other licensed material owned by third parties 
such license agreements usually require that we pay an advance and or provide a minimum royalty guarantee that may be substantial  and in some cases may be greater than what we will be able to recoup in profits from actual sales  which could result in write offs of such amounts that would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  we may acquire or renew licenses requiring minimum guarantee payments that may result in us paying higher effective royalties if the overall benefit of obtaining the license outweighs the risk of potentially losing  not renewing or otherwise not obtaining a valuable license 
when obtaining a license  we realize there is no guarantee that a particular licensed property will make a successful greeting card or other product in the eye of the ultimate consumer 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that a successful licensed property will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future 
in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain advantageous licenses  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we are subject to a number of restrictive covenants under our borrowing arrangements  which could affect our flexibility to fund ongoing operations  uses of capital and strategic initiatives  and  if we are unable to maintain compliance with such covenants  could lead to significant challenges in meeting our liquidity requirements 
the terms of our borrowing arrangements contain a number of restrictive covenants  including customary operating restrictions that limit our ability to engage in such activities as borrowing and making investments  capital expenditures and distributions on our capital stock  and engaging in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales 
we are also subject to customary financial covenants  including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
these covenants restrict the amount of our borrowings  reducing our flexibility to fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives 
these borrowing arrangements are described in more detail in liquidity and capital resources under item and in note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k 
compliance with some of these covenants is based on financial measures derived from our operating results 
if economic conditions deteriorate  we may experience material adverse impacts to our business and operating results  such as through reduced customer demand 
a decline in our business could make us unable to maintain compliance with these financial covenants  in which case  we may be restricted in how we fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives and deploy capital  including by limiting our ability to make acquisitions and dispositions  pay dividends and repurchase our stock 
in addition  if we our unable to maintain compliance with our financial covenants or otherwise breach the covenants that we are subject to under our borrowing arrangements  our lenders could demand immediate payment of amounts outstanding and we would need to seek alternate financing sources to pay off such debts and to fund our ongoing operations 
such financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  our credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets  including the stock of certain of our subsidiaries 
if we cannot repay all amounts that we have borrowed under our credit agreement  our lenders could proceed against our assets 
difficulties in integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business and we may not achieve the cost savings and increased revenues anticipated as a result of these acquisitions 
we recently acquired two photo sharing and personal publishing businesses  the greeting card company recycled paper greetings  and the papyrus brand and associated wholesale division of schurman fine papers schurman  which supplies papyrus brand greetings cards primarily to leading specialty  mass  grocery and drug store channels 
in addition  we continue to regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities to support and strengthen our business 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates  acquire candidates on acceptable terms or integrate acquired businesses successfully 
future acquisitions could cause us to take on additional compliance obligations as well as incur debt  dilution  contingent liabilities  increased interest expense  restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets  which may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
integrating our recent acquisitions  as well as future businesses that we may acquire  involves significant challenges 
in particular  the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration 
the integration of these acquired businesses will also require the dedication of significant management resources  which may temporarily distract management s attention from our day to day operations 
the process of integrating operations may also cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of our businesses and the loss of key personnel 
employee uncertainty and distraction during the integration process may also disrupt our business 
our strategy is  in part  predicated on our ability to realize cost savings and to increase revenues through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of our products and services 
achieving these cost savings and revenue increases is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in particular  we may not be able to realize the benefits of anticipated integration of sales forces  asset rationalization  systems integration  and more comprehensive product and service offerings 
if schurman fine papers is unable to operate its retail stores successfully  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
on april   we sold our retail operations segment  including all of our card and gift retail store assets  to schurman  which will operate stores under the american greetings  carlton cards and papyrus brands 
the failure of schurman to operate the retail stores successfully could have a material adverse effect on us  our reputation and our brands  and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations  because  under the terms of the transaction  we will remain subject to certain of the retail operations store leases on a contingent basis through our subleasing of stores to schurman 
we are also the predominant supplier of greeting cards and other social expression products to the retail stores  and we have provided credit support to schurman  including up to million of guarantees in favor of the lenders under schurman s senior revolving credit facility as described in our current report on form k  dated april  in addition  although we do not control schurman  because schurman is licensing the papyrus  american greetings and carlton cards names for the retail stores  actions taken by schurman may be seen by the public as actions taken by us  which  in turn  could adversely affect our reputation or brands 
we may be unsuccessful in increasing revenues or generating a profit from the recent acquisitions of photoworks and webshots in the digital services markets  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our recent acquisitions of two photo sharing and personal publishing businesses are designed to provide us with an entry into the online photo sharing space  a significant number of unique visitors and a platform to provide consumers the ability to use their own photos to create unique  high quality physical products  including greeting cards  calendars  photo albums and photo books 
however  the market for consumer photofinishing and digital imaging services is highly competitive and still emerging 
the major competitors in our market are kodak  snapfish and shutterfly 
in addition to these major competitors  there are numerous other companies that offer online photofinishing services 
even if we establish a strong position among consumers for digital products and services  we may not be able to generate significant revenues or a profit from this market 
the photography industry is also currently characterized by rapidly evolving technology and consumer demand for services and products 
the introduction of digital services and products that use new technologies could render existing services and products obsolete 
our future success in this market will depend on our ability to adapt to new technologies and develop new or modify existing services  products and marketing techniques to satisfy changing consumer needs and attract new customers 
we may be unsuccessful in completing the divestiture of the strawberry shortcake and care bears properties 
we have entered into agreements to sell our strawberry shortcake and care bears properties for net proceeds to us of approximately million 
if this transaction fails to close  it could limit some of our financial flexibility due to the absence of additional liquidity that would have been available from the proceeds of the transaction 
for information regarding the proposed divestiture of these properties  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item increases in raw material and energy costs may materially raise our cost of goods sold and materially impact our profitability 
paper is a significant expense in the production of our greeting cards 
significant increases in paper prices  which have been volatile in past years  or increased costs of other raw materials or energy  such as fuel  may result in declining margins and operating results if market conditions prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases on our greeting cards and other social expression products 
the loss of key members of our senior management and creative teams could adversely affect our business 
our success and continued growth depend largely on the efforts and abilities of our current senior management team as well as upon a number of key members of our creative staff  who have been instrumental in our success thus far  and upon our ability to attract and retain other highly capable and creative individuals 
the loss of some of our senior executives or key members of our creative staff  or an inability to attract or retain other key individuals  could materially and adversely affect us 
we seek to compensate our key executives  as well as other employees  through competitive salaries  stock ownership  bonus plans  or other incentives  but we can make no assurance that these programs will enable us to retain key employees or hire new employees 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time  or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions  which represent a significant number of our employees 
in particular  approximately  of our employees are unionized and are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory  no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements  if disputes with our unions arise  or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work related stoppage  we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
various environmental regulations and risks applicable to a manufacturer and or distributor of consumer products may require us to take actions  which will adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to numerous federal  state  provincial  local and foreign laws and regulations  including regulations with respect to chemical usage  air emissions  wastewater and storm water discharges and other releases into the environment as well as the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials  including hazardous materials 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  because legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements  which may be significant  or the effect on our operations as these laws and regulations may give rise to claims  uncertainties or possible loss contingencies for future environmental remediation liabilities and costs 
we cannot be certain that existing laws or regulations  as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future  or future laws or regulations  will not have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the impact of environmental laws and regulations  regulatory enforcement activities  the discovery of unknown conditions  and third party claims for damages to the environment  real property or persons could result in additional liabilities and costs in the future 
we may be subject to product liability claims and our products could be subject to voluntary or involuntary recalls and other actions 
we are subject to numerous federal and state regulations governing product safety including  but not limited to  those regulations enforced by the consumer product safety commission 
a failure to comply with such regulations  or concerns about product safety  may lead to a recall of selected products 
we have experienced  and in the future may experience  recalls and defects or errors in products after their production and sale to customers 
such recalls and defects or errors could result in the rejection of our products by our retail customers and consumers  damage to our reputation  lost sales  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs  any of which could harm our business 
individuals could sustain injuries from our products  and we may be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting from such injuries 
governmental agencies could pursue us and issue civil fines and or criminal penalties for a failure to comply with product safety regulations 
there is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed  or fall outside the scope of  our insurance coverage 
additionally  we may be unable to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future 
recalls  post manufacture repairs of our products  product liability claims  absence or cost of insurance and administrative costs associated with recalls could harm our reputation  increase costs or reduce sales 
information technology infrastructure failures could significantly affect our business 
we depend heavily on our information technology it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives 
if we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure  such as a computer virus  a problem with the functioning of an important it application  or an intentional disruption of our it systems  the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders  manufacture and ship in a timely manner  or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course 
any such event could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns 
we are refreshing our it systems in stages in an effort to redesign and deploy new processes  organization structures and a common information system over a period of seven to ten years 
such an implementation carries substantial operations risk  including loss of data or information  unanticipated increases in costs  disruption of operations or business interruption 
further  we may not be successful implementing new systems or any new system may not perform as expected 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business 
acts of nature could result in an increase in the cost of raw materials  other catastrophic events  including earthquakes  could interrupt critical functions and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations 
acts of nature could result in an increase in the cost of raw materials or a shortage of raw materials  which could influence the cost of goods supplied to us 
additionally  we have significant operations  including our largest manufacturing facility  near a major earthquake fault line in arkansas 
a catastrophic event  such as an earthquake  fire  tornado  or other natural or man made disaster  could disrupt our operations and impair production or distribution of our products  damage inventory  interrupt critical functions or otherwise affect our business negatively  harming our results of operations 
members of the weiss family and related entities  whose interests may differ from those of other shareholders  own a substantial portion of our common shares 
our authorized capital stock consists of class a common shares and class b common shares 
the economic rights of each class of common shares are identical  but the voting rights differ 
class a common shares are entitled to one vote per share and class b common shares are entitled to ten votes per share 
there is no public trading market for the class b common shares  which are held by members of the extended family of american greetings founder  officers and directors of american greetings and their extended family members  family trusts  institutional investors and certain other persons 
as of april   morry weiss  the chairman of the board of directors  zev weiss  the chief executive officer  jeffrey weiss  the president and chief operating officer  and erwin weiss  the senior vice president  enterprise resource planning  together with other members of the weiss family and certain trusts and foundations established by the weiss family beneficially owned approximately in the aggregate of our outstanding class b common shares approximately  excluding stock options that are presently exercisable or exercisable within days of april   which  together with class a common shares beneficially owned by them  represents approximately of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock approximately  excluding stock options that are presently exercisable or exercisable within days of april  
accordingly  these members of the weiss family  together with the trusts and foundations established by them  would be able to significantly influence the outcome of shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation or code of regulations  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions  and their interests may not be aligned with your interests 
the existence of these levels of ownership concentrated in a few persons makes it less likely that any other shareholder will be able to affect our management or strategic direction 
these factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or voting control or our acquisition by a third party 
our charter documents and ohio law may inhibit a takeover  which could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
certain provisions of ohio law and our charter documents  together or separately  could have the effect of making it more difficult or discouraging for a third party to acquire or attempt to acquire control of american greetings and limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common shares 
for example  our charter documents establish a classified board of directors  serving staggered three year terms  allow the removal of directors only for cause  and establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders meetings 
in addition  while shareholders do have the right to cumulative voting in the election of directors  class b common shares have ten votes per share

as of february   the retail operations segment owned and operated card and gift retail stores throughout north america 
our international operations include wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom uk  canada  australia  new zealand and mexico  as well as licensees in approximately other countries 
we experienced difficult industry conditions during as the global economic slowdown increased in severity throughout the course of the year  particularly during the second half of the year  which is critical to the social expressions industry due to the concentration of major holidays during that period 
these industry conditions were characterized by lower customer traffic in retail stores  less consumer spending due to economic uncertainties and a number of retailer bankruptcies 
these circumstances significantly impacted our results during  leading to lower revenues and earnings throughout the corporation 
in addition  these conditions led to several significant asset impairments during the second half of due to declining results  uncertainties regarding future forecasts and our declining stock price  we recorded goodwill  intangible asset and fixed asset impairments totaling approximately million during these difficult times also provided opportunities that we have leveraged to position ourselves for future success 
our pursuit of these opportunities have led to the following business transactions february  acquisition of recycled paper greetings  april  acquisition of the papyrus trademark and wholesale business division of schurman fine papers that supplies papyrus brand greeting cards to specialty  mass  grocery and drug store channels  and april  divestiture of our retail operations segment 
these actions continue the strategy of focusing on growing our core greeting card business and divesting non core businesses 
the additions of rpg and papyrus provide us with an opportunity for new innovations and ideas 
these acquisitions align with our corporate strategy to grow our business by building on our core competency of greeting cards 
rpg has a history of creating humorous and alternative greeting cards with a unique style and tone to meet consumers needs 
the papyrus brand provides the opportunity to serve a consumer with distinct tastes  one that appreciates the papyrus approach to design and quality 
these acquisitions allow us to focus our efforts and stay true to our vision of providing relevant and compelling products to consumers 
in addition to the above transactions  in march  we came to an agreement with a potential buyer for our strawberry shortcake and care bears properties 
we expect to receive approximately million for our rights in the properties 
the tight credit markets have created difficulty in completing this transaction 
there are still hurdles to finalizing the transaction  but we are moving forward with the goal of closing the transaction during fiscal looking forward to fiscal  we expect the economy to remain challenging at least through the first half of the year 
while we hope to see improvement later in the year  our strategy is to remain conservative until that time 
we have taken actions to reduce costs  including significant headcount reductions during the recent fourth quarter  and are taking further actions to lower manufacturing costs  improve the efficiency of our supply chain and eliminate non essential discretionary spending 
over the past several years we have incurred significant costs associated with our investment in cards strategy  which focused on improving the design  production  display and promotion of our cards  creating relevant and on trend products  brought to market quickly and merchandised in a manner that enhances the shopping experience 
that strategy  combined with the acquisitions  divestiture and cost savings programs described above  positions us to both withstand the current economic conditions and to be well positioned when the economy begins to improve 
we expect the divestiture of our retail stores  net of the acquisitions of rpg and the papyrus wholesale business  to negatively impact fiscal revenues approximately 
we also expect that earnings will be negatively impacted in fiscal due to the transaction and transition expenses we will incur during the period relating to these transactions 
additionally  other revenue  primarily royalty revenue  may be lower in fiscal based on the anticipated sale of the strawberry shortcake and care bears properties 
we recognized a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in  on total revenue of billion in compared to billion in the lower consolidated revenues were significantly impacted by unfavorable foreign currency movements  which accounted for approximately half of the total revenue decline 
in addition  revenues were lower in all segments except the ag interactive segment and our non reportable segments which include the fixtures and licensing businesses 
the increased revenue in the ag interactive segment was primarily due to the digital photography acquisitions completed during the second half of partially offset by lower advertising revenues 
revenues in the north american social expression products segment declined primarily due to lower sales of gift packaging products  party goods and specialty products  partially offset by the favorable impact of fewer sbt implementations compared to the prior year 
revenues were lower within the international social expression products segment due to our uk business that was significantly impacted by the general economic downturn  with the bankruptcy of one major customer  a buying freeze by another major customer and a general decline in sales to most customers during the fourth quarter 
the retail operations segment revenue decreased due to both fewer stores and the decrease in same store sales  particularly during the fourth quarter 
in addition to the million of impairments discussed above  earnings declined due to decreased revenue  an unfavorable product mix and continued increases in product content costs due to the growth in the sale of technology cards and changes in product design that add creative embellishments to the card lines 
these increases in content costs along with the growth in value card sales put downward pressure on our gross margins 
supply chain  scrap and distribution costs were higher than the prior year as increases in card shipments outpaced increases of card unit sales 
results of operations comparison of the years ended february  and february  in  net loss was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in our results for and are summarized below dollars in thousands total revenue total revenue net sales other revenue total revenue material  labor and other production costs selling  distribution and marketing expenses administrative and general expenses goodwill and other intangible assets impairment other operating income net operating loss income interest expense interest income other non operating expense income net loss income from continuing operations before income tax benefit expense income tax benefit expense loss income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net loss income revenue overview consolidated net sales in were billion  a decrease of million from the prior year 
approximately half  or million  of the decrease is attributable to unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts 
the remaining decrease was the result of lower sales in our north american social expression products segment  retail operations segment and international social expression products segment partially offset by increases in our ag interactive segment of approximately million and the non reportable segments of approximately million 
the increased revenue in the ag interactive segment was primarily due to the digital photography acquisitions completed during the second half of partially offset by lower advertising revenues 
net sales of our north american social expression products segment decreased approximately million 
the majority of the decrease is attributable to decreased sales of our gift packaging and party goods product lines of approximately million and million  respectively 
also contributing to the decrease was a decline in specialty product sales  which include stationery  calendars and stickers  of approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of fewer sbt implementations in the current year and the favorable impact of an sbt implementation completed during the year that had previously been estimated  which together increased net sales by approximately million in the current year compared to the retail operations segment s net sales decreased approximately million due to the both the decrease in same store sales of and the reduction in stores 
net sales of our international social expression products segment decreased approximately million 
the decrease in the current year is primarily attributable to reduced sales in the uk due to the recent bankruptcy of a major customer  a buying freeze implemented by another major customer  including on our everyday products  and a general decline in seasonal and everyday card sales to most customers during the fourth quarter 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of approximately million from the uk acquisition completed during the first quarter of this year 
the contribution of each major product category as a percentage of net sales for the past two fiscal years was as follows everyday greeting cards seasonal greeting cards gift packaging all other products the all other products classification includes  among other things  giftware  party goods  calendars  custom display fixtures  stickers  online greeting cards and other digital products 
other revenue  primarily royalty revenue from our strawberry shortcake and care bears properties  decreased million from million in to million in we have entered into an agreement to sell our strawberry shortcake and care bears properties

however  net of prior year sbt implementations that reduced unit volume  everyday card unit volume was essentially flat compared to the prior year 
overall unit volume had been strong through the first three quarters of the year  up  but dropped significantly during the fourth quarter due to the general economic downturn and reduced inventory at retail 
selling prices were down compared to the prior year as a result of the continued trend toward a higher mix of value line cards 
the increased volume of value priced card sales is driven by expanded distribution and changes in consumer preferences 
this growth in the value priced cards more than offsets the impact of the growth in higher priced technology cards 
seasonal card unit volume increased compared to the prior year  driven by improvement in most seasonal programs 
lower selling prices of related to a higher mix of value priced cards across most seasonal programs compared to the prior year

the unfavorable spending variances are primarily attributable to higher scrap and shrink million and increased expenses million associated with our production of film based entertainment  which is used to support our merchandise licensing strategies by increasing the awareness of our properties within the target audience 
costs million associated with the conversion to our new canadian line of cards and increased severance expenses million in the current year also contributed to the unfavorable variances 
the unfavorable mix is due to a shift toward cards with more content  including music  lights and other embellishments 
selling  distribution and marketing expenses were million in  decreasing from million in the prior year 
the decrease of million is due primarily to the impact of favorable foreign currency translation million partially offset by increased spending million 
the increased spending is the result of higher supply chain costs  specifically merchandiser and distribution costs million due to an increase in units shipped

the lower spending is primarily the result of decreased variable compensation expenses million including management bonuses and profit sharing contributions 
the current year results did not meet the operating results required to make these variable compensation payments 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense million partially due to the recent bankruptcy of a major customer in the uk  increased amortization of intangible assets million due to the acquisitions in both and and increased business taxes million due primarily to revised assessment values for certain personal property 
goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of million were recorded in in the third quarter of  indicators emerged during the period that led us to conclude that an impairment test was required prior to the annual test

the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the uk was million  which represents all of the goodwill for this reporting unit 
the goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge for the ag interactive segment was million  which includes all of the goodwill for ag interactive 
an additional impairment analysis was performed at the end of the fourth quarter of as a result of the continued significant deterioration of the global economic environment and the decline in the price of our common shares 
based on that analysis  we recorded goodwill charges of million  which includes all the goodwill for our north american greeting card division nagcd and million  which includes all the goodwill for our fixtures business 
nagcd is part of our north american social expression products segment and the fixtures business is included in non reportable segments 
also  in the fourth quarter  the estimated ag interactive goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter was finalized which resulted in a credit of million being recorded due to final purchase accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in the increase of million is primarily attributable to increased borrowings on our revolving credit facility million and the accounts receivable securitization facility million in the current period 
these increases were partially offset by interest savings million associated with the reduced balance outstanding of our notes as well as reduced fees for our credit and accounts receivable facilities 
the reduction in commitment fees is primarily due to increased borrowings under the facilities 
other non operating expense income net was expense of million in compared to income of million in the decrease of million is due to a swing of approximately million from a foreign exchange gain in to a loss in and to the loss of approximately million on our investment in debt securities

segment earnings  excluding the impact of foreign exchange and intersegment items  increased million  or  in compared to the prior year 
approximately million of the increase was due to lower spending on our investment in cards strategy and sbt conversions 
segment earnings were impacted by a favorable product mix due to a change to a richer mix of card versus non card products  driven by improved everyday and seasonal card sales and decreased sales of non card products  primarily as a result of the sale of our candle product lines in january and lower sales of gift packaging products 
these improvements were partially offset by increases in card product costs associated with more technology cards paper cards that include lights and or sound  increased sbt scrap  higher creative content costs and the impact on earnings of the decrease in total revenue 
segment earnings in benefited from the gain related to terminations of long term supply agreements associated with retailer consolidations million  but was unfavorably impacted by the loss incurred on the sale of the candle product lines million 
international social expression products segment dollars in thousands change total revenue segment earnings total revenue of the international social expression products segment  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  increased million  or  in compared to this increase was driven by additional distribution obtained during the year  primarily in the uk segment earnings  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  increased million compared to this increase is attributable to improvements in our uk operations  including expanded distribution  changes in product mix and cost savings initiatives in manufacturing and supply chain 
also  the prior year earnings included severance charges million primarily as a result of facility closures  including the manufacturing facility in australia 
retail operations segment dollars in thousands change total revenue segment loss the retail operations segment exhibits considerable seasonality  which is typical for most retail store operations 
a significant amount of the total revenue and segment earnings occur during the fourth quarter in conjunction with the major holiday seasons 
total revenue in our retail operations segment  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  decreased million  or  year over year 
total revenue at stores open one year or more was up approximately  or approximately million  from but was more than offset by the reduction in store doors 
the average number of stores decreased approximately compared to the prior year  which reduced revenues by approximately million 
the current year benefited from the performance of children s gifting products  which was the driver of the same store sales increase 
segment loss  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  was million in compared to million in approximately half of the million improvement in earnings is due to the prior year charges associated with the closure of underperforming stores during the fourth quarter 
the remaining improvement is attributable to lower store and administrative expenses due to fewer doors as well as improved product mix 
gross margins increased by approximately percentage points  partially due to less promotional pricing compared to the prior year 
ag interactive segment dollars in thousands change total revenue segment earnings total revenue  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  decreased million  or  from this decrease is the result of the lower revenue in the mobile product group million due to reduced offerings in partially offset by advertising and subscription revenue growth in the online product group million and digital photography revenue million in the current year associated with the two acquisitions made in the second half of the year 
at the end of  ag interactive had approximately million paid subscriptions versus million in segment earnings  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  increased million in compared to growth in advertising and subscription revenue as well as lower expenses in the mobile product group due to the reduced offerings in that group were substantially offset by expenses incurred in the current year associated with the two digital photography acquisitions in the second half of the year

liquidity and capital resources operating activities during the year  cash flow from operating activities provided cash of million compared to million in  a decrease of million 
cash flow from operating activities for compared to resulted in a decrease of million from million in other non cash charges were million during compared to million during the increase is primarily due to an increase of approximately million in the fixed asset impairment charges recorded in the current year compared to the prior year related to our retail operations segment 
other non cash charges in included million for the loss on our investment in debt securities 
this loss was substantially offset by a reduction in stock based compensation expense 
accounts receivable  net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions  was a use of cash of million in compared to a source of cash of million in and million in as a percentage of the prior twelve months net sales  net accounts receivable was at february   compared to at february  the current year use of cash is due to higher accounts receivable balances in the north american social expression products segment as a result of less sbt implementation activity in the fourth quarter of the current year compared to the prior year period 
we generally experience lower sales and accounts receivable balances in the period a customer moves to the sbt business model 
the prior year source of cash was primarily attributable to additional customers moving to the sbt business model during  particularly in the fourth quarter  which as noted above causes a lower accounts receivable balance in the period of implementation as sales are reversed 
in addition  customers on the sbt business model generally tend to have shorter payment terms than non sbt customers 
inventories  net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions  provided a source of cash of million in compared to a use of cash of million in and a source of cash of million in the increase in inventory  thus a use of cash  in from is attributable to the north american social expression products segment  primarily due to the increase in technology cards and the inventory build related to the new canadian product line

during  and  amortization exceeded payments by million  million and million  respectively

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of deferred costs related to customer agreements 
accounts payable and other liabilities  net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions  used million of cash in compared to providing million of cash in and million of cash in the change was attributable primarily to lower year end accruals related to variable compensation and other normal course of business accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and income and other taxes payable 
for example  variable compensation payable and income taxes payable were lower at february  than at february  due to our poor financial results in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in accounts payable and other liabilities in was attributable to accrued compensation and benefits and income taxes payable 
the change in accounts payable and other liabilities in was primarily due to a reduction in trade payables and the profit sharing accrual partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable

on may   we issued million of senior unsecured notes  due on june  the proceeds from this issuance were used for the repurchase of our senior notes due on august  that were tendered in the tender offer and consent solicitation that was completed on may  on february   we issued million of additional senior unsecured notes described above additional senior notes and million of new unsecured notes due on june  new notes in conjunction with the acquisition of rpg 
the original issue discount from the issuance of these notes of million was recorded as a reduction of the underlying debt issuances and is being amortized over the life of the debt using the effective interest method 
including the original issue discount  the new notes and the additional senior notes have an effective annualized interest rate of approximately 
except as described below  the terms of the new notes and the additional senior notes are the same 
the new notes and the additional senior notes will mature on june  and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  commencing june  the new notes and the additional senior notes constitute general  unsecured obligations of the corporation 
the new notes and the additional senior notes rank equally with our other senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our obligations that are  by their terms  expressly subordinated in right of payment to the new notes or the additional senior notes  as applicable 
the additional senior notes are effectively subordinated to all of our secured indebtedness  including borrowings under our credit agreement  to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
the new notes are contractually subordinated to amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  and are effectively subordinated to any other secured indebtedness that we may issue from time to time to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness

the total fair value of our publicly traded debt  based on quoted market prices  was million at a carrying value of million at february  the carrying amount of our publicly traded debt significantly exceeded its fair value at february  due to the tighter us credit markets 
throughout fiscal  we will continue to consider all options for capital deployment including growth options  capital expenditures  the opportunity to repurchase our own shares  or by reducing debt 
to this end  in january  we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of class a common shares  that may be made through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant  at prices the company deems appropriate  and subject to applicable legal requirements and other factors 
there is no set expiration date for this program 
we also may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise  including strategically repurchasing our senior unsecured notes due in at a discount to par 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
our future operating cash flow and borrowing availability under our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization facility are expected to meet currently anticipated funding requirements 
the seasonal nature of the business results in peak working capital requirements that may be financed through short term borrowings 
contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of february  payment due by period as of february  in thousands thereafter total long term debt operating leases commitments under customer agreements commitments under royalty agreements interest payments severance the interest payments in the above table are determined assuming the same level of debt outstanding in the future years as at february  for the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility at the current average interest rates for those facilities 
in addition to the contracts noted in the table  we issue purchase orders for products  materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of business 
these purchase orders typically do not include long term volume commitments  are based on pricing terms previously negotiated with vendors and are generally cancelable with the appropriate notice prior to receipt of the materials or supplies 
accordingly  the foregoing table excludes open purchase orders for such products  materials and supplies as of february  although we do not anticipate that contributions will be required in to the defined benefit pension plan that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of gibson greetings  inc in  we may make contributions in excess of the legally required minimum contribution level 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
we do anticipate that contributions will be required beginning in fiscal  but those amounts have not been determined as of february  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of the critical areas that required a higher degree of judgment or are considered complex 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably expect will be collected 
in addition  we recognize allowances for bad debts based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs 
the establishment of allowances requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although we consider these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in the retail markets in which we operate could have a material effect on the required allowance balances 
sales returns we provide for estimated returns for products sold with the right of return  primarily seasonal cards  certain other seasonal products and everyday cards at certain foreign locations  in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical sales returns  the amount of current year sales and other known factors 
estimated return rates utilized for establishing estimated returns reserves have approximated actual returns experience 
however  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from these estimates if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and or its market 
we regularly monitor our actual performance to estimated rates and the adjustments attributable to any changes have historically not been material 
deferred costs in the normal course of our business  we enter into agreements with certain customers for the supply of greeting cards and related products 
we view such agreements as advantageous in developing and maintaining business with our retail customers 
the customer typically receives a combination of cash payments  credits  discounts  allowances and other incentive considerations to be earned as product is purchased from us over the stated term of the agreement or the effective time period of the agreement to meet a minimum purchase volume commitment 
these agreements are negotiated individually to meet competitive situations and therefore  while some aspects of the agreements may be similar  important contractual terms may vary 
in addition  the agreements may or may not specify us as the sole supplier of social expression products to the customer 
although risk is inherent in the granting of advances  we subject such customers to our normal credit review 
we maintain a general allowance for deferred costs based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs 
in instances where we are aware of a particular customer s inability to meet its performance obligation  we record a specific allowance to reduce the deferred cost asset to an estimate of its future value based upon expected recoverability 
losses attributed to these specific events have historically not been material 
for those contractual arrangements that are based upon a minimum purchase volume commitment  we periodically review the progress toward the volume commitment and estimate future sales expectations for each customer 
factors that can affect our estimate include store door openings and closings  retail industry consolidation  amendments to the agreements  consumer shopping trends  addition or deletion of participating products and product productivity 
based upon our review  we may modify the remaining amortization periods of individual agreements to reflect the changes in the estimates for the attainment of the minimum volume commitment in order to align amortization expense with the periods benefited 
we do not make retroactive expense adjustments to prior fiscal years as amounts  if any  have historically not been material 
the aggregate average remaining life of our contract base is years 
the accuracy of our assessments of the performance related value of a deferred cost asset related to a particular agreement and of the estimated time period of the completion of a volume commitment is based upon our ability to accurately predict certain key variables such as product demand at retail  product pricing  customer viability and other economic factors 
predicting these key variables involves uncertainty about future events  however  the assumptions used are consistent with our internal planning 
if the deferred cost assets are assessed to be recoverable  they are amortized over the periods benefited 
if the carrying value of these assets is considered to not be recoverable through performance  such assets are written down as appropriate 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and certain intangible assets are presumed to have indefinite useful lives and are thus not amortized  but subject to an impairment test annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
we complete the annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter 
to test for goodwill impairment  we are required to estimate the fair market value of each of our reporting units 
while we may use a variety of methods to estimate fair value for impairment testing  our primary methods are discounted cash flows and a market based analysis 
we estimate future cash flows and allocations of certain assets using estimates for future growth rates and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates 
changes to our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair market value of the reporting units  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we assess whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
the assumptions used in this assessment are consistent with our internal planning 
a valuation allowance is recorded against those deferred tax assets determined to not be realizable based on our assessment 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or decreased in the future if our assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies change

the adoption of fsp r in fiscal will have no effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results certain statements in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts 
they use such words as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available information  but are subject to a variety of uncertainties  unknown risks and other factors concerning our operations and business environment  which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward looking statements  and that could adversely affect our future financial performance  include  but are not limited to  the following a weak retail environment and general economic conditions  the ability to successfully integrate acquisitions  including the recent acquisitions of rpg and the papyrus brand  our ability to successfully complete the proposed sale of the strawberry shortcake and care bears properties  our successful transition of the retail operations segment to its buyer  schurman fine papers  and the ability to achieve the desired benefits associated with this and other dispositions  retail consolidations  acquisitions and bankruptcies  including the possibility of resulting adverse changes to retail contract terms  the ability to achieve the desired benefits associated with our cost reduction efforts  competitive terms of sale offered to customers  the ability to comply with our debt covenants  the timing and impact of investments in new retail or product strategies as well as new product introductions and achieving the desired benefits from those investments  consumer acceptance of products as priced and marketed  the impact of technology on core product sales  the timing and impact of converting customers to a scan based trading model  the escalation in the cost of providing employee health care  the ability to successfully implement  or achieve the desired benefits associated with  any information systems refresh that we may implement  the ability to achieve the desired accretive effect from any share repurchase programs  fluctuations in the value of currencies in major areas where we operate  including the us dollar  euro  us pound sterling and canadian dollar  and the outcome of any legal claims known or unknown 
risks pertaining specifically to ag interactive include the viability of online advertising  subscriptions as revenue generators  the public s acceptance of online greetings and other social expression products  and the ability to gain a leadership position in the digital photo sharing space 
the risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us 
should any known or unknown risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for further information concerning the risks we face and issues that could materially affect our financial performance related to forward looking statements  refer to the risk factors section included in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments during  we entered into an interest rate derivative designed to offset the interest rate risk related to the forecasted issuance of million of senior indebtedness 
the interest rate derivative agreement expired during the year 
we did not designate this agreement as a hedging instrument pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  the change in fair value of this agreement was recognized and included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended february  we have no derivative financial instruments as of february  interest rate exposure we manage interest rate exposure through a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
currently  the majority of our debt is carried at fixed interest rates 
therefore  our overall interest rate exposure risk is minimal 
based on our interest rate exposure on our non fixed rate debt as of and during the year ended february   a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have had a material impact on interest expense 
under the terms of our current credit agreement  we have the ability to borrow significantly more floating rate debt  which  if incurred could have a material impact on interest expense in a fluctuating interest rate environment 
foreign currency exposure our international operations expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated into us dollars 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of operations of international subsidiaries to us dollars could affect comparability of results between years 
approximately  and of our  and total revenue from continuing operations  respectively  were generated from operations outside the united states 
operations in australasia  canada  mexico  the european union and the uk are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
no assurance can be given that future results will not be affected by significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates
