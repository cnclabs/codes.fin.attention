item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
government regulation regarding the environment as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations  our businesses are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws  as well as other legal requirements relating to the generation  storage  transport and disposal of materials 
these laws include  without limitation  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the comprehensive environmental response and compensation and liability act 
we currently do not anticipate any materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of our compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our manufacturing operations and there is no assurance that material liabilities or charges could not arise 
during the year ended december   we capitalized approximately million related to environmental and safety control facilities and we also incurred and expensed an additional million related to environmental and safety control facilities 
we also expect to capitalize million related to environmental and safety control facilities during the year ending december  and also expect to incur and expense charges of approximately million related to environmental and safety control facilities during the year ending december  
table of contents item a 
risk factors certain risk factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material to our stockholders 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential  or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of the following risks occur our leslie controls  inc subsidiary is subject to asbestos related litigation that could ultimately have an adverse effect on our financial statements  results of operations or cash flows 
as more fully described in part i  item legal proceedings  our leslie subsidiary has been and continues to be named as a defendant in asbestos related product liability actions 
the actual amounts expended on asbestos related claims in any year may be impacted by the number of claims filed  the volume of pre trial proceedings  and the numbers of trials and settlements 
as of december   leslie has a liability of million and anticipated insurance recoveries of million  for the estimated indemnity cost associated with resolution of its current open claims 
although leslie believes this estimate is reasonable  such estimate also is highly uncertain  especially because leslie s claims history is relatively limited  very recent  and quite variable 
as a result  the actual costs of resolving these pending claims could be substantially higher or lower than the current estimate 
in addition  while future claims are probable  leslie s management cannot estimate the losses that may arise from such future claims and we  therefore  have not accrued a liability for such future claims 
moreover  because we have factored the full amount of our remaining primary layer insurance limits into our accruals for the indemnity cost of resolving current open claims  and because leslie has only limited available excess layer coverage  leslie will be responsible for a substantial majority of indemnity costs associated with future claims 
leslie also incurs significant costs in defending asbestos claims and we record these costs at the time incurred 
because leslie has remaining primary layer coverage on an actual cash disbursement basis as distinguished from our accruals  primary layer insurers currently pay of such defense costs 
we believe the amount of remaining primary layer coverage is million 
while we cannot reasonably predict when this primary layer will be fully exhausted  if leslie s rate of settlements were to continue at a pace consistent with the past two years  and  assuming no payments on account of any adverse verdicts  policy limits would be reached within approximately two to three years 
if however  leslie were to be required to make payments on account of any adverse verdicts  the time period within which such policy limits would be reached could be significantly shorter 
because leslie has only limited available excess layer coverage  leslie would become responsible for a substantial majority of its defense costs upon exhaustion of the primary layer of insurance 
in addition to exhaustion of the primary layer of insurance  a significant increase beyond our estimates in the cost to leslie of resolving current claims  the incurrence of significant liability with respect to future claims  or a significant increase in the cost of defending current and future asbestos claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we  therefore  refer the reader to and incorporate by reference part i  item captioned legal proceedings in this 
table of contents annual report on form k and to part i  item i captioned legal proceedings in our periodic filings on form q which provides more specific information regarding leslie s asbestos litigation and insurance situation 
we believe that payment of any litigation related asbestos liabilities of leslie leslie currently constitutes approximately of the company s consolidated revenues and of the company s shareholders equity is legally limited to the net assets of that subsidiary 
this belief is based on the principle of american law that a shareholder including a parent corporation is generally not liable for an incorporated entity s obligations 
some of our end markets are cyclical  which may cause us to experience fluctuations in revenues or operating results 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
we sell our products principally to oil  gas  petrochemical  process  power  aerospace  military  heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac  maritime  pharmaceutical  and medical and instrumentation markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one  a significant downturn in any one of these markets could cause a material reduction in our revenues that could be difficult to offset 
in particular  our petrochemical business is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for oil and gas is depressed  the demand for our products used in maintenance and repair of existing oil and gas applications  as well as exploration or new oil and gas project applications  is reduced 
as a result  we historically have generated lower revenues and profits in periods of declining demand for petrochemical products 
therefore  results of operations for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
future downturns or anticipated downturns in demand for petrochemical products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we  along with our customers and vendors  face the continuing impact of turmoil and uncertainty in the public and private credit markets and in general economic conditions in the united states and around the world 
the public and private capital and credit markets in the united states and around the world continue to experience extreme volatility  disruption and general slowdown at unprecedented levels 
this has spawned an unprecedented deterioration in many industrial markets including several of the markets into which we sell our products 
the breadth  depth and duration of this crisis remains uncertain 
these conditions can adversely affect our revenue  results of operations and overall financial growth 
our business can be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control such as general geopolitical  economic and business conditions and conditions in the financial services market  which each could materially impact our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  capital resources and liquidity 
additionally  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
although we do not currently anticipate a need to access the credit markets for new financing in the short term  a prolonged 
table of contents constriction on future lending by banks or investors could result in higher interest rates on future debt obligations or could restrict our ability to obtain sufficient financing to meet our long term operational and capital needs or could limit our ability in the future to consummate strategic acquisitions 
the current uncertainty and turmoil in the credit markets may also negatively impact the ability of our customers and vendors to finance their operations which  in turn  could result in a decline in our sales and in our ability to obtain necessary raw materials and components  thus potentially having an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a resurgence of terrorist activity around the world could cause economic conditions to deteriorate and adversely impact our businesses 
in the past  terrorist attacks have negatively impacted general economic  market and political conditions 
in particular  the terrorist attacks  compounded with changes in the national economy  resulted in reduced revenues in the aerospace and general industrial markets in years and although economic conditions have improved considerably  additional terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world could cause damage or disruption to our business  our facilities or our employees which could significantly impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility  including the current conflicts in iraq and the middle east  have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  with manufacturing facilities located worldwide  including facilities located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china  we may be impacted by terrorist actions not only against the united states but in other parts of the world as well 
we are not insured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war for our aviation products 
if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities for the production of our products 
the equipment and management systems necessary for such operations may break down  perform poorly  or fail  resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies 
such fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
commencing in and continuing in  we embarked on a company wide program to implement lean manufacturing techniques 
we believe that this process will produce meaningful reductions in manufacturing costs 
however  implementation of these techniques may cause short term inefficiencies in production 
if we ultimately are unable to successfully implement these processes our anticipated profitability may suffer 
we face significant competition in our markets and  if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets  our revenues may decrease 
we face significant competition from a variety of competitors in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do 
new competitors also could enter our markets 
we consider product quality  performance  price  distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in our markets 
our competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing  duplicate our strategies  or 
table of contents develop enhancements to products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products 
competitive pressures  including those described above  and other factors could adversely affect our competitive position  involving a loss of market share or decreases in prices  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products that are priced in other currencies 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance  our revenues may decrease 
our industries are characterized by intense competition  changes in end user requirements  technically complex products  and evolving product offerings and introductions 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands 
failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of qualified engineers  which could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 
implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or could reduce our profitability 
one of our continued strategies is to increase our revenues and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary instrumentation and thermal fluid controls and energy products 
we expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates that may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  there can be no assurance that companies we acquire will achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them and may result in an impairment charge 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  or unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
some or all of these special risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver high quality products  we may lose customers 
product quality and performance are a priority for our customers since many of our product applications involve caustic or volatile chemicals and  in many cases  involve processes that require precise control of fluids 
our products also are used in the aerospace  military  commercial aircraft  pharmaceutical  
table of contents medical  analytical equipment  oil and gas exploration  transmission and refining  chemical processing  and maritime industries 
these industries require products that meet stringent performance and safety standards 
if we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures  our products will not meet these stringent performance and safety standards 
substandard products would seriously harm our reputation  resulting in both a loss of current customers to our competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to continue operating successfully overseas or to successfully expand into new international markets  our revenues may decrease 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states 
in addition  one of our key growth strategies is to market our products in international markets not currently served by us in portions of europe  latin america and asia 
we may not succeed in marketing  selling and distributing our products in these new markets 
moreover  conducting business outside the united states is subject to additional risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in regional  political or economic conditions  trade protection measures such as tariffs or import or export restrictions  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of these factors could prevent us from successfully expanding into new international markets and could also have a material adverse effect on our current international operations 
if we cannot pass on higher raw material or manufacturing costs to our customers  we may become less profitable 
one of the ways we attempt to manage the risk of higher raw material and manufacturing costs is to increase selling prices to our customers 
the markets we serve are extremely competitive and customers may not accept price increases or may look to alternative suppliers which may negatively impact our profitability and revenues 
if our suppliers cannot provide us with adequate quantities of materials to meet our customers demands on a timely basis or if the quality of the materials provided does not meet our standards we may lose customers or experience lower profitability 
some of our customer contracts require us to compensate those customers if we do not meet specified delivery obligations 
we rely on numerous suppliers to provide us with our required materials and in many instances these materials must meet certain specifications 
for example  during and part of  we experienced diminished supplier performance that negatively impacted our operating and net income 
the diminished supplier performance was the result of the closure of certain suppliers  problems with new supplier on time delivery reliability as well as lower than expected new supplier qualification acceptance 
while we believe that we have remediated these lower supplier performance issues and alleviated the diminished impact on profitability  a continuation or recurrence of these factors could have a negative impact on our ability to deliver our products to our customers within our committed time frames and could result in continued reductions of our operating and net income in future periods 

table of contents a change in international governmental policies or restrictions could result in decreased availability and increased costs for certain components and finished products that we outsource  which could adversely affect our profitability 
like most manufacturers of fluid control products  we attempt  where appropriate  to reduce costs by seeking lower cost sources of certain components and finished products 
many such sources are located in developing countries such as the people s republic of china  india and taiwan  where a change in governmental approach toward us trade could restrict the availability to us of such sources 
in addition  periods of war or other international tension could interfere with international freight operations and hinder our ability to take delivery of such components and products 
a decrease in the availability of these items could hinder our ability to timely meet our customers orders 
we attempt  when possible  to mitigate this risk by maintaining alternate sources for these components and products and by maintaining the capability to produce such items in our own manufacturing facilities 
however  even when we are able to mitigate this risk  the cost of obtaining such items from alternate sources or producing them ourselves is often considerably greater  and a shift toward such higher cost production could therefore adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations  and curing any violations of these regulations could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these or existing regulations could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
the costs of complying with existing or future governmental regulations on importing and exporting practices and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses  reduce our revenues or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of laws and international trade practices including regulations issued by the united states bureau of customs and border protection  the bureau of export administration  the department of state  the department of treasury 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could limit the countries into which certain of our products may be sold or could restrict our access to and increase the cost of 
table of contents obtaining products from foreign sources 
in addition  actual or alleged violations of such regulations could result in enforcement actions and or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 
if our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
if either management or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that exist as of the end of our fiscal year  the material weakness es will be reported either by management in its self assessment or by our independent registered public accounting firm in its report or both  which may result in a loss of public confidence and could have an adverse affect on our business and our stock price 
this could also result in significant additional expenditures responding to the section internal control audit and a diversion of management attention 
we face risks from product liability lawsuits that may adversely affect our business 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids and chemicals  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
we generally seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our third party suppliers  and for us to be added as an additional insured party under such parties insurance policies 
any such indemnification or insurance is limited by its terms and  as a practical matter  is limited to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying or insuring party 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  product liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if any of our key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company  some of our customers might choose to use the services of that competitor or those of a new company instead of our own 
other companies seeking to develop capabilities and products similar to ours may hire away some of our key personnel 
if we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new employees  the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited 

table of contents various restrictions and agreements could hinder a takeover of us which is not supported by our board of directors or which is leveraged 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  the delaware general corporation law and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control in a transaction that is not approved by our board of directors or that is on a leveraged basis or otherwise 
these include provisions creating a staggered board  limiting the shareholders powers to remove directors  and prohibiting shareholders from calling a special meeting or taking action by written consent in lieu of a shareholders meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the shareholders  to set the terms of and to issue preferred stock 
issuing preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the owners of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
additionally  we have adopted a shareholder rights plan providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or with respect to passive investors or more of our shares of common stock  unless the rights are redeemed 
delaying or preventing a takeover could result in our shareholders ultimately receiving less for their shares by deterring potential bidders for our stock or assets 
our debt agreements limit our ability to issue equity  make acquisitions  incur debt  pay dividends  make investments  sell assets  merge or raise capital 
our outstanding industrial revenue bond  and our revolving credit facility agreement  dated december  and amended october   govern our indebtedness to our lenders 
the debt agreements include provisions which place limitations on certain activities including our ability to issue shares of our common stock  incur additional indebtedness  create any liens or encumbrances on our assets or make any guarantees  make certain investments  pay cash dividends above certain limits  or dispose of or sell assets or enter into a merger or a similar transaction 
the trading price of our common stock continues to be volatile and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses 
the trading price of our common stock may be  and  in fact  recently has been volatile 
our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to our failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results or buy sell recommendations by securities analysts  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product line developments  contracts or acquisitions or publicity regarding actual or potential results or performance  fluctuation in our quarterly operating results caused by fluctuations in revenue and expenses  substantial sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders  general stock market conditions  or other economic or external factors 
while we attempt in our public disclosures to provide forward looking information in order to enable investors to anticipate our future performance  such information by its nature represents our good faith forecasting efforts 
the unprecedented nature of the recent credit crisis and economic recession  together with the uncertain depth and duration of these crises  has rendered such forecasting more difficult 
as a result  our actual results could differ materially from our forecasts which could cause further volatility in the value of our common stock 

table of contents in addition  the stock market as a whole has recently experienced dramatic price deterioration and volume fluctuations 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
our international activities expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our international manufacturing and sales activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such fluctuations could result in our i paying higher prices for certain imported goods and services  ii realizing lower prices for any sales denominated in currencies other than us dollars  iii realizing lower net income  on a us dollar basis  from our international operations due to the effects of translation from weakened functional currencies  and iv realizing higher costs to settle transactions denominated in other currencies 
any of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in western europe  canada and asia 
we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with maturities of less than eighteen months 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate fluctuations because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we maintain major facilities worldwide  including significant manufacturing operations located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china 
many of these facilities contain sales offices or warehouses from which we ship finished goods to customers  distributors and commissioned representative organizations 
our executive office is located in burlington  massachusetts 
the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products group has facilities located in the united states  germany  france  the netherlands  and the united kingdom 
properties in ronkonkoma  new york  corona  california  dayton  ohio  le plessis  france  and spartanburg  south carolina are leased 
the energy products group has facilities located in the united states  canada  italy and the people s republic of china 
properties in nerviano  italy  naviglio  italy  edmonton  alberta  canada  the distribution center in oklahoma city  oklahoma  and the manufacturing facility in sapulpa  oklahoma are leased 
our tampa  florida facility is subject to a collateral assignment under a loan agreement with a long term lender 
in general  we believe that our properties  including machinery  tools and equipment  are in good condition  are well maintained  and are adequate and suitable for their intended uses 
our manufacturing facilities generally operate five days per week on one or two shifts 
we believe our manufacturing capacity could be increased by working additional shifts and weekends and by successful implementation of our on going lean manufacturing initiatives 

table of contents item legal proceedings asbestos litigation background like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  our subsidiary leslie  which we acquired in  has been and continues to be named as a defendant in product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals who seek compensation for their alleged exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
in some instances  we also have been named individually and or as alleged successor in interest in these cases 
as of the end of fiscal  leslie was a named defendant in approximately active  unresolved asbestos related claims filed in california  texas  new york  massachusetts  west virginia  rhode island and other states 
approximately of these claims involve claimants allegedly suffering from or the estates of decedents who allegedly died from mesothelioma  a fatal malignancy associated with asbestos exposure 
in addition to these claims  leslie remains a named defendant in approximately  unresolved asbestos related claims filed in mississippi 
since  however  the mississippi supreme court has interpreted joinder rules more strictly  and the state legislature enacted a tort reform act under which each plaintiff must independently satisfy venue provisions  thus preventing thousands of out of state claimants from tagging onto a single in state plaintiff s case 
as a result of these changes  mississippi state court judges since have severed and dismissed tens of thousands of out of state asbestos claims against numerous defendants including leslie 
we continue to expect that most of the remaining mississippi claims against leslie will be dismissed as well 
leslie has not incurred any indemnity costs in mississippi and defense costs to resolve these mississippi claims have not been significant 
while it is possible that certain dismissed claims could be re filed in mississippi or in other jurisdictions  any such re filings likely would be made on behalf of one or a small number of related individuals who could demonstrate actual injury and some connection to leslie s products 
leslie s asbestos related claims generally involve its fluid control products 
leslie management believes that any asbestos was incorporated entirely within the product in a way that would not allow for any ambient asbestos during normal operation or during normal inspection and repair procedures 
leslie and its insurers general strategy has been to vigorously defend these claims 
nevertheless  while we strongly believe that exposure to leslie s products has not caused asbestos related illness to any plaintiff  juries or courts could reach a different conclusion in particular cases 
leslie has resolved a number of asbestos related claims over the past few years and continues to do so for strategic reasons  including avoidance of defense costs and the possible risk of excessive verdicts 
the amounts expended on asbestos related claims in any year may be impacted by the number of claims filed  the volume of pre trial proceedings  and the numbers of trials and settlements 
on october   a los angeles state court jury rendered a verdict that  if allowed to stand  would result in a liability to leslie of approximately million 
although leslie accrued a liability in the third quarter of fiscal for this verdict  both leslie and the other defendant against whom the judgment was rendered have appealed this verdict 
we believe there are strong grounds for either significantly reducing the amount of the award or for requiring a new trial 
in addition  leslie has accrued an incremental million liability related to an earlier verdict for which an appeal is pending and there is million in accrued interest for both adverse verdicts 

table of contents accounting indemnity and defense cost liabilities and assets leslie records an estimated liability associated with reported asbestos claims when it believes that a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated 
prior to the fourth quarter of  with respect to its unresolved pending claims  leslie did not believe that it had sufficient information to assess the likelihood of resolving such claims 
accordingly  leslie accrued for defense costs as incurred  and accrued for pending claims only when resolution of a particular claim was probable and the probable loss was estimable 
as a practical matter  the claims accrual generally occurred close in time to when a settlement agreement for a particular claim was reached 
in most cases  settlement payments are paid to claimants within thirty to sixty days of settlement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we engaged hamilton  rabinovitz and associates  inc hr a  a firm specializing in estimating expected liabilities of mass tort claims  to help us determine an estimate of leslie s asbestos related liabilities 
because leslie s claims experience is both limited and variable  hr a concluded that any estimate of pending or future liabilities of leslie s asbestos claims would be highly uncertain from a statistical perspective 
leslie s management determined  however  that  by using its historical albeit limited and variable average cost by disease classification in resolving closed claims  and by applying this information to the mix of current open claims  it could make a reasonable estimate of the indemnity costs to be incurred in resolving such current open claims 
as a result  leslie recorded a liability of million during the fourth quarter of and an additional million during for the estimated indemnity cost associated with resolution of its current open claims 
during the fourth quarter of  hr a updated its analysis and reaffirmed its conclusion that a forecast of the number and value of any future asbestos claims is unwarranted and highly uncertain from a statistical perspective 
as of december   leslie has recorded asbestos liabilities of million million short term and million long term compared to million as of december  the million liability as of december  is comprised of million for existing claims  million related to adverse verdicts and million for incurred but unpaid legal costs 
asbestos related insurance receivable amounts totaled million million short term and million long term as of december  compared to million as of december  the million receivable as of december  is comprised of million for existing claims  million related to adverse verdicts and million for incurred but unpaid legal costs 
a summary of leslie s unpaid existing asbestos claims and incurred asbestos defense cost liabilities and the related insurance recoveries is provided below 
as of december in thousands existing claim indemnity liability incurred defense cost liability insurance recoveries receivable net asbestos liability although leslie believes its estimates are reasonable  such estimates are also highly uncertain  especially because leslie s claims history is relatively limited  recent and quite variable 
depending on future events  
table of contents the actual costs of resolving these pending claims could be substantially higher or lower than the current estimate 
some of the more significant unknown or uncertain factors that will affect these costs going forward include the severity of the injuries alleged by each pending claimant  increases or decreases in leslie s average settlement costs  possible adverse or favorable jury verdicts  rulings on unresolved legal issues in various jurisdictions that bear on leslie s legal liability  the numbers of claims that will be dismissed with no indemnity payments  the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards in different jurisdictions  and the potential bankruptcies of other companies named as defendants in asbestos related claims 
as a result of these factors  leslie is unable to estimate a range of additional losses that may be reasonably possible in the event that actual indemnity costs of resolving pending claims are higher than our estimate 
in addition  while the likelihood of future claims is probable  leslie s management cannot estimate the amount of future claims or any range of losses that may be reasonably possible arising from such claims 
with respect to current claims  critical information is known regarding such factors as disease mix  jurisdiction and identity of plaintiff s counsel 
such information is of course unknown with respect to any future claims  and leslie s management believes that the disease mix  jurisdictional information and plaintiff counsel identity associated with its current case experience  which has been both limited and variable  cannot reasonably be extrapolated to any future filings 
moreover  leslie management believes that appellate actions recently commenced and currently pending in certain jurisdictions such as california  together with movements toward legislative and judicial reform in such jurisdictions  may significantly alter the litigation landscape  thus affecting both the rate at which claims may be filed as well as the likelihood of incurring indemnity amounts on account of such future claims and the level of indemnity that may be incurred to resolve such claims 
experience and financial statement impact during  there were asbestos claims filed and claims resolved with respect to leslie 
for the year ended december   leslie s gross asbestos indemnity and defense costs totaled million of which million was paid by insurance 
leslie s insurance coverage is further discussed below 
this compares to million gross asbestos indemnity and defense costs paid in of which million was paid by insurance 
the following tables provide more specific information regarding leslie s claim activity and defense costs during each of the three years ended december    and as well as the financial impact of the asbestos litigation on the company for such periods excluding open mississippi cases for which we anticipate dismissal of virtually all such cases for the reasons described above for the year ended december beginning open cases cases filed cases resolved and dismissed ending open cases ending open mesothelioma cases 
table of contents for the year ended december in thousands indemnity costs accrued adverse verdicts accrued indemnity and interest costs verdicts appealed defense cost incurred insurance recoveries accrued net pre tax asbestos expense insurance to date  leslie s insurers have paid the majority of the costs associated with its defense and settlement of asbestos related actions 
under leslie s cost sharing arrangements with its insurers  leslie s insurers have historically paid of defense and settlement costs associated with asbestos related claims and leslie was responsible for the remaining of all such defense and indemnity costs 
the amount of indemnity available under leslie s primary layer of insurance coverage was therefore reduced by of any amounts paid through settlement or verdict 
during the third quarter  one of leslie s insurers that paid of leslie s historical asbestos defense and indemnity costs informed leslie that it had reached its maximum indemnity obligation under the applicable insurance policy 
therefore  leslie became responsible for of asbestos related defense and indemnity costs until such time as the aggregate amount of indemnity claims actually paid out by the remaining two primary layer insurance carriers exceed policy limits 
more recently  however  the insurer in question has indicated that its calculations concerning policy exhaustion were incorrect 
as a result  that carrier will be obligated to reimburse leslie for a portion of the additional indemnity and defense costs incurred by leslie since the insurer s original notification 
nonetheless  we believe that  upon making such reimbursement  the insurer will have completed its obligations to leslie under the policy and leslie will be responsible for of defense and indemnity costs until such time as the aggregate amount of indemnity claims actually paid out by the remaining two primary layer insurance carriers exceed the applicable policy limits 
as of december   we believe that the aggregate amount of indemnity on a cash basis remaining on leslie s primary layer of insurance was approximately million 
after giving effect to our accrual for adverse verdicts currently on appeal  the remaining amount of leslie s primary layer of insurance is million 
from a financial statement perspective  however  after giving effect to our accrual for the estimated indemnity cost of resolving pending claims  leslie recorded the maximum amount of available primary layer insurance as of september as a result  any further asbestos related indemnity costs will no longer be partially offset by a corresponding insurance recovery 
however  defense costs  recognized as incurred  will continue to be partially offset by an insurance recovery of until such time as the aggregate amount of indemnity claims actually paid out by the remaining two primary layer insurance carriers exceeds policy limits 
while we cannot reasonably predict when this primary layer will be fully exhausted  if leslie s rate of settlements were to continue at a pace consistent with the past year  and  assuming no payments on account of any adverse verdicts  policy limits would be reached within approximately two to three years 
if however  leslie were to be required to make payments on account of any adverse verdicts  the time period within which such policy limits would be reached could be significantly shorter than two to three years 

table of contents in addition to its primary layer of insurance  leslie does have limited available excess insurance coverage 
however  some of this excess insurance lies above layers of excess insurance written by insolvent insurers  which could affect when leslie may be able to recover this excess insurance 
moreover  unlike primary policies under which defense costs do not erode policy limits  the terms of excess policies typically provide that covered defense costs do erode policy limits 
as a result  upon exhaustion of its primary layer of insurance  leslie will become responsible for a substantial majority of any indemnity and defense costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
expected limitations and other matters we believe that payment of any litigation related asbestos liabilities of leslie leslie currently constitutes approximately of the company s consolidated revenues and of the company s shareholders equity is legally limited to the net assets of that subsidiary 
this belief is based on the principle of american law that a shareholder including a parent corporation is generally not liable for an incorporated entity s obligations 
smaller numbers of asbestos related claims have also been filed against two of our other subsidiaries spence  the stock of which we acquired in  and hoke  the stock of which we acquired in due to the nature of the products supplied by these entities  the markets they serve and our historical experience in resolving these claims  we do not believe that asbestos related claims will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of spence or hoke  or the financial condition  consolidated results of operations or liquidity of the company

overview circor international  inc is a leading provider of valves and other highly engineered products that allow customers around the world to use fluid safely and efficiently in the instrumentation  fluid regulation  aerospace and energy markets 
we offer one of the industry s broadest and most diverse range of products a range that allows us to supply end users with a wide array of valves and component products for fluid systems 
we have organized the company into two segments instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products and energy products 
the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment serves our broadest variety of end markets  including military and commercial aerospace  chemical processing  marine  power generation  commercial hvac systems  petroleum and gas processing and refining  food and beverage processing  medical equipment and other general industrial markets 
the energy products segment primarily serves the oil and gas exploration  production and distribution markets 
our growth strategy includes organic profitable growth as well as strategic acquisitions that extend our current offering of engineered flow control products 
for organic growth  our businesses focus on developing new products and reacting quickly to changes in market conditions in order to help grow our revenues 
regarding acquisitions  we have made thirteen acquisitions in the last seven years that extended our product offerings 
our acquisitions of loud in january and industria in october provided us with complementary aerospace component and subassembly manufacturing capabilities 
in february  we acquired two businesses hale hamilton and its subsidiary cambridge fluid systems  a leading provider of high pressure valves and flow control equipment  and sagebrush 
table of contents which provides pipeline flow control and measurement equipment to oil and gas markets 
in july  we purchased the assets of sei  a leader in the design of pneumatic controls and inflation systems for the aerospace  marine  defense  and industrial markets 
in may  we acquired motor tech  a leader in the design and manufacture of specialty electric motors  actuators  and tachometers for aerospace  defense  medical and transportation markets 
regarding our financial results  we had record revenues of million  a increase over with double digit growth in both segments as a result of a strong backlog entering the year  favorable foreign exchange rate impacts of million  and robust end markets during the first half of our net loss was million and our diluted earnings were a loss of per share 
special charges that substantially consist of non cash goodwill and intangible asset impairments resulted in a million reduction in net income 
we enter with significantly more uncertainty than we did with an ending backlog of million as of december  which is million lower than million as of december  the recent macroeconomic factors impacting global credit markets  the drop in oil and gas prices  large swings in global currencies and general weakness in most business industries have reduced our revenue and earnings outlook compared to while the magnitude and timing of deteriorating economic conditions on our businesses are highly volatile  we have proactively developed and are ready to implement other contingency plans in order to protect market share  quality of earnings and cash flow 
at the same time  we are continuing to dedicate resources to pursuing and achieving certain strategic deployment objectives which  we believe  will enable us to emerge from economic recession even stronger than we entered it 
during across the company  we continued to strengthen our management teams and accelerated our lean operating improvement initiatives  both with respect to our manufacturing operations and to our front and back office processes 
these efforts contributed to improvements in both our energy products and instrumentation and thermal fluids segments 
the energy products segment achieved record revenues and record operating margins in our instrumentation and thermal fluid products segment  while adversely impacted by a non cash special charge for an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets and an increase in our asbestos costs related to leslie  also achieved record revenues and realized meaningful operational improvements during regarding cash flow in  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million  or of revenues  an increase of million compared to million generated in the increase from resulted primarily from greater profitability before adjusting for impairment charges compared to we also used million of cash for investing activities and million in financing activities 
as of december   we believe we remain a well capitalized company with total debt to total shareholders equity of 
basis of presentation all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to currently reported 
table of contents presentations 
we monitor our business in two segments instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products and energy products 
we operate and report financial information using a week fiscal year ending december the data periods contained within our quarterly reports on form q reflect the results of operations for the week  week and week periods which generally end on the sunday nearest the calendar quarter end date 
critical accounting policies the following discussion of accounting policies is intended to supplement the section summary of significant accounting policies presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to certain of these policies are initially based on our best estimates at the time of original entry in our accounting records 
adjustments are recorded when our actual experience  or new information concerning our expected experience  differs from underlying initial estimates 
these adjustments could be material if our actual or expected experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
we make frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood of material adjustments 
except for income taxes and a change in the measurement of pension liabilities  there have been no significant changes from the methodology applied by management for critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in our annual report on form k 
the methodology applied to management s estimate for income taxes has changed due to the implementation of a new accounting pronouncement as described below and in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  no significant post delivery obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs invoiced to customers are recorded as components of revenues and the associated costs are recorded as cost of revenues 
allowance for inventory we typically analyze our inventory aging and projected future usage on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of our inventory allowances 
we provide inventory allowances for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventories determined primarily by estimates of future demand 
the allowance is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and estimated market value and charged to the provision for inventory  which is a component of our cost of revenues 
assumptions about future demand are one of the primary factors utilized to estimate market value 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
our net inventory balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  our inventory allowance as of december  was million  compared 
table of contents to million as of december  our provision for inventory obsolescence was million  million  and million  for   and  respectively 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain adequate inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements 
penalty accruals some of our customer agreements  primarily in our project related businesses  contain late shipment penalty clauses whereby we are contractually obligated to pay consideration to our customers if we do not meet specified shipment dates 
the accrual for estimated penalties is shown as a reduction of revenue and is based on several factors including limited historical customer settlement experience and management s assessment of specific shipment delay information 
accruals related to these potential late shipment penalties as of the december  and were million and million  respectively 
as we conclude performance under these agreements  the actual amount of consideration paid to our customers may vary significantly from the amounts we currently have accrued 
concentrations of risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and trade receivables 
a significant portion of our revenue and receivables are from customers who are either in or service the energy  industrial  and aerospace markets 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses 
during and  the company has not experienced any significant losses related to the collection of our accounts receivable 
for the year ended december   we had one customer in our energy products segment that accounted for of the company s consolidated revenues 
for the year ended december   we had no customers with revenues that exceeded the threshold of of the company s consolidated revenues 
purchase accounting in connection with our acquisitions  we assess and formulate a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity 
this process begins during the due diligence process and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition 
our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques for industrial manufacturing companies and we typically utilize third party valuation firms to assist in the valuation of certain tangible and intangible assets 
we accrue estimates for certain costs  related primarily to personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings  anticipated at the date of acquisition  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
business combinations and emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business 
table of contents combination 
adjustments to these estimates are made during the acquisition allocation period  which is generally up to twelve months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized 
subsequent to the allocation period  costs incurred in excess of the recorded acquisition accruals are generally expensed as incurred and if accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose the excess is recorded as an adjustment to the cost of the acquired entity  usually decreasing goodwill 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings  some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
for more information related to our outstanding legal proceedings  see contingencies and guarantees in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as legal proceedings in part i  item impairment analysis as required by sfas no  goodwill and intangible assets  we perform an annual assessment as to whether there was an indication that goodwill and certain intangible assets are impaired 
we also perform impairment analyses whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill or certain intangibles may be impaired 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill  we use our best estimates of future cash flows of operating activities and capital expenditures of the reporting unit  the estimated terminal value for each reporting unit  and a discount rate based on weighted average cost of capital 
certain negative macroeconomic factors began to impact the global credit markets in late and we noted significant adverse trends in business conditions in the fourth quarter of concurrent with these adverse developments  we commenced our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and certain intangible assets 
in connection with preparing the impairment assessment  we identified deterioration in the expected future financial performance of our instrumentation and thermal fluid controls segment compared to the expected future financial performance of this segment at the end of we also determined that the appropriate discount rate based on weighted average cost of capital as of december  was significantly higher than the discount rate used in our impairment assessment 
as a result  we recognized goodwill and intangible impairments of million and million  respectively  within the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls segment for the year ended december  if our estimates or related projections change in the future due to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 

table of contents the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million compared with million as of december  the amounts of our non amortizing intangible assets were million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of our goodwill in or as a result of the evolving factors associated with leslie s asbestos matters  our outlook of diminished future cash flow for leslie  which is reported in our instrumentation and thermal fluid controls  was an indicator of impairment that triggered an impairment analysis on the long lived assets of leslie s in accordance with sfas no 
in the fourth quarter as part of our year end closing process  with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm  an updated sfas no 
impairment analysis was performed again for leslie 
this analysis led us to conclude that the fair value of leslie s long lived assets was at least equal to net book value  and no impairment charge was necessary 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of research and product development tax credits  extraterritorial income exclusion  domestic manufacturing deduction  state taxes  and the tax impact of non us operations 
our effective tax rate was   and  for   and  respectively 
the tax rate for included the tax impact of an adjustment for goodwill and intangible impairment of million for which the tax basis was million 
excluding the goodwill and impairment charge  the effective tax rate would have been 
for  we expect an effective income tax rate of 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in  deferred income tax liabilities decreased primarily due to the reversal of prior depreciation differences  amortization relating to non goodwill intangibles and the impairment charge related to tax basis goodwill 
tax basis goodwill will continue to be amortized over its remaining life 
deferred income tax assets increased primarily due to an increase in other comprehensive income  accrued expenses and the shift of the goodwill related deferred tax from a deferred tax liability to a deferred tax asset following the impairment charge 
regarding deferred income tax assets  we maintained a total valuation allowance of million at december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets  primarily consisting of certain foreign tax credits  state net operating losses and state tax credits carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to 
table of contents establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which became effective for us beginning in fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the result of the company s reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with fin did not have a material impact on the results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
it is the company s policy to record estimated interest and penalties as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense 
the company recognizes both interest and penalties as part of the income tax provision 
during the year ended december   the company recognized approximately million in interest 
as of december   accrued interest and penalties were million 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   the liability for uncertain income tax positions was million 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
for additional information regarding the adoption of fin  see income taxes in note  of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we maintain two pension benefit plans  a qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan and a nonqualified  noncontributory defined benefit supplemental plan that provides benefits to certain highly compensated officers and employees 
to date  the supplemental plan remains an unfunded plan 
these plans include significant pension benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
benefits are based primarily on years of service and employees compensation 
as of july   in connection with a revision to our retirement plan  we froze the pension benefits of our qualified noncontributory plan participants 
under the revised plan  such participants generally do not accrue any additional benefits under the defined benefit plan after july  and will instead receive enhanced benefits associated with our defined contribution k plan in which substantially all of our us employees are eligible to participate 

table of contents effective december  we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this statement requires employers to recognize in their balance sheets the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit post retirement plans  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
employers must recognize the change in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the change occurs through other comprehensive income 
this statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employers balance sheet date 
we adopted the measurement provisions of sfas beginning january  see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our benefit plans 
prior to the adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 we accounted for our pension benefit plans under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
sfas no 
required that a liability minimum pension liability be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation abo exceeded the combined fair value of plan assets and accumulated pension cost 
any adjustment was recorded as a non cash charge to other comprehensive income in shareholders equity deficit 
sfas no 
required that the liability recorded should represent the actuarial present value of all future benefits attributable to an employee s service rendered to date 
under both sfas no 
and no 
 changes in the funded status were not immediately recognized  rather they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods 
upon adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 the company recognized the amounts of prior changes in the funded status of its post retirement benefit plans through other comprehensive income loss 
assets of our qualified pension plan are comprised of equity investments of companies in the united states with large and small market capitalizations  fixed income securities issued by the united states government  or its agencies  and certain international equities 
there are no common shares of circor in the plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was for compared to for for the qualified plan  the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expense for was compared to for for the nonqualified plan  the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expenses for was compared to in the effect of the discount rate changes for lowered our projected benefit obligation by approximately million and had a negligible impact on our pension expense 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor are being recognized over approximately a ten year period  which represents the weighted average expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
the fair value of our defined benefit plans assets at december  was less than the estimated projected benefit obligations 
the fair value of plan assets declined million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the company s net pension 
table of contents liability increased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our benefit plans 
during  we did not make any cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans 
in  we do not expect to make voluntary cash contributions  although global capital market and interest rate fluctuations will impact future funding requirements 
we derive our discount rate utilizing a commonly known pension discount curve  discounting future projected benefit obligation cash flows to arrive at a single equivalent rate 
for  we utilized as our discount rate for our pension plans on a weighted average basis given the level of yield on corporate bond interest rates 
since there was no change in the assumed rate used for compared to  there should be no impact on our projected benefit obligation or pension expense 
we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  such adjustments could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
if the actual operation of the plans differ from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
if we are required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be reduced

table of contents net revenue net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net revenues for the year ended december  was attributable to the following segment year ended total change acquisitions divestiture operations foreign exchange december  december  in thousands instrumentation thermal fluids control energy total the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the energy products segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in revenues was the net result of several factors 
this segment s customer orders increased in compared to business units in this segment benefited from higher volumes and selling prices 
in addition  revenue increased an incremental million as a result of the may acquisition of motor tech which complemented this segment s sales to aerospace  defense  medical and transportation end markets 
this segment s year to date revenues also included a million increase due to higher foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
the outlook for this segment has significantly more uncertainty than we had entering this segment s order backlog ended million higher than the fourth quarter of however  we have seen some recent declines in hvac  semiconductor and other general industry markets partially offset by strength in multi year military aerospace 
due to the volatility and uncertainty in these markets  as well as currency fluctuations  at this time we are uncertain of the magnitude and duration of these potential declines and the impact on this segment 
energy products revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in revenues was the net result of an incremental million from organic increases in revenues which included million for large international projects and fabricated systems in north america and the balance from standard products sold through distribution 
we believe the total organic revenue increase resulted from an escalation in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas that has motivated producers to increase their drilling  production  and distribution facilities 
this segment s revenues also included an million increase over due to higher foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar

this segment s customer orders increased in compared to  excluding a small business sold in business units in this segment benefited from higher volumes and selling prices 
revenue increased an incremental million from the february acquisition of hale hamilton which complemented this segment s sales to general industrial  power generation  aerospace  and chemical processing end markets 
the increase in on net revenues is also net of a decrease of revenues from our december sale of the small  break even french business  soci t alsacienne regulaves thermiques von rohr  sa sart  which had million of revenue in this segment s year to date revenues also included a million increase due to higher foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
energy products revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in revenues was the net result of an incremental million from organic increases in revenues which included million for large international projects and fabricated systems in north america and the balance from standard products sold through distribution 
the total organic revenue increase resulted from an escalation in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas that has motivated producers to increase their drilling  production  and distribution facilities 
this segment s revenues for standard products sold through distribution declined in the second half of due to lower orders resulting from wet weather conditions in the midwest in june and july and by distributors normalizing their stocking levels  after over buying from manufacturers during and early due to tight supply of products 
we expect our distributors to have completed their re balancing of inventories by the first quarter of revenues in also increased an incremental million from the february acquisition of sagebrush which produces fabricated measuring  metering  and control sub systems for pipeline applications in the north america oil and gas markets 
this segment s revenues also included an million increase due to higher foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
the increase in end market demand resulted in this segment s customer backlog being higher as of december   compared to the same period last year and nearly equivalent to the end of the third quarter of gross profit consolidated gross profit increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for consolidated gross margin of for was an increase of basis points from gross profit for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in gross profit increased on higher unit volume increases related to market growth and selective customer price increases  however  these increases were partially offset by higher costs 
the higher costs included continuing higher raw material costs  especially brass  stainless steel and other nickel based alloys  and 
table of contents we were not able to fully offset these additional costs via higher prices to customers 
also  with higher capacity utilization at critical vendors  we spent additional amounts to counteract decreased vendor responsiveness and lengthened lead times to receive certain critical parts 
further  we experienced lower factory productivity from re organizing production flow in three of this segment s us plants 
measures enacted to counter these factors include outsourcing and foreign sourcing to lower the cost of goods sold  focusing lean manufacturing priorities to achieve more linear and efficient production levels  and ensuring predictable flow of inventory from global suppliers 
one result of counter measures taken was the closing in the first quarter of of a us plant with similar production now being sourced from asian suppliers 
this plant closing resulted in a special charge cost in of million  of which million was recorded in each of the first two quarters of the annual savings of this closure and foreign sourcing counter measure is expected to be million 
gross profit for the energy products segment increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase included an incremental million from the february acquisition of sagebrush and million increase in gross profit due to higher foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
the remainder of the increase resulted from operational improvements higher unit shipments to meet the strong global demand  customer price increases  and further increases in foreign sourcing which helped to lower cost of goods sold and improved linearity in production activities

selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy products segment increased only million despite its revenue growth 
this increase was due to higher foreign exchange rates for the euro  incremental expense from our february acquisition of sagebrush  and higher commissions 
corporate  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily from higher benefit costs and professional fees 
asbestos charges  net asbestos charges are associated with our leslie subsidiary in the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls segment

net income net income increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for this increase is primarily attributable to increased profitability of our energy products segment  incremental contributions from two acquisitions in february  gains from the sale of a small european business and a former site in china  and lower interest expense partially offset by higher production  selling  and asbestos related litigation costs incurred by a subsidiary in our instrumentation and thermal fluid products segment and higher corporate expenses 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in machinery  equipment and the improvement of facilities  funding working capital requirements to support business growth initiatives  acquisitions  dividend payments  pension funding obligations and debt service costs 
we continue to generate cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position  with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses  strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure on a short and long term basis 
the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated in thousands cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash balances increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents during the year ended december   we generated million in cash flow from operating activities which was million more than the cash flow generated during the twelve months ended december   primarily due to higher net income after excluding non cash related goodwill and intangible impairment charges 
the million used by investing activities included a net million for the purchase of investments  million used for the net purchase of capital equipment  and million for the motor tech acquisition  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of assets  property  plant  and equipment 
financing activities used million which included a net million of debt payments and million in dividends paid to shareholders  offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of share based compensation and related income tax effects 
as of december   total debt was million compared to million for the year ended total debt as a percentage of total shareholders equity was as of december  compared to as of december  in december  we entered into a new five year  unsecured bank agreement that provided a million revolving credit facility and we terminated the previously available million revolving credit facility 
in october  we amended our credit agreement to increase the unsecured revolving credit facility to million and to allow for additional indebtedness not to exceed million 
this revolving credit facility is available to support our acquisition program  working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
at december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and million allocated to support outstanding letters of credit 
certain of our loan agreements contain covenants that require  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios and also limit our ability to enter into secured and unsecured borrowing arrangements  issue dividends to shareholders  acquire and dispose of businesses  transfer assets among domestic and international entities  participate in certain higher yielding long term investment vehicles  and issue additional shares of our stock 
we were in compliance with all covenants related to our existing debt obligations at december  and december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  compared to at december  cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  compared to million as of december  in  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities sufficient to support our capital expenditures  payments to reduce our outstanding revolving credit facility balance to zero and pay dividends approximating million based on our current dividend practice of paying per share annually 
based on our expected cash flows from operations and contractually available borrowings under our credit facilities  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund working capital needs and future growth 
we continue to search for strategic acquisitions in the flow control market 
a larger acquisition may require additional borrowings and or the issuance of our common stock 
the public and private capital and credit markets in the united states and around the world continue to experience extreme volatility  disruption and general slowdown at unprecedented levels 
this has spawned an unprecedented deterioration in many industrial markets including several of the markets into which we sell our products 
the breadth  depth and duration of this crisis remains uncertain 
these conditions can adversely affect our revenue  results of operations and overall financial growth 

table of contents additionally  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
although we do not currently anticipate a need to access the credit markets for new financing in the short term  a prolonged constriction on future lending by banks or investors could result in higher interest rates on future debt obligations or could restrict our ability to obtain sufficient financing to meet our long term operational and capital needs or could limit our ability in the future to consummate strategic acquisitions 
the current uncertainty and turmoil in the credit markets may also negatively impact the ability of our customers and vendors to finance their operations which  in turn  could result in a decline of our sales and in our ability to obtain necessary raw materials and components  thus potentially having an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

the interest on the revolving credit facility  as well as interest on certain of our other debt balances  with scheduled repayment dates between and and interest rates ranging between and  have been included in the interest payments on debt line within the contractual cash obligations schedule 
the most significant of our commercial contract commitments includes approximately million of commitments related to open purchase orders 
all of these open purchase orders are not expected to extend beyond as of december   we did not have any open purchase order commitments that extend beyond we did not contribute to our pension plan trust during the fiscal years ended december  and we do not expect to make plan contributions for the estimates for plan funding for future periods may change as a result of the uncertainties concerning the return on plan assets  the number of

new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a us gaap framework for measuring fair value  and expands financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements 
we adopted sfas on january  the adoption of this standard had no material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which permits a one year deferral in applying the measurement provisions of sfas to non financial assets and non financial liabilities non financial items that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entity s financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
therefore  if the change in fair value of a non financial item is not required to be recognized or disclosed in the financial statements on an annual basis or more frequently  the effective date of application of sfas to that item is deferred until fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of fsp will have on our consolidated financial statements

r  business combinations  which establishes principles for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in a business combination  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination 
we are required to apply this statement prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the oil and gas markets historically have been subject to cyclicality depending upon supply and demand for crude oil  its derivatives and natural gas 
when oil or gas prices decrease expenditures on maintenance and repair decline rapidly and outlays for exploration and in field drilling projects decrease and  accordingly  demand for valve products is reduced 
however  when oil and gas prices rise  maintenance and repair activity and spending for facilities projects normally increase and we benefit from increased demand for valve products 
however  oil or gas price increases may be considered temporary in nature or not driven by customer demand and  therefore  may result in longer lead times for increases in petrochemical sales orders 
as a result  the timing and magnitude of changes in market demand for oil and gas valve products are difficult to predict 
similarly  although not to the same extent 
table of contents as the oil and gas markets  the general industrial  chemical processing  aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand 
these fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity risk as of december   our primary interest rate risk is related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our industrial revenue bond 
the interest rates for our revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bond fluctuate with changes in short term borrowing rates 
we had million borrowed under our revolving credit facility as of december  based upon expected levels of borrowings under our revolving credit facility in and our current balance for our industrial revenue bond  an increase in variable interest rates of basis points would have an effect on our annual results of operations and cash flows of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
to the extent the underlying transactions hedged are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate movements because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
our foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments and  therefore  do not qualify for fair value or cash flow hedge treatment under the criteria of statement no 
therefore  the unrealized gains and losses on our contracts have been recognized as a component of other expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we had two forward contracts to sell currencies with a face value of million which approximates fair value 
this compares to seven forward contracts to sell currencies with a face value of million which approximates fair value as of december  we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
risk management strategies are reviewed and approved by senior management before implementation
