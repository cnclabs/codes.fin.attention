item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate overview we develop  manufacture  market and distribute single use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system  many of which are used with our proprietary excimer laser system 
more than spectranetics laser systems are used in hospitals worldwide 
excimer laser technology delivers relatively cool ultraviolet energy to ablate  or remove  multiple lesion morphology types which include plaque  calcium and thrombus 
our laser system includes the cvx laser unit and various disposable fiber optic laser catheters 
our laser catheters contain up to small diameter  flexible optical fibers that can access difficult to reach peripheral and coronary anatomy and produce evenly distributed laser energy at the tip of the catheter for more uniform ablation 
we believe that our excimer laser system is the only laser system approved in the united states  europe  japan and canada for use in multiple  minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures 
our vascular intervention disposable products include a range of peripheral and cardiac laser catheters for ablation of occluded arteries above and below the knee and within coronary arteries 
we also market non laser aspiration catheters for the removal of thrombus and non laser support catheters to facilitate crossing of coronary and peripheral arterial blockages 
our lead management disposable product line includes excimer laser sheaths and cardiac lead management accessories for the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads 
although of our revenue was derived in the united states for the year ended december   we also have regulatory approval to market our products in two key international markets 
in europe  we have the required approvals to market our products for the same indications that are approved in the united states 
we have also received approval to market certain coronary atherectomy products in japan  and are seeking additional approvals there for our newer coronary  peripheral and lead removal products 
our distributor  dvx japan  is assisting us in pursuing reimbursement approval in japan 
we do not expect significant revenue increases in japan unless and until reimbursement approval is received from the mhlw in japan 
in  the fda approved for commercialization our cvx laser system and the first generation of our fiber optic coronary atherectomy catheters 
several improvements and additions to our coronary atherectomy product line have been made since and have been approved for commercialization by the fda 
in  we secured fda approval to use our excimer laser system for removal of pacemaker and defibrillator leads  and we secured fda approval in to market certain products for use in restenosed clogged stents thin steel mesh tubes used to support the walls of coronary arteries as a pretreatment prior to brachytherapy radiation therapy 
in april  we received k marketing clearance from the fda for our clirpath excimer laser catheters which are indicated for use in the endovascular treatment of symptomatic infrainguinal lower extremity vascular disease when total obstructions are not crossable with a guidewire 
the data submitted to the fda showed that the limb salvage rate no major amputations among the patients treated was for those patients surviving six 
table of contents months following the procedure 
there was no difference in serious adverse events as compared with the entire set of patients treated in the laci laser angioplasty for critical limb ischemia trial 
in october  we received k clearance from the fda to incorporate several new features hz capability  continuous on lasing and lubricous coating into our entire clirpath product line 
the launch of this clirpath turbo product line  to replace the clirpath catheters  was completed in the third quarter of in october  we received fda clearance to market our turbo elite tm product line  which added improved pushability  trackability and ablation capability as a result of an improved outer jacket and inner guidewire lumen  as well as additional laser fibers in most sizes  to our clirpath turbo lines 
we launched a limited market release of these products in the fourth quarter of  with full transition to this product line substantially complete as of the end of the first quarter of in july  we received clearance from the fda to market our turbo booster product for the treatment of arterial stenoses and occlusions in the leg 
the turbo booster functions as a guiding catheter facilitating directed ablation of blockages in the main arteries at or above the knee 
the turbo booster combined with turbo elite laser catheters allows for removal of large amounts of plaque material within the sfa and popliteal artery 
this approval represented a broader indication for use as compared to previous labeling of the existing peripheral laser catheters 
we began a limited market launch of the turbo booster product in the third quarter of  and a full launch was completed in the fourth quarter of in may  we completed the acquisition of the endovascular business of kensey nash corporation knc 
pursuant to an asset purchase agreement among us and knc  we purchased from knc all of the assets related to knc s quickcat  thromcat and safecross product lines for million in cash  including acquisition costs of million and including a first milestone payment of million paid to knc in october the primary reason for the acquisition of these product lines was to leverage our existing sales organization while extending our product offering in the area of thrombus management 
under the terms of the agreement  we will pay knc an additional million once cumulative sales of the acquired products reach million  and up to million is payable based on various product development and regulatory milestones associated with the next generation thromcat devices 
we simultaneously entered into a manufacturing and license agreement pursuant to which knc will manufacture for us the endovascular products acquired by us under the asset purchase agreement  and we will purchase such products exclusively from knc for specified time periods 
revenue from these products subsequent to the acquisition date will be included in our reported vascular intervention disposable products revenue 
additionally  we and knc also entered into a development and regulatory services agreement pursuant to which knc will conduct work to develop  on our behalf  certain next generation safecross and thromcat products at knc s expense 
we will own all intellectual property resulting from this development work 
if clinical studies are required to obtain regulatory approval from the fda for those next generation products  the costs will be shared equally by us and knc 
knc additionally will be responsible  at its own expense  for regulatory filings with the fda that are required to obtain regulatory approval from the fda for the next generation products 
on september   we were jointly served by the fda and the ice with a search warrant issued by the united states district court  district of colorado 
the search warrant requested information and correspondence relating to i the promotion  use  testing  marketing and sales regarding certain of the company s products for the treatment of in stent restenosis  payments made to medical personnel and an identified institution for this application  ii the promotion  use  testing  experimentation  delivery  marketing and sales of catheter guidewires and balloon catheters manufactured by certain third parties outside of the united states  iii two post market studies completed during the period from to and payments to medical personnel in connection with those studies and iv compensation packages for certain of the company s personnel 
we are cooperating with the appropriate authorities regarding this matter 
see part i  item  legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies for a discussion of this and other legal proceedings in which we are involved 
on october   we announced that our board of directors appointed emile j 
geisenheimer  the board chairman  to the additional roles of president and chief executive officer

table of contents revenue and gross margin revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is mainly attributable to a increase in disposable products revenue  which consists of single use catheter products  and a increase in laser revenue 
our product mix remained relatively consistent from to  with of our revenue coming from disposables  from laser sales and rentals  and of revenue from service and other 
we separate our disposable products revenue into two separate categories vascular intervention vi and lead management lm 
for the year  our vi revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue and our lm revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue 
for the year  our vi revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue and our lm revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue 
vi revenue  which includes products used in both the peripheral and coronary vascular systems  grew in as compared with vi revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases in our quick cross support catheter  unit volume increases from the continued penetration of our peripheral laser atherectomy product lines  as well as post acquisition date revenue from the endovascular product lines acquired from kensey nash corporation on may  vi revenue growth in slowed in comparison to due primarily to what we believe is a heightened competitive environment in atherectomy procedures 
from the end of to the end of the  our installed laser base increased from to lasers worldwide  an increase of 
vi revenue growth from current levels will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to increase market acceptance of our turbo elite  turbo booster and quick cross product lines  our ability to continue to increase the worldwide installed base of lasers  our ability to increase market acceptance of the endovascular products acquired from kensey nash  and the future success of our ongoing clinical research and product development activities 
lead management revenue grew for the year ended december   as compared with the year 
we continue to believe our lm revenue is increasing primarily as a result of the increase in the use of icds  devices that regulate heart rhythm 
the current standard of care in this market is to cap leads and leave them in the body rather than remove them 
we estimate that the vast majority of replaced pacemaker or defibrillator leads are capped and left in the body 
we have established a dedicated lead management sales organization to increase awareness of potential complications associated with leaving abandoned or non functioning leads in the body  in addition to other market development activities 
laser equipment revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
laser sales revenue  which is included in laser equipment revenue  increased to million in from million in we sold laser units as outright sales from inventory and four conversions from rental units during as compared to laser units as outright sales from inventory and six sales conversions from rental units during rental revenue increased during  from million in to million in this increase is due primarily to the increase in our installed rental base of laser systems  which increased from at december  to at december  service and other revenue increased to million in as compared to million in the increase was due primarily to the increased installed base of laser units 
our worldwide installed base of laser systems which includes outright sales  rental units and evaluation units increased by during  compared with an increase of laser systems last year 
this brings our worldwide installed base of laser systems to in the us at december  gross margin for was  a decrease of two percentage points as compared with in the gross margin decline was due to higher facilities and quality assurance costs as compared with the year ago period some of which were associated with our move to a new facility in  and within disposables  a less favorable margin mix of product revenues 
in  we experienced slower growth in our higher margin laser catheters and relatively stronger growth in support catheters  which carry a slightly lower margin percentage  as well as thrombectomy products  manufactured by kensey nash  and which carry a lower margin 
additionally  laser and service margins were slightly lower than in the previous year 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses of million in increased from million in this increase is mainly due to a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and a increase in research  development and other technology expenses relative to the prior year  as well as million of in process research and development acquired from kensey nash in the second quarter of selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to marketing and selling expenses increased approximately or million in compared with the prior year primarily as a result of the following increased personnel related costs of approximately million associated with the staffing of additional employees within our us field sales and marketing organizations in as compared with average sales and marketing headcount in was compared with an average of in  total sales and marketing personnel totaled employees at december  as compared with at december  these costs include salaries and related taxes  recruiting  and travel costs 
increased commissions of approximately million  which is mainly due to the increase in revenues and additional employees 
approximately million in increased sales related costs for our international operations  of which approximately million was due to incremental expenses for sales and marketing activities related to the acquired kensey nash products in europe 
increased expenses of approximately million in other expenses  including depreciation  amortization  and materials 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately or million in compared with the prior year  primarily the result of the following increased legal expense of approximately million  primarily due both to costs related to the federal investigation million as well as the appeal of the rentrop verdict see note  commitments and contingencies 
increased personnel related costs of approximately million associated with the staffing of additional employees in our general and administrative departments as of the end of as compared with these costs include salaries and related taxes  benefits  recruiting  and travel costs 
increased expenses of approximately million related to outside consulting expenses due to various projects related to the needs of our expanding workforce and information technology infrastructure 
increased depreciation  insurance and other facilities related expenses of approximately million 
increased bad debt expense of million 
the above increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of approximately million included in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to the prior year  due to higher than anticipated forfeitures in research and development included in the results for is million of in process research and development expense acquired from knc as part of the endovascular product line acquisition  which is discussed in more detail in note  business combination  to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology is determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established  including technology relating to products that have not received fda approval and which 
table of contents has no alternative future use 
during the third and fourth quarters of  there was no material change in the status of the project that provided the basis for the value assigned to acquired in process technology 
research  development and other technology expenses of million for represented an increase of from million in costs included within research  development and other technology expenses are research and development costs  clinical studies costs and royalty costs associated with various license agreements with third party licensors 
the million increase is primarily due to increased personnel related costs including recruiting and travel of approximately million due primarily to the hiring of nine additional engineering  regulatory and clinical studies employees since the prior year 
increased clinical studies and regulatory expenses of approximately million related to a number of clinical studies being conducted by us that are in various stages of completion  as well as activities related to regulatory compliance 
increased royalty expenses of approximately million due to higher sales of products incorporating technology that we license 
increased prototype materials  depreciation and other facilities related expenses of approximately million due to increased r d project activity for both laser systems and disposables 
the above increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of approximately million included in research and development expenses in as compared to the prior year 
interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income in is due primarily to a lower investment portfolio balance  primarily as a result of the million paid to knc in for the endovascular product line acquisition 
lower interest rates on our invested balances also contributed to the decline in interest income 
pre tax loss for was million  compared with pre tax income of million for the current year results included the million in process research and development charge and million of investigation expenses noted above 
given the company s significant historical net operating losses which are available to offset future taxable income  any income tax expense or benefit is a non cash item 
as a result  management believes that pre tax income or loss is the most appropriate measure of its operating performance 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net income tax benefit of million against our pretax loss of million 
included in the net tax benefit for was a non cash tax benefit of million related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
this adjustment was made as a result of our quarterly assessment of our deferred tax asset as required by sfas  and the reasons for the adjustment are discussed in more detail in note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the valuation allowance adjustment  for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million against our pretax income for the period 
a portion of the company s granted stock options qualify as incentive stock options iso for income tax purposes 
as such  a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition 
due to the treatment of incentive stock options for tax purposes  our effective tax rate is subject to variability 
we recorded a net loss for the year ended december  of million  or per fully diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per fully diluted share  in the current year results included the million in process research and development charge noted above  and the prior year results included a non cash tax benefit of million related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
the functional currency of spectranetics international bv and spectranetics deutschland gmbh is the euro 
all revenue and expenses are translated to us dollars in the consolidated statements of operations using weighted average exchange rates during the year 
fluctuation in euro currency rates during year ended december  as compared with the prior year caused an increase in consolidated revenue of million and an increase in consolidated operating expenses of million  representing less than a increase as compared with the prior year

disposable products revenue was million for the year ended december   which was higher than disposable products revenue of million during the same period in we separate our disposable products revenue into two separate categories vascular intervention which includes our atherectomy and support catheter products and lead management 
for the year ended december   our vascular intervention revenue totaled million of disposable products revenue and our lead management revenue totaled 
table of contents million of our disposable products revenue 
vascular intervention revenue  which includes products used in both the coronary and peripheral vascular system  grew and was the main driver of disposable product revenue growth in compared with vascular intervention revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases from the continued penetration of our turbo elite product line  and  to a lesser extent to unit volume increases in our quick cross support catheter 
approximately of the vascular intervention revenue growth compared with the prior year was due to unit price increases related to our turbo elite product line  the launch of which was completed in the second quarter of atherectomy revenue growth from current levels will depend on our ability to increase market acceptance of the turbo elite product line and our ability to continue to increase the worldwide installed base of lasers  as well as the future success of our ongoing clinical research and product development within the coronary and peripheral atherectomy markets 
lead management revenue grew during compared with we continue to believe our lead management revenue is increasing primarily as a result of the increase in use of icds  devices that regulate heart rhythm 
recent clinical studies multicenter automatic defibrillator implantation trial ii  or madit ii  the sudden cardiac death in heart failure trial  or scdheft  and the cardiac resynchronization therapy with and without implantable defibrillator in advanced chronic heart failure trial  or companion have shown positive results expanding the patient population that may benefit from defibrillator implants 
the results of the madit clinical trial became available in  the scd heft clinical trial results were made public in march  and the companion results were published in may growth in the icd including cardiac resynchronization defibrillators or crt ds market continue to be fueled by these and other trials  depending on the establishment of referral patterns to electrophysiologists for this expanded patient pool and maintenance of appropriate reimbursement  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
generally  growth in the implantable defibrillator market contributes to growth in our lead management business 
although we expect our lead management business to continue to grow  there can be no assurances to that effect 
while removal of infected pacing and defibrillation leads is widely accepted  the predominant practice in this market is to cap non functional leads and leave them in the body rather than to remove them 
when an icd or crt d device is implanted  it often replaces a pacemaker 
in these cases  the old ventricular pacing lead may be removed to minimize the potential for venous obstruction when the new icd leads and any additional pacing leads are implanted 
we believe along with many top physicians that removal of non functional leads in many cases  especially in relatively younger patients  serves to avoid future complicating scenarios that may occur over the course of the patient s life with their implanted leads 
additionally  a large manufacturer of pacemakers and defibrillators and the related leads announced a recall of  leads in the united states marketed under the fidelis brand  due to a failure rate of these leads that was higher than that of other similar leads 
although physicians are not recommending the removal of all these fidelis leads  we expect a portion of these leads to be removed 
laser equipment revenue in was million compared with million in  which represents an increase of 
as of december  our worldwide installed base of laser systems was in the united states compared with in the united states as of december  this represents new laser placements in of laser systems net of returns compared to new laser systems placed during data as to our installed base of laser systems and new laser placements includes outright sales  rentals and lasers being evaluated during a trial period by potential purchasers 
laser sales revenue  which is included in laser equipment revenue  decreased to million for as compared to million for the decrease was due to the sale of five fewer units in compared to in  partially offset by an increase in average sale prices from  in to  in for the units sold due to a higher mix of sales from inventory as compared to rental evaluation conversions 
rental revenue increased from million in to million in  due mainly to an increase in systems placed with customers under our various rental programs  particularly our cap free program  which was introduced in the second quarter of most of our laser system placements during and related to systems placed under our cap free and evergreen rental program  as opposed to outright sales  and we expect in that most of our new laser placements will continue to be under our cap free and other rental programs 
we believe that laser system placements is a more relevant metric for measuring our progress within the equipment business  as it represents new customers that have elected to acquire a laser system  whether it be from an outright sale from 
table of contents inventory  or a rental program 
a laser system placement represents an opportunity to sell our higher margin disposable products 
service and other revenue of million during increased from million for service and other revenue is generated through the repair and maintenance services offered to our customers and is associated exclusively with our laser systems 
the growth in service and other revenue is a result of an increase in our installed base 
gross margin increased to as a percentage of revenue during the year ended december  as compared with during the year ended december  this increase was mainly due to an increase in unit prices related to our turbo elite product line due to the full year effect of a price increase instituted in and an improvement in the mix of our revenue  with a higher percentage increase in higher margin disposable products than the percentage increase in lower margin laser equipment revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  as compared with million in the increase is primarily due to the following selling expenses increased approximately million due to the following factors approximately million relates to personnel related expenses associated with the hiring of additional employees in within our sales and marketing organizations 
these increased costs include salaries and benefits  recruiting and travel costs 
an additional million of the increase relates to higher commissions expense as a result of our increased revenue compared with the prior year 
increased expenses associated with the operations of spectranetics international  bv  our wholly owned subsidiary in the netherlands that serves the european market  represented approximately million of the increase 
the majority of this increase relates to the payment of additional commissions on increased sales in europe for as compared to as well as costs associated with the hiring of two additional employees for the european sales organization  including a managing director 
additional convention  meeting and education costs  primarily the result of attendance at an increasing number of tradeshows and conventions  combined with additional physician training costs incurred primarily in peer to peer clinical training sessions  accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the remainder of the increase relates to increased materials and supplies costs consumed by our various sales and marketing departments as well as increased allocation of facilities related costs 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million as a result of increased personnel related costs of approximately million associated with increased staffing 
increased facilities related and depreciation costs of million due to the relocation of our g a departments to a leased facility in north colorado springs 
increased bad debts expense of million  which is consistent with the increase in total accounts receivable 
the above increases were partially offset by the following decreases in g a expense compared to the prior year decreased costs of approximately million as compared with related to accrued company wide incentive compensation based on financial performance in relation to established targets 
decreased legal fees of approximately million  primarily due to a reduction in the amount of legal expense associated with the rentrop lawsuit

increased outside services expense of approximately million which primarily includes increased fees paid to outside vendors assisting us with technology enhancements to our laser system 
increased amortization expense of approximately million related primarily to the purchase of an electronic document control program and two new patents 
the above increases were partially offset by the following decreases in r d expense compared to the prior year decreased royalties expense of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to the tentative verdict in the rentrop case as royalty expense 
we have made additional royalty accruals in related to the rentrop matter on subsequent sales  but the total expense recorded in is less than what was recorded in this was partially offset by increased royalties related to certain licensed technology as a result of our higher sales 
decreased materials and other supplies costs of approximately million due to reduced prototype materials expense in interest income for was million  compared with million for the increase in interest income in is mainly due to the full year effect of the invested net proceeds of the secondary stock offering we completed in the second quarter of our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of government or government agency securities with maturities less than two years

income taxes at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for united states federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
our ability to use these nols in the future may be limited 
see item a  risk factors the amount of our net operating loss carryovers may be limited 
we also have tax loss carryforwards in the netherlands  which currently expire in  of approximately million available to offset future taxable income  if any  in the netherlands 
the amount of tax loss carryforwards has been reduced from amounts previously recorded after an audit by  and negotiations with  the 
table of contents netherlands taxing authority 
these foreign loss carryforwards had been fully reserved with a valuation allowance  so the reduction adjustment had no impact on our income tax provision for an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million is available to offset future regular tax liabilities and has no expiration date 
for alternative minimum tax purposes  we have net operating loss carryforwards for united states federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
we also have research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes at december  of approximately million  which are available to reduce future federal income taxes  if any  and expire at varying dates through at december   based upon the level of historical income and projections for future income  we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million  as we have determined it is more likely than not that we will recover this amount in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the purchase of the kensey nash endovascular product line in the second quarter of for million  capital expenditures made in support of increased manufacturing capacity  including related facilities costs  of million  net purchases of investment securities of million  and cash used in operating activities of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million during the year 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and current investment securities of million 
we consider the total of cash  cash equivalents and current investment securities to be available for operating activities since the cash equivalents and current investment securities can be readily converted to cash 
as of december   we had long term investment securities of million  an increase of million from million at december  long term investment securities at december  consisted of our auction rate securities ars which we acquired in january and which are currently illiquid 
during  we recorded temporary impairment charges totaling million of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter against the million par value of our ars to their estimated fair market value of million  and the million temporary unrealized loss is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within total stockholders equity 
the reduction in fair value was deemed necessary due to the impact on the valuation of these securities of the worsening global financial crisis and the continued failure of auctions of these securities throughout the fair value of our ars at december  is based on third party pricing models and is classified as a level pricing category in accordance with sfas we utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the current fair market value for each of the securities we owned as there was no recent activity in the secondary markets in these types of securities 
this model used unique inputs for each security including discount rate  interest rate currently being paid and maturity 
if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue  if these markets deteriorate further or if we experience rating downgrades on any investments in our portfolio  including our ars  the market value of our investment portfolio may decline further  which we may determine is an other than temporary impairment 
this would result in a realized loss and would negatively affect our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
although we currently believe that our cash  cash equivalents and current investment securities balances at december  are sufficient to fund our operations through december   the outcome of the federal investigation and shareholder and derivative litigation and our obligations to indemnify and advance the legal expenses of our present and former directors  officers and agents are uncertain and may require resources beyond what we have currently available 
we cannot provide assurances that debt or equity financing  if needed  would be available on favorable terms  if at all 
see further discussion of our ars below under critical accounting polices and in note  investment securities  to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities totaled million 
the primary uses of cash were the following the net loss of million  an increase in equipment held for rental or loan of million as a result of expanding placement activity of our laser systems through cap free  rental  or evaluation programs  increased inventories of million  primarily the result of higher stocking levels to meet the increase in catheter demand  and an increase in trade accounts receivable of million due to increased sales 
the above uses of cash from operating activities were offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as well as non cash expenses of million  including depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation expense of million  and in process research and development of million  less the non cash deferred income tax benefit of million 
we continue to stay focused on the management of accounts receivable as measured by days sales outstanding and will continue this focus in with the goal of maintaining the current level of days sales outstanding  although there can be no assurances this goal will be achieved given the current economic conditions 
for the equipment held for rental or loan account  any increases will be based on the level of evaluation or rental including cap free laser placements offset by sales of laser systems previously placed under evaluation or rental programs 
we continue to expect most of our laser placement activity in to be in the form of various rental programs we offer 
the table below presents the change in receivables and inventory in relative terms  through the presentation of financial ratios 
days sales outstanding are calculated by dividing the ending accounts receivable balance  net of reserves for sales returns and doubtful accounts  by the average daily sales for the previous quarter 
inventory turns are calculated by dividing annualized cost of sales for the previous quarter by ending inventory 
december  december  days sales outstanding inventory turns for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million  including million paid for the acquisition of the kensey nash endovascular product line 
other investing activities for included capital expenditures of million  and purchases of investments net of sales of million

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of our investments in auction rate securities  the carrying amount of property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances and reserves for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  stock based compensation  and accrued royalty expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and their impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those relating to product returns  bad debts  inventories  the valuation of investment securities  the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  royalty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments and estimates form the basis for the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not objectively available from other sources 
carrying values of these assets and liabilities may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of our disposable products is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title transfers 
in general  customers do not have a right of return for credit or refund 
however  we allow returns under certain circumstances and record a provision for sales returns based on historical returns experience 
revenue from the sale of excimer laser systems is recognized after completion of contractual obligations  which generally include delivery and installation of the systems 
our field service engineers are responsible for installation of each laser 
we generally provide a one year warranty on laser sales  which includes parts  labor and replacement gas 
the fair value of this service is deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the related warranty period and warranty costs are expensed in the period they are incurred 
upon expiration of the warranty period  the company offers similar service to its customers under service contracts or on a fee for service basis 
revenue from warranty 
table of contents service and service contracts is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a straight line basis over the related service contract period  which is generally one year 
revenue from fee for service arrangements is recognized upon completion of the related service 
we offer four laser system placement programs  which are described below  in addition to the sale of laser systems cap free rental program under this program  we retain title to the laser system and the customer agrees to a catheter price list that includes a per unit surcharge 
customers are expected  but not required  to make minimum purchases of catheters at regular intervals  and we reserve the right to have the unit returned should the minimum purchases not be made 
we recognize the total surcharge as revenue upon shipment of the catheters  believing it to be the best measurement of revenue associated with the customers use of the laser unit each month 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and the depreciation expense related to the system is included in cost of revenue based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
evergreen rental program rental revenue under this program varies on a sliding scale depending on the customer s catheter purchases each month 
rental revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized upon invoicing 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and depreciation expense is recorded within cost of revenue based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
straight rental program we also offer a straight monthly rental program  and there are a small number of hospitals that pay rent of  to  per month under this program 
evaluation programs the company loans laser systems to institutions for use over a short period of time  usually three to six months 
the loan of the equipment is to create awareness of our products and their capabilities  and no revenue is earned or recognized in connection with the placement of a loaned laser  although sales of disposable products result from the laser placement 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment and depreciation expense is recorded within selling  general and administrative expense based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
we account for service provided during the one year warranty period as a separate unit of accounting in accordance with emerging issues task force bulletin eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
as such  we defer the fair value of this service and recognize it as revenue on a straight line basis over the related warranty period and warranty costs are expensed in the period they are incurred 
revenue allocated to the laser element is recognized upon completion of all contractual obligations in the sales contract  which generally includes delivery and installation of the laser system

we sell to end users in the united states and internationally as well as to certain international distributors 
sales to international distributors represented approximately of our worldwide sales in distributor agreements are in place with each distributor  which outline the significant terms of the transactions between the distributor and the company 
the terms and conditions of sales to our international distributors do not differ materially from the terms and conditions of sales to our domestic and international end user customers 
sales to distributors are recognized either at shipment or a later date in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with distributors  provided that we have received an order  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  all contractual obligations have been met and we can reasonably estimate returns 
we provide products to our distributors at agreed wholesale prices and do not typically provide any special right of return or exchange  discounts  significant sales incentives  price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 

table of contents allowance for sales returns 
we estimate product sales returns based upon an analysis of revenue transactions and historical experience of sales returns and price adjustments 
the provision for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates 
actual sales returns may vary depending on customer inventory levels  new product introductions and other factors 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  these facts are subject to change 
royalty liability 
we license certain patents from various licensors pursuant to license agreements 
royalty expense is calculated pursuant to the terms of the license agreements and is included in research  development and other technology in the accompanying financial statements 
we have established liabilities for royalty payment obligations based on these calculations  which involve management estimates that require judgment 
although we believe the estimates to be reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  the estimates are subject to change based on changes in the underlying facts and assumptions used to develop these estimates 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in their consolidated financial statements 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in sfas in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires recognition of expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model  which requires management s estimates and assumptions regarding volatility  expected term of the options  and other inputs 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december   we have a net deferred tax asset of million 
we believe that it is more likely than not that this net deferred tax asset will be realized  but there can be no assurances that our estimates are accurate or that our assumptions will not change 
valuation of purchased in process research and development iprd  goodwill and other intangible assets 
when a business combination occurs  such as the acquisition of the kensey nash endovascular product line in the second quarter of  the purchase price is allocated based upon the fair value of tangible assets  iprd  goodwill and intangible assets 
we recognize iprd in a business combination for the portion of the purchase price allocated to the appraised value of in process technologies  defined as those technologies relating to products that have not received fda approval and have no alternative future use 
valuations require the use of significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to iprd is determined by estimating future cash flows of the technology and discounting net cash flows back to present values 
we consider  among other things  the project s stage of completion  complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  costs already incurred  projected costs to complete  contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition is based on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of identifiable net assets of the business acquired and the amount allocated to iprd 
during the third and 
table of contents fourth quarters of  there was no material change in the status of the project that provided the basis for the value assigned to acquired in process technology 
valuation of auction rate securities ars 
the fair value for our ars at december  is based on third party pricing models and is classified as a level pricing category in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements 
we utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the current fair market value for each of the securities we owned as there was no recent activity in the secondary markets in these types of securities 
this model used unique inputs for each security including discount rate  interest rate currently being paid and estimated date to liquidation 
the discount rates ranged from to 
in order to calculate the discount rate  we estimated the expected yield on an average high grade municipal bond 
in our view  high grade municipal bonds are the most closely comparable security to the auction rate securities contained in our portfolio because they have similar credit quality and are government backed  as is the substantial portion of our ars portfolio through the felp program 
we utilized forecasts for the month libor based on the weighted average of the bloomberg analyst forecasts  then estimated the spread between the month libor and a high grade municipal bond to be basis points  based on current and historical market data 
because we are currently unable to withdraw from the securities  we also added a basis points illiquidity premium to the discount rate 
the estimated liquidation dates used in the valuation analysis as of december  ranged from to years  and were increased by two years as compared to the estimated liquidation dates used in the analysis we performed as of september  the additional two years to expected liquidation caused an increase in the temporary impairment recorded of million as compared to the valuation that we performed at september  at december   we also performed a sensitivity analysis in the valuation of our ars using an estimated date to liquidation of plus or minus two years and a discount rate of plus or minus basis points 
the sensitivity analysis with these parameters calculated a valuation ranging from million to million 
we believe that our current valuation of million is a reasonable measure of fair value of the securities 
the company will reassess the temporary impairment recorded in in future reporting periods based on several factors  including continued failure of auctions  failure of investments to be redeemed  deterioration of credit ratings of investments  market risk  our ability to hold the investments to maturity  and other factors 
such a reassessment may result in a conclusion that the investments are more than temporarily impaired  which would result in a charge to our consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill impairment 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  as of january  pursuant to sfas  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
sfas also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
intangible assets  which consist primarily of patents  are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from to years 
management must use significant estimates and assumptions in evaluating whether or not impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets has occurred  and in evaluating the useful lives of amortized intangible assets 
significant changes in these estimates and management s assumptions may reduce the carrying amount of these intangible assets 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted the fair value measurement and disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which establishes specific criteria for the fair value measurements of financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are already subject to fair value measurements under current accounting rules 
sfas also requires expanded disclosures related to fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb approved fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 which allows companies to elect a one year delay in applying sfas to certain fair value measurements  primarily related to nonfinancial instruments 
we elected the delayed adoption date for the 
table of contents portions of sfas impacted by fsp sfas the partial adoption of sfas was prospective and did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we expect that the application of the deferred portion of sfas to the nonrecurring fair value measurements of our nonfinancial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in accordance with fsp sfas  the fair value measurements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities will be adopted effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in october  the fasb issued fsp sfas no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
fsp sfas clarifies the application of sfas  which we adopted as of january   in situations where the market is not active 
we have considered the guidance provided by fsp sfas in our determination of estimated fair values as of december  see note  investment securities  for further discussion 
also effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas creates a fair value option under which an entity may elect to record certain financial assets or liabilities at fair value upon their initial recognition 
subsequent changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
the election of the fair value option would be made on a contract by contract basis and would need to be supported by concurrent documentation or a preexisting documented policy 
sfas requires an entity to separately disclose the fair value of these items on the balance sheet or in the footnotes to the financial statements and to provide information that would allow the financial statement user to understand the impact on earnings from changes in the fair value 
we did not elect the fair value option for any of our financial assets or liabilities 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for good or services to be used in future research and development activities 
this issue requires that nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided 
this issue was effective for us as of january   and is to be applied prospectively for new contracts entered into after that date 
the adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on the our financial statements 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
under sfas r  an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
it further requires that acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred  restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense 
the adoption of sfas r will change the accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the effects are presumed to be material to the accounting for future business acquisitions and will also increase future income statement volatility upon consummation of future business acquisitions 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
this statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap for nongovernmental entities 
prior to the issuance of sfas no 
 gaap hierarchy was defined in the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement on auditing standards sas no 
 the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we adopted sfas effective november   and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio 
we attempt to place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities  which consist of both fixed and variable rate financial instruments 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders equity  net of applicable taxes 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the value of our investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
at december   we have million of investment securities available for sale that are classified as current on our balance sheet 
since these investments have maturities of less than one year  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to have a significant impact on their fair values 
we also hold million in auction rate securities  classified as long term on our balance sheet as of december   and changes in interest rates and other assumptions in the valuation of these securities may have a significant impact on their valuation 
the underlying assets of the auction rate securities we hold are student loans which are guaranteed by the us government under the federal education loan program 
auction rate securities are collateralized long term debt instruments that historically have provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that reset the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  typically every   or days 
beginning in february  auctions failed for our holdings because sell orders exceeded buy orders 
the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security  a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the security matures 
as of december   the unrealized loss on our auction rate securities was approximately million  reducing the par value of the securities of million to their fair value of million 
at december   we also performed a sensitivity analysis in the valuation of our ars using an estimated date to liquidation of plus or minus two years and a discount rate of plus or minus basis points 
the sensitivity analysis with these parameters calculated a valuation ranging from million to million 
we will reassess the temporary impairment recorded in in future reporting periods based on several factors  including continued failure of auctions  failure of investments to be redeemed  deterioration of credit ratings of investments  market risk and other factors 
such a reassessment may result in a conclusion that the investments are more than temporarily impaired  which would result in a charge to our consolidated statement of operations 
see further discussion of our auction rate securities above under item  critical accounting polices  and in note  investment securities  to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is primarily related to sales of our products in europe  which are denominated in the euro 
changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar could adversely affect our revenue and net income 
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may increase over time as our business evolves and our products continue to be introduced into international markets 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and  as a result  could incur unanticipated gains or losses 
for the year ended december   approximately million of increased revenue and million of increased operating expenses were the result of exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to the euro as compared to the prior year 
accordingly  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on consolidated net income for the year ended december  was an increase in net income of million as compared to the prior year
