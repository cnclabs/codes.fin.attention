the industry and the economic environment the retail grocery industry can be characterized as one of continued consolidation and rationalization  with the acquisition being one of the largest acquisitions in the history of the industry 
grocery retailers also continue to compete against an increasing number of competitive formats that are adding square footage devoted to food and non food products  such as supercenters  membership warehouse clubs  mass merchandisers  dollar stores  drug stores and other alternate formats 
the unprecedented decline in the economy and credit market turmoil during fiscal combined with high food inflation and energy costs negatively impacted consumer confidence and spending 
if these trends continue  it could lead to further reduced consumer spending  to consumers trading down to a less expensive mix of products or to consumers trading down to discounters for grocery items  all of which could impact the company s sales growth 
food deflation could reduce sales growth  while food inflation  combined with reduced consumer spending  could reduce gross profit margins

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note the company and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more subjective or complex judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
vendor funds the company receives funds from many of the vendors whose products the company buys for resale in its stores 
these vendor funds are provided to increase the sell through of the related products 
the company receives vendor funds for a variety of merchandising activities placement of the vendors products in the company s advertising  display of the vendors products in prominent locations in the company s stores  supporting the introduction of new products into the company s retail stores and distribution system  exclusivity rights in certain categories  and to compensate for temporary price reductions offered to customers on products held for sale at retail stores 
the company also receives vendor funds for buying activities such as volume commitment rebates  credits for purchasing products in advance of their need and cash discounts for the early payment of merchandise purchases 
the majority of the vendor fund contracts have terms of less than a year  with a small proportion of the contracts longer than one year 

table of contents the company recognizes vendor funds for merchandising activities as a reduction of cost of sales when the related products are sold in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
vendor funds that have been earned as a result of completing the required performance under the terms of the underlying agreements but for which the product has not yet been sold are recognized as reductions of inventory 
the amount and timing of recognition of vendor funds as well as the amount of vendor funds remaining in ending inventory requires management judgment and estimates 
management determines these amounts based on estimates of current year purchase volume using forecast and historical data and review of average inventory turnover data 
these judgments and estimates impact the company s reported operating earnings and inventory amounts 
the historical estimates of the company have been reliable in the past  and the company believes the methodology will continue to be reliable in the future 
based on previous experience  the company does not expect there will be a significant change in the level of vendor support 
however  if such a change were to occur  cost of sales and advertising expense could change  depending on the specific vendors involved 
if vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated  the company would consider changing the volume  type and frequency of the advertising  which could increase or decrease its advertising expense 
similarly  the company is not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on creating additional revenues as such allowances do not directly generate revenue for the company s stores 
for fiscal  a basis point change in total vendor funds earned  including advertising allowances  with no offsetting changes to the base price on the products purchased  would impact gross profit by basis points 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
substantially all of the company s inventory consists of finished goods 
approximately percent and percent of the company s inventories were valued using the last in  first out lifo method for fiscal and  respectively 
the company uses a combination of the retail inventory method rim and replacement cost method to determine the current cost of its inventory before any lifo reserve is applied 
under rim  the current cost of inventories and the gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the current retail value of inventories 
under the replacement cost method  the most current unit purchase cost is used to calculate the current cost of inventories 
the first in  first out method fifo is used to determine cost for some of the remaining highly perishable inventories 
if the fifo method had been used to determine cost of inventories for which the lifo method is used  the company s inventories would have been higher by approximately and as of february  and february   respectively 
during fiscal  and  inventory quantities in certain lifo layers were reduced 
these reductions resulted in a liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of fiscal  and purchases 
as a result  cost of sales decreased by  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  the company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities 
allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the financial statement date 
although the company has sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for inventory shortages  it is possible that actual results could differ 
as of february   each basis point change in the estimated inventory shortages would impact the allowances for inventory shortages by approximately reserves for closed properties and related impairment charges the company maintains reserves for costs associated with closures of retail stores  distribution centers and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the company provides for closed property operating lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  reduced by estimated subtenant rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
the closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms  which 
table of contents generally range from one to years 
the company estimates subtenant rentals and future cash flows based on the company s experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions 
adjustments to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
owned properties  capital lease properties  and the related equipment and leasehold improvements at operating leased properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company estimates fair value based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located and  when necessary  utilizes local real estate brokers 
the expectations on timing of disposition and the estimated sales price or subtenant rentals associated with closed properties  owned or leased  are impacted by variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy  resultant demand for commercial property  the ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the company s success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
while management believes the current estimates of reserves for closed properties and related impairment charges are adequate  it is possible that market and economic conditions in the real estate market could cause changes in the company s assumptions and may require additional reserves and asset impairment charges to be recorded 
the company s reserve for closed properties was  net of estimated sublease recoveries of  as of february  and  net of estimated sublease recoveries of  as of february  the company recognized asset impairment charges of  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and also if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the reviews consist of comparing estimated fair value to the carrying value at the reporting unit level 
the company s reporting units are the operating segments of the business 
fair values are determined primarily by discounting projected future cash flows based on management s expectations of the current and future operating environment 
the rates used to discount projected future cash flows reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on the company s industry  capital structure and risk premiums including those reflected in the current market capitalization 
if management identifies the potential for impairment of goodwill  the fair value of the implied goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill 
an impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying value over the implied fair value 
fair value calculations contain significant judgments and estimates related to each reporting unit s projected future revenues  profitability and cash flows 
when preparing these estimates  management considers each reporting unit s historical results  current operating trends  and specific plans in place 
these estimates are impacted by variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy  and market competition 
the company has sufficient current and historical information available to support its judgments and estimates 
however  if actual results are not consistent with the company s estimates  future operating results may be materially impacted 
the company also reviews intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  which primarily consist of trademarks and tradenames  for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and also if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the reviews consist of comparing estimated fair value to the carrying value 
fair values of the company s trademarks and tradenames are determined primarily by discounting an assumed royalty value applied to projected future revenues associated with the tradename based on management s expectations of the current and future operating environment 
the royalty cash flows are then discounted using rates based on the weighted average cost of capital discussed above and the specific risk profile of the tradenames relative to the company s other assets 
these estimates are impacted by variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy  and market competition 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were  and  as of february   respectively  and  and  as of february   respectively 
for the third quarter of fiscal  the company s stock price had a significant and sustained decline and book value per share substantially exceeded the stock price 
consistent with sfas no 
 the company recorded impairment charges of  comprised of  to goodwill at certain retail food reporting units and to indefinite lived trademarks and tradenames related to the acquired trademarks and other intangible assets 
the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets reflects the significant decline in the market price of the company s common stock as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal as well as the impact of the unprecedented decline in the economy on the company s plan 
the company did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill or intangible assets during self insurance liabilities the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  healthcare for certain employees and general and automobile liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liabilities based on management s estimate of the ultimate cost of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported and related expenses  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
in determining its self insurance liabilities  the company performs a continuing review of its overall position and reserving techniques 
since recorded amounts are based on estimates  the ultimate cost of all incurred claims and related expenses may be more or less than the recorded liabilities 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  healthcare and general and automobile liability is subject to a degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  regulatory changes  benefit level changes and actual claim settlement patterns 
the majority of the self insurance liability for workers compensation is related to claims occurring in california 
california workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the state s politicians  insurers  and providers 
in recent years  there has been an increase in the number of legislative reforms and judicial rulings affecting the handling of claim activity 
the impact of many of these variables on ultimate costs is difficult to estimate 
the effects of changes in such estimated items are included in results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed 
such changes may be material to the results of operations and could occur in a future period 
if  in the future  the company was to experience significant volatility in the amount and timing of cash payments compared to its earlier estimates  the company would assess whether to continue to discount these liabilities 
the company had self insurance liabilities of approximately  net of the discount of  and  net of the discount of  as of february  and february   respectively 
as of february   each basis point change in the discount rate would impact the self insurance liabilities by approximately benefit plans the company sponsors pension and other postretirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
the determination of the company s obligation and related expense for company sponsored pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent  in part  on management s selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
the discount rate is based on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the historical experience of the company s investment portfolio and the projected returns by asset category 
over the year period ended february  and february   the average rate of return on plan assets was approximately percent and percent  respectively 
the decrease in the year average rate of return on pension assets was due to the unprecedented decline in the economy and continuing credit market turmoil during fiscal the company expects that the markets will eventually recover to the assumed long term rate of return used by the company 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense and obligation in future periods 

table of contents during fiscal  the company contributed to its pension plans and to its postretirement benefit plans  and expects to contribute to its pension plans and to its postretirement benefit plans in fiscal for fiscal  each basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately and each basis point reduction in expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense by approximately similarly  for postretirement benefits  a basis point change in the healthcare cost trend rate would impact the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of the end of fiscal by approximately and the service and interest cost by in fiscal although the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate  the actuarial assumptions may differ from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
in addition  the company contributes to various multi employer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements  primarily defined benefit pension plans 
these plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
based on available information  the company believes that some of the multi employer plans to which it contributes are underfunded 
company contributions to these plans are likely to continue to increase in the near term 
however  the amount of any increase or decrease in contributions will depend on a variety of factors  including the results of the company s collective bargaining efforts  investment return on the assets held in the plans  actions taken by the trustees who manage the plans  and requirements under the pension protection act of and section e of the internal revenue code of  as amended the internal revenue code 
furthermore  if the company were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans at this time  it could trigger a withdrawal liability that would require the company to fund its proportionate share of a plan s unfunded vested benefits 
the company contributed  and to these plans for fiscal  and  respectively 
income taxes the company s current and deferred tax provision is based on estimates and assumptions that could materially differ from the actual results reflected in its income tax returns filed during the subsequent year and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
the company records adjustments based on filed returns when it has identified and finalized them  which is generally in a subsequent period 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse 
the company s effective tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
management s judgment is involved in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions 
in addition  the company is currently in various stages of audits  appeals or other methods of review with taxing authorities from various taxing jurisdictions 
the company establishes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in a variety of taxing jurisdictions when  despite management s belief that the company s tax return positions are supportable  certain positions may be challenged and may need to be revised 
unrecognized tax benefits are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
the effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to those reserves 
the company also provides interest on these liabilities at the appropriate statutory interest rate 
the actual benefits ultimately realized for tax positions may differ from the company s estimates due to changes in facts  circumstances and new information 
as of february  and february   the company had and of unrecognized tax benefits  respectively 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that it is more likely than not to realize 
forecasted earnings  future taxable income and future prudent and feasible tax planning strategies are considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company 
table of contents was not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  the valuation allowance would be increased 
likewise  if it was determined that the company was more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  the applicable portion of the valuation allowance would reverse 
the company had a valuation allowance of as of february  and february  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to the impact of deferred income taxes 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to the impact of the acquired operations on net earnings  depreciation and amortization and working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was  and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal and investing activities primarily reflect capital spending to fund retail store remodeling activity  new retail stores and technology expenditures 
fiscal investing activities primarily reflect the net assets acquired in the acquisition and capital spending to fund retail store remodeling and new stores 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was  and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal financing activities primarily reflect net payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations and payment of dividends 
fiscal financing activities primarily reflect net payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations  payment of dividends and purchases of treasury shares offset by proceeds received from the sale of common stock under the company s stock option plans 
fiscal financing activities primarily reflect the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition and senior notes issued in october  partially offset by repayment of long term debt of albertsons standalone drug business payables related to the sale of albertsons 
management expects that the company will continue to replenish operating assets with internally generated funds 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels 
the company will continue to obtain short term or long term financing from its credit facilities 
long term financing will be maintained through existing and new debt issuances 
maturities of debt issued will depend on management s views with respect to the relative attractiveness of interest rates at the time of issuance and other debt maturities 
although there can be no assurances in these difficult economic times for financial institutions  the company believes that the lenders participating in its credit facilities will be willing and able to provide financing to the company in accordance with their legal obligations under the credit facilities 
while the company s short term and long term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise  the current decline in the global financial markets may negatively impact the company s ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms 
while management believes that the company s cash flows and revolving credit facility will be more than sufficient to meet the company s financing needs through fiscal  the company is also evaluating appropriate timing for accessing the debt markets  which have shown recent improvement 
in addition  the company expects to renew its accounts receivable securitization program which expires in may certain of the company s credit facilities and long term debt agreements have restrictive covenants and cross default provisions which generally provide  subject to the company s right to cure  for the acceleration of payments due in the event of a breach of the covenant or a default in the payment of a specified amount of indebtedness due under certain other debt agreements 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants and provisions for all periods presented 
the company has senior secured credit facilities in the amount of  these facilities were provided by a group of lenders and consist of a  five year revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  a five year term loan term loan a and a  six year term loan term loan b

table of contents commitments  contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements the company has guaranteed certain leases  fixture financing loans and other debt obligations of various retailers as of february  these guarantees were generally made to support the business growth of independent retail customers 
the guarantees are generally for the entire terms of the leases or other debt obligations with remaining terms that range from less than one year to years  with a weighted average remaining term of approximately years 
for each guarantee issued  if the independent retail customer defaults on a payment  the company would be required to make payments under its guarantee 
generally  the guarantees are secured by indemnification agreements or personal guarantees of the independent retail customer 
the company reviews performance risk related to its guarantees of independent retail customers based on internal measures of credit performance 
as of february   the maximum amount of undiscounted payments the company would be required to make in the event of default of all guarantees was approximately and represented approximately on a discounted basis 
based on the indemnification agreements  personal guarantees and results of the reviews of performance risk  the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
accordingly  no amount has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheets for these contingent obligations under the company s guarantee arrangements 
the company is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions 
the company could be required to satisfy the obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations 
due to the wide distribution of the company s assignments among third parties  and various other remedies available  the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
the company is a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which the company may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters  which indemnities may be secured by operation of law or otherwise  in the ordinary course of business

while the company s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability  the company is aware of no current matter that it expects to result in a material liability 
the company is a party to various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business as described in part i  item  under the caption legal proceedings and in note commitments  contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements in the notes to consolidated financial statements  none of which  in management s opinion  is expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
pension plan health and welfare plan contingencies the company contributes to various multi employer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements  primarily defined benefit pension plans 
these plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
based on available information  the company believes that some of the multi employer plans to which it contributes are underfunded 
company contributions to these plans could increase in the near term 
however  the amount of any increase or decrease in contributions will depend on a variety of factors  including the results of the company s collective bargaining efforts  investment returns on the assets held in the plans  actions taken by the trustees who manage the plans and requirements under the pension protection act and section e of the internal revenue code 
furthermore  if the company were to significantly reduce contributions  exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans  it could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal that would require the company to fund its proportionate share of a plan s unfunded vested benefits 
the company also makes contributions to multi employer health and welfare plans in amounts set forth in the related collective bargaining agreements 
a small minority of collective bargaining agreements contain reserve requirements that may trigger unanticipated contributions resulting in increased healthcare expenses 
if these healthcare provisions cannot be renegotiated in a manner that reduces the prospective healthcare cost as the company intends  the company s selling and administrative expenses could increase in the future
