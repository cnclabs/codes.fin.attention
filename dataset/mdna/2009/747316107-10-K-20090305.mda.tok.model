our products  technical solutions  and chemical management services enhance our customers processes  improve their product quality  and lower their costs 
the revenue growth of in was largely due to selling price increases and favorable foreign exchange rate translation  as volume declines occurred in all the company s regions except china 
the majority of the volume decline occurred during the fourth quarter of  as the global economic downturn began to impact the company 
although higher selling prices helped to partially offset higher raw material costs  gross margin as a percentage of sales declined compared to the company s selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of sales declined to in  from in the decline in sg a as a percent of sales was largely reflective of higher sales  significantly lower incentive compensation cost and lower legal and environmental costs

in a further effort to reduce operating costs as volume declines continued in the us and europe and extended to other regions  quaker implemented an additional restructuring program in the first quarter of which is expected to include provisions for severance for approximately employees totaling approximately million to million 
as discussed in a current report on form k filed on february   the company has amended its credit facility to provide covenant relief related to the and restructuring programs and the ceo transition costs 
in addition  the amendment temporarily increases the maximum permitted leverage ratio from to during the period from june  to september   and to during the period from december  to march  in february  the company also amended two industrial revenue bonds totaling million to provide for the same changes in terms as the credit facility

the net result was earnings per diluted share of  down from for the dramatic volume declines in the fourth quarter resulted in a loss for that quarter  which negatively impacted an otherwise strong result for the first nine months of visibility of the underlying business activity remains limited due to an uncertain global economic environment  as further discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  raw material prices  which have remained at high levels despite recent declines in crude oil prices  have not been fully recovered through pricing actions 
any improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales will 
table of contents depend in part upon a sustained period of stable or declining raw material costs 
demand is expected to remain soft in the first half of due to the global economic environment and customer end market issues  particularly related to our steel and automotive customers 
the company will remain focused on pursuing revenue opportunities  managing its raw material costs and its cost reduction activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates quaker s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon quaker s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  quaker evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  investments  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  incentive compensation plans including equity based compensation  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
quaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and inventory reserves and exposures quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
further  a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel and automotive industries  where a number of bankruptcies have occurred during recent years and companies have experienced financial difficulties 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
these matters may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require write down or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
reserves for customers filing for bankruptcy protection are generally established at of the amount outstanding at the filing date  dependent on the company s evaluation of likely proceeds from the bankruptcy process 
large and or financially distressed customers are generally reserved for on a specific review basis while a general reserve is established for other customers based on historical experience 
the company s consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
further  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million and million in  and respectively 
an increase of to the recorded provisions would have decreased the company s pre tax earnings by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
environmental and litigation reserves accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted 
environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed  and or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future 
estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions  governmental regulations and other factors  and are subject to a large range of potential costs for remediation and other actions 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range  and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time 
similarly  reserves for litigation and 
table of contents similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome 
if no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount  the company accrues the lowest amount in the range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
an inactive subsidiary of the company is involved in asbestos litigation 
if the company ever concludes that it is probable it will be liable for any of the obligations of such subsidiary  then it will record the associated liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated 
the company will reassess this situation periodically in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
realizability of equity investments quaker holds equity investments in various foreign companies  whereby it has the ability to influence  but not control  the operations of the entity and its future results 
quaker records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments  or devaluation of foreign currencies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 
these factors may result in an impairment charge in the future 
the carrying amount of the company s equity investments at december  was million and was comprised of three investments totaling million  million and million  respectively 
tax exposures  valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be ultimately determined to be deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions 
the filed tax returns are subject to audit  often several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements 
disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions  which may not be resolved for extended periods of time 
quaker adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  fin applies to all income tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns or expected to be taken on a future tax return 
fin prescribes a benefit recognition model with a two step approach  a more likely than not recognition criterion  and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon effective settlement 
fin also requires that the amount of interest expense and income to be recognized related to uncertain tax positions be computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized in accordance with fin  including timing differences  and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
quaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while quaker has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
us income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries since it is the company s intention to continue to reinvest these earnings in those subsidiaries for working capital needs and growth initiatives 
us and foreign income taxes that would be payable if such earnings were distributed may be lower than the amount computed at the us statutory rate due to the availability of foreign tax credits 
restructuring liabilities restructuring charges may consist of charges for employee severance  rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other items 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets  which do not have indefinite lives  are recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the intangible asset based on third party valuations of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets  which have indefinite lives  are not amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
the company compares the assets fair value to their carrying value primarily based on future discounted cash flows in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
the company completed its annual impairment assessment as of the end of the third quarter  and no impairment charge was warranted 
the company s consolidated goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company s assumption of weighted average cost of capital and estimated future net operating profit after tax nopat are particularly important in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred 
the company currently uses a weighted average cost of capital of and  at september   this assumption would have had to increase by more than percentage points before any of the company s reporting units would fail step one of the sfas no 
impairment analysis 
further  at september   the company s estimate of future nopat would have had to decrease by more than before any of the company s reporting units would be considered potentially impaired 
given the downturn in general worldwide economic conditions  the company reevaluated its interim impairment testing at year end  which did not require any changes to the company s previous conclusion 
postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and other postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and  if necessary  non cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities 
critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if different assumptions were used  additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required

fsp clarifies the application of sfas  which the company adopted as of january   in cases where a market is not active 
the company has considered the guidance provided by fsp in its determination of estimated fair values as of december   and the impact was not material 
liquidity and capital resources quaker s cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  the million increase resulted primarily from million of cash provided by operating activities  million of cash provided by financing activities  offset in part by million of cash used in investing activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in  compared to million in lower net income and a net increase in working capital were the primary drivers for the decrease in cash flow from operations 
the million of cash flow from operations in was a near record level for the company 
the company remains focused on limiting the pace of its investment in working capital despite significant factors impacting the working capital accounts throughout the reduction in accounts receivable is reflective of the fourth quarter sales volume declines due to the global economic downturn 
this reduced business activity is also seen in a reduction in inventory with more than offsetting cash outflows in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
significantly reduced incentive compensation costs is the most significant factor other than reduced business activity affecting the accounts payable and other accrued liabilities comparison 
in  the company exceeded performance targets  while in  results were below target levels 
further  the company incurred significantly more stock based compensation in versus the prior year largely due to the previously announced retirement of the company s chief executive officer 
however  the change in cash inflows from increased stock based compensation was offset by the environmental charges  discussed below 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in  compared to million in the increased use of cash was primarily related to the restricted proceeds received from the company s second quarter bond offering related to the company s expansion of its middletown  ohio manufacturing facility 
capital expenditures were higher than the prior year primarily due to this project 
payments related to acquisitions in include the third of four annual payments of million related to the acquisition of the remaining interest in the company s brazilian joint venture and the third of four annual payments related to the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in its china joint venture for million 
also contributing to the change in cash flows from investing activities was a lower cash inflow from the company s below described restricted cash relating to asbestos costs of an inactive subsidiary of the company 
this net cash outflow is equally offset as a cash inflow in cash flows from operating activities  as the inactive subsidiary makes payments for claims and costs of defense in accordance with the settlement and release agreements 

table of contents in the first quarter of  an inactive subsidiary of the company reached a settlement agreement and release with one of its insurance carriers for million 
the proceeds of the settlement are restricted and can only be used to pay claims and costs of defense associated with this subsidiary s asbestos litigation 
the payments are structured to be received over a four year period with annual installments of million  the first of which was received in the second quarter of and the second of which was received in the first quarter of the subsequent installments are contingent upon whether or not federal asbestos legislation is adopted by the due date of each annual installment 
if federal asbestos legislation is so enacted  and requires the carrier to contribute into a trust or similar vehicle as a result of the policies issued to the subsidiary  then the insurance carrier s obligation to make the subsequent installments will be cancelled 
during the third quarter of  the same inactive subsidiary and one of its insurance carriers entered into a claim handling and funding agreement  under which the carrier will pay of the defense and indemnity costs incurred by or on behalf of the subsidiary in connection with asbestos bodily injury claims for a minimum of five years beginning july  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  compared to million of cash used in financing activities for a high level of cash received from stock option exercises as compared to the prior year impacted the change in cash flows from financing activities 
in addition  during the second quarter of  the company completed a million industrial revenue bond offering related to the expansion of its middletown  ohio manufacturing facility 
the proceeds of this bond are restricted and can only be used for capital expenditures related to the expansion 
the remaining change in cash flows from financing activities was due to lower debt repayments in as compared to financial markets around the globe have been experiencing extreme disruption  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
further  concerns over slower economic activity  inflation and deflation  increased energy costs  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending could lead to adverse business conditions for the company 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse global economic conditions 
reference is made to item a included in part i of this annual report 
while currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit lines and finance our operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies 
the company s primary credit line is a syndicated multicurrency credit agreement with bank of america  na administrative agent and certain other major financial institutions  which expires in the maximum principal amount available for revolving credit borrowings is million 
at december  and  the company had approximately million and million outstanding at a weighted average borrowing rate of and  respectively 
the company s access to this credit is largely dependent on its consolidated leverage ratio covenant  which cannot exceed to  at december   the consolidated leverage ratio was below to under this covenant the company could have borrowed an additional million at december  as discussed in a current report on form k filed on february  the company has amended its credit facility to provide covenant relief related to the and restructuring programs and the ceo transition costs 
in addition  the amendment temporarily increases the maximum permitted leverage ratio from to during the period from june  to september   and to during the period from december  to march  in february  the company also amended two industrial revenue bonds totaling million to provide for the same changes in terms as the credit facility 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps in order to fix a portion of its variable rate debt  with a combined notional value of million as of december  outstanding financial derivative instruments may expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
to manage credit risk  the company limits its exposure to any one counterparty 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 

table of contents the economic concerns noted above can affect our business in a number of ways including  but not limited to  those addressed in the following discussion 
the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of customers to obtain financing 
this has led certain customers to extend payment terms  which may directly impact our working capital investment and need for increased borrowings 
such events increase the company s exposure to concentration of credit risk  particularly in the automotive and steel industries 
in addition  the company believes demand for steel and automobiles is softening as a result of the reduced general level of economic activity 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also tend to exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur and may require write down or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets 
however  as a result of significant losses experienced in global equity markets  our pension funds experienced a million negative return for  which creates increased pension costs and contributions in at december   the company s gross fin liability  including accrued interest and penalties  was million 
the company cannot determine a reliable estimate of the timing of cash flows by period related to its fin liability 
however  should the entire fin liability be paid  the amount of the payment may be reduced by million as a result of offsetting benefits in other tax jurisdictions 
the company s net debt to total capital ratio remained strong at for both december  and  respectively 
the company believes it is capable of supporting its operating requirements  including pension plan contributions  capital expenditures and possible resolution of contingencies  through internally generated funds supplemented with debt as needed 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
pension and other postretirement plan contributions beyond are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets 
the timing of payments related to other long term liabilities  which consist primarily of deferred compensation agreements  cannot be readily determined due to their uncertainty 
interest obligations on the company s short and long term debt are included assuming the debt levels will be outstanding for the entire period and assuming the interest rates in effect at december  amounts in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total and beyond short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations pension and other postretirement plan contributions other long term liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents operations cms discussion in  the company began entering into new contracts under which it receives a set management fee and the costs that relate to those management fees were and are largely dependent on how well the company controls product costs and achieves product conversions from other third party suppliers to its own products 
this approach came with new risks and opportunities  as the profit earned from the management fee is subject to movements in product costs as well as the company s own performance 
the company believes this expanded approach is a way for quaker to become an integral part of our customers operational efforts to improve manufacturing costs and to demonstrate value that the company would not be able to demonstrate as purely a product provider 
consistent with the foregoing approach  the company has been awarded a series of multi year cms contracts  primarily at general motors powertrain  chrysler and ford manufacturing sites  since this business was an important step in building the company s share and leadership position in the automotive process fluids market and has positioned the company well for penetration of cms opportunities in other metalworking manufacturing sites 
this alternative approach had a dramatic impact on the company s revenue and margins 
under the traditional cms approach  where the company effectively acts as an agent  revenues and costs from these sales are reported on a net sales or pass through basis 
the alternative structure is different in that the company s revenue received from the customer is a fee for products and services provided to the customer  which are indirectly related to the actual costs incurred 
as a result  in the alternative structure the company recognizes in reported revenues the gross revenue received from the cms site customer  and in cost of goods sold the third party product purchases  which substantially offset each other until the company achieves significant product conversions 
as some contracts have been renewed or renegotiated  some of those contracts have reverted to a pass through basis  while others have remained on a gross basis 
currently  the company has a mix of contracts with both the traditional product pass through structure and fixed priced contracts covering all services and products 
the company s offerings will continue to include both approaches to cms  depending on customer requirements and business circumstances 
comparison of with net sales for were million  up from million for the increase in net sales was primarily due to selling price increases and foreign exchange rate translation partially offset by volume declines 
volumes were down approximately  while selling price increases were realized  in part  as a result of an ongoing effort to offset higher raw material costs 
the majority of the volume decline occurred during the fourth quarter of  with declines in all the company s regions as the global economic downturn began to impact the company 
foreign exchange rate translation increased revenues by approximately 
gross margin dollars were down approximately million  or  compared to the gross margin percentage of was also lower than the gross margin percentage of 
the decline in gross margin percentage was due to increased raw material costs partially offset by price increases  as well as product and regional sales mix 
sg a for decreased million compared to investments in higher growth areas  inflationary increases and unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation were more than offset by lower incentive compensation and lower legal and environmental costs 
in addition  during the third quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million related to a discontinued strategic initiative and a million charge related to certain customer bankruptcies 
in response to the dramatic volume declines in the us and europe and with the goal of reducing operating costs in those regions  the company implemented a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of  which eliminated more than positions and included provisions for severance for employees totaling million 
in a further effort to reduce operating costs as volume declines continued in the us and europe and extended to 
table of contents other regions  quaker implemented an additional restructuring program in the first quarter of which is expected to include provisions for severance for approximately employees totaling approximately million to million 
effective october   ronald j 
naples  chairman  retired as quaker s chief executive officer 
as further discussed in the company s k filed on may   the company is recognizing certain accelerated and other costs  in accordance with mr 
naples employment  transition and consulting agreement  which are expected to total million over the period 
incremental costs incurred in totaled million  or approximately per diluted share 
in  the company recorded environmental charges of million 
the charges consisted of million related to the settlement of environmental litigation involving ac products  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  as well as an additional million charge for the estimated remaining remediation costs 
the decrease in other income was primarily the result of foreign exchange losses recorded in  compared to gains in the prior year 
other income for also includes a net arbitration award of approximately million  or approximately per diluted share  related to litigation with one of the former owners of the company s italian subsidiary 
the decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower average borrowings and lower interest rates 
the company s effective tax rate was for  compared to in the prior year 
the effective tax rate was affected by a changing mix of income among jurisdictions  as well as the derecognition of several uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations for certain tax years  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement  no 
the effective tax rate for also includes an out of period non cash tax benefit adjustment of million related to the deferred tax accounting for the company s foreign pension plans and intangible assets regarding one of the company s acquisitions 
at the end of  the company had net us deferred tax assets totaling million  excluding deferred tax assets relating to additional minimum pension liabilities 
the company records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
however  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be a non cash charge to income in the period such determination was made  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
the continued price pressure in the company s raw materials  as well as the global economic downturn has been negatively impacting profitability in certain taxing jurisdictions 
the company continues to closely monitor this situation as it relates to its net deferred tax assets and the assessment of valuation allowances 
the company is continuing to evaluate alternatives that could positively impact taxable income in these jurisdictions 
segment reviews comparison of with metalworking process chemicals metalworking process chemicals consists of industrial process fluids for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications and represented approximately of the company s net sales in net sales were up million  or  compared to foreign currency translation positively impacted net sales by approximately  driven by the euro to us dollar  brazilian real to us dollar and chinese renminbi to us dollar exchange rates

the growth in sales was primarily attributable to higher sales prices implemented across all regions  in part  as a result of an ongoing effort to offset higher raw material costs 
the increased selling prices were offset in part by volume reductions in all regions except asia pacific 
the majority of the volume declines occurred in the fourth quarter of  as the global recession began to impact the company 
the million decrease in this segment s operating income compared to on a sales increase is reflective of the pace at which raw material costs have continued to increase  as well as the fourth quarter volume reductions 
this segment s operating income was also negatively impacted by lower quaker product sales due to lower customer production levels  higher selling costs  as well as cms profitability being negatively impacted by the american axle strike  which occurred earlier in coatings the company s coatings segment  which represented approximately of the company s net sales in  contains products that provide temporary and permanent coatings for metal and concrete products and chemical milling maskants

gross profit as a percentage of sales was for  as compared to for sg a for increased million compared to foreign exchange rate translation accounted for approximately million of the increase over the prior year 
also negatively affecting the comparison with the prior year was a pension gain of million recorded in the first quarter of  due to a legislative change 
the remainder of the increase was due to continued planned spending in higher growth areas  including china  higher incentive compensation as a result of higher earnings  higher commissions as a result of higher sales  higher legal and environmental costs  and inflationary increases 
in addition  during the third quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million related to a discontinued strategic initiative and a million charge related to certain customer bankruptcies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in commodity prices  and credit risk 

table of contents interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s debt is negotiated at market rates 
accordingly  if interest rates rise significantly  the cost of debt to quaker will increase 
this can have an adverse effect on quaker  depending on the extent of quaker s borrowings 
as of december   quaker had approximately million in borrowings under its credit facilities at a weighted average borrowing rate of approximately 
the company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for the purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps in order to fix a portion of its variable rate debt 
the swaps had a combined notional value of million and million and a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the counterparties to the swaps are major financial institutions 
outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
to manage credit risk  the company limits its exposure to any one counterparty 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
see the information included under the caption derivatives in note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report and is incorporated herein by reference 
in february  the company completed a refinancing of its existing industrial development bonds to fix the interest rate of an additional million of debt 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
these foreign operations also hold a significant portion of quaker s assets and liabilities 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of global business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real  the chinese renminbi and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially affected 
the company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions  however  the size of non us activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the attendant net assets 
during the past three years  sales by non us subsidiaries accounted for approximately to of consolidated net annual sales 
in addition  the company often sources inventory among its worldwide operations 
this practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location  as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances 
the company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts 
commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker s earnings can be materially affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to one year 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
credit risk 
quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel and automotive industries  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years and companies have experienced financial difficulty 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require write down or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory
