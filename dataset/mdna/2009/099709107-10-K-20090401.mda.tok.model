item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general borders group  inc  through our subsidiaries  borders  inc 
borders  walden book company  inc waldenbooks  and others individually and collectively  we  us or the company  is an operator of book  music and movie superstores and mall based bookstores 
at january   we operated superstores under the borders name  including in the united states and three in puerto rico 
we also operated mall based and other bookstores  including stores operated under the waldenbooks  borders express and borders outlet names  as well as borders branded airport stores 
in addition  we own and operate united kingdom based paperchase products limited paperchase  a designer and retailer of stationery  cards and gifts 
as of january   paperchase operated stores  primarily in the united kingdom  and paperchase shops have been added to domestic borders superstores 
in addition  we operate a proprietary e commerce web site  www 
borders 
com  which was launched in may on june   we sold bookstores that we had owned and operated in australia  new zealand and singapore 
on september   we sold bookstores that we had owned and operated in the uk and ireland 
the sale of these businesses is discussed below under the caption discontinued operations 
business strategy our business strategy is designed to address the most significant opportunities and challenges facing the company 
in particular  our challenges include maturity in our primary product categories  an extremely competitive marketplace including both store based and online competitors and product formats that are evolving from physical formats to digital formats 
these factors  among others  have contributed to declines in our comparable store sales measures and in our sales per square foot measures over the last several years 
these declines have  in turn  negatively impacted profitability 
the us book retailing industry is a mature industry  and growth has slowed in recent years 
books represent our primary product category in terms of sales 
rather than opening new book superstores  we believe that there is greater near term opportunity in improving the productivity of existing superstores and in enhancing internet based sales channels 
in particular  we see potential in combining the greater selection offered by internet retailing with the inviting atmosphere of a physical store 
we believe that web based retailing will continue to increase in popularity and market share as a distribution method for physical book  music  and movie merchandise 
in addition  the internet has enabled changes in the formats of many of the product categories we offer 
sales of music in the physical compact disc format  for example  have declined over the past several years  as consumers have increasingly turned to digital downloads of music 
this trend  which we expect to continue  is also beginning to manifest itself in the book and movie categories 
the shift toward digital formats represents an opportunity for us as we continue to strengthen our web based capabilities 
our physical stores  however  remain integral to our future success 
the environment in which our stores operate is intensely competitive and includes not only internet based retailers and book superstore operators  but also mass merchants and other non bookseller retailers 
because of this  the industry has experienced significant price competition over the last several years  which has decreased gross margin percentages for us and some competitors 
we anticipate that these trends will continue  rewarding those who can differentiate themselves by offering a distinctive customer experience  and who can operate efficiently 
therefore  we remain dedicated to the operational improvement of our stores and offering our customers a rich shopping experience in a relaxing  enjoyable atmosphere 
the principal components of our strategic plan are as follows grow comparable store sales and profitability in borders superstores 
we are focused on improving key retailing practices at our superstores in order to become the book store for the serious reader 
this includes increasing effectiveness of merchandise presentation  improving assortment planning  expense 
table of contents reduction initiatives replenishment and supply chain effectiveness  and ensuring consistency of execution across the chain 
a key element of this strategy is the enhancement of certain key categories  which will help to distinguish our domestic superstores from competitors 
these categories include children s  wellness  cooking  educational materials  seattle s best coffee cafes  and paperchase gifts stationery shops  which continue to be drivers of both sales and increased profitability for their categories 
to address declining sales in the music category  as well as increasing space available for improved merchandise presentation and expansion of higher margin categories  we have reduced music inventories and reallocated floor space in our stores 
in general  this has resulted in greater space being allocated to an expanded assortment of children s books and other growth categories within books  gifts and stationery and non book products such as teaching materials 
we plan to continue to reduce the space allocated to music during  as well as movie inventory  and continue to increase the space devoted to gifts and stationery and books 
also  we continue to develop our loyalty program  borders rewards  which has grown to approximately million members and continues to grow 
we will continue to focus on increasing the profitability of the program  on driving revenue through partnerships with other organizations  and increasing sales by employing customer data to tailor promotions that meet specific customer needs and interests 
as a result of our focus on existing stores and the need to preserve liquidity  we have effectively curtailed our new store program 
in addition  we continue to evaluate the performance of existing stores  and additional store closures could occur in cases where our store profitability goals are not met 
right size the waldenbooks specialty retail business 
the waldenbooks specialty retail segment has generally experienced negative comparable store sales percentages for the past several years  primarily due to an overall decrease in mall traffic  sluggish bestseller sales and increased competition from all channels 
although we expect that comparable store sales percentages will continue to decrease over the next few years  we believe that the company has the potential to operate mall based stores profitably 
an important element of this strategy is the signing of short term lease agreements for desirable locations  which enables us to negotiate rents that are responsive to the then current sales environment 
we will  however  continue to close stores that do not meet our profitability goals  a process which could result in additional future asset impairments and store closure costs 
we have recently increased the store profitability targets required for store lease renewals  which could also lead to increased numbers of asset impairments and store closures 
these measures are expected to improve profitability and free cash flow in the long term 
we will retain stable mall based locations that meet acceptable profit and return on investment objectives and in those stores  change product assortment and formats to drive sales and profitability 
leverage innovation  technology and strategic alliances to differentiate our business 
we will continue to drive sales to our recently launched web site  borders 
com  and continue our efforts to integrate the site with our physical stores 
borders 
com launched in may  and in store e commerce kiosks were introduced into borders stores during the fourth quarter of this strategy creates a distinctive  cross channel experience for customers  allows us to engage in key partnerships that are expected to build incremental revenues and margins  and enables the connection of e commerce sales to the borders rewards loyalty program 
borders 
com also provides us a platform for delivering digital content to customers  and we currently offer a limited selection of digital downloads 
in order to focus on our domestic business  we have suspended growth and investment in our international businesses 
we believe that the borders brand has global potential  and that future international growth  if pursued  will most profitably utilize a franchise business model  which we have applied successfully in malaysia and the united arab emirates 
we believe that fiscal will be challenging for retailers due to continued uncertainty in the economic environment  and as a consequence we will sharpen our focus on maximizing cash flow and profitability 
in addition  we will continue to review all cost structures with the goal of reducing expenses  and will continue 
table of contents to reduce working capital needs by further driving inventory productivity  thus improving cash flow and lowering supply chain costs 
driven by these factors  we expect to reduce expenses  including corporate  stores and distribution expenses  by million in compared to we anticipate that such cost and cash savings measures will improve both profitability and liquidity in as compared to  assuming that comparable store sales trends are consistent with those seen in however  we expect certain potential liquidity constraints in  which are discussed further in liquidity and capital resources

we also have an agreement with al maya group al maya  a diversified corporation headquartered in the united arab emirates  establishing a franchise agreement under which al maya or its affiliates operates borders stores in the united arab emirates and other gulf cooperation council gcc countries

taxes were not collected with respect to products sold on the web sites except in certain states 
as previously discussed  we launched our proprietary e commerce site during may  and the amazon agreements have been terminated subject to the survival of indemnification and certain other provisions

cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations increased million  or to million in from million in this was primarily due to cash provided by a decrease in inventories net of accounts payable in compared to cash used for an increase in inventories net of accounts payable in this change was driven by a reduction in the investment in music inventory in our superstores and the closure of underperforming mall stores in also contributing to the increase in operating cash flow was decreased cash used for taxes payable in as compared to  primarily due to variations in the adjustments to each year s pre tax loss for temporary and permanent differences  and a decreased operating loss in see discussion of our operating results under the caption results of operations 
partially offsetting these items was a lower increase in accrued payroll and other liabilities  primarily due to the timing of payments to employees  and lower non cash charges for depreciation and asset impairments and other writedowns in as compared to during fiscal we implemented an initiative to actively reduce inventory in our stores 
as a result  we significantly reduced inventories in the music category  as well as space allocated to that category 
in addition  we reduced inventories in the book and movie categories  in order to make our inventories more productive 
these two factors significantly contributed to the reduction in inventories compared to the same period last year 
we will continue to actively manage inventory levels throughout to drive inventory productivity and to maximize cash flows 
a key component of this strategy is our ability to maintain current payment terms and credit limits with our vendors 
we are involved in ongoing discussions with vendors on appropriate inventory levels  credit limits and other measures 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations was million in this was primarily the result of the cash proceeds of million received during from the sale of our australia  new zealand and singapore businesses 
these proceeds were partially offset by capital expenditures of million for new stores  new information technology systems including spending on our e commerce web site  and maintenance of existing stores  distribution centers and management information systems

capital expenditures we will reduce capital expenditures significantly in to approximately million  compared to million in capital spending in will be limited to a minimal number of new store openings  as well as maintenance spending on existing stores  distribution centers  and management information 
table of contents systems 
this will allow continued focus on improving the profitability of our existing stores and reduce our cash requirements 
dividends the board of directors has suspended the company s quarterly dividend program in order to preserve capital for operations and strategic initiatives 
sources of liquidity our most significant sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities and borrowings under the credit agreement 
borrowings typically peak in the fall as we build inventories in anticipation of the holiday selling season 
conversely  borrowings reach their lowest levels during december 
the credit agreement expires in july the credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to  million limited to and secured by eligible inventory and accounts receivable and related assets 
borrowings under the credit agreement are limited to a specified percentage of eligible inventories and accounts receivable and bear interest at a variable base rate plus the applicable increment or libor plus the applicable increment at our option 
eligible inventory is based upon the approximate liquidation value  as determined from time to time by an independent third party 
the credit agreement i includes a fixed charge coverage ratio requirement of to that is applicable only if outstanding borrowings under the facility exceed of maximum permitted borrowings thereunder  ii contains covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  consolidate or merge or dispose of assets  iii prohibits dividend payments and share repurchases that would result in borrowings under the facility exceeding of permitted borrowings thereunder  and iv contains default provisions that are typical for this type of financing  including a cross default provision relating to other indebtedness of more than million and a default provision should we receive a going concern qualification on our annual financial statements from our independent registered public accounting firm 
we had borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement of million  million and million at january   february  and february   respectively 
there was an additional million of borrowings outstanding related to our discontinued operations at february  at january   the additional funding available under the credit agreement was million 
this amount  however  is not necessarily indicative of our future funding capacity  due to the substantial fluctuation in this amount throughout the year and within a given month 
this amount varies not only in response to seasonal factors  such as the accumulation of inventory in advance of the holiday selling season  but also due to day to day operating factors  such as the timing of payments to vendors 
these factors  among others  can significantly impact the amount of funding available on any given day 
on april   we completed a financing agreement with pershing square  which was most recently amended on march  under the terms of the most recent amendment  pershing square has extended the maturity date of the term loan of million at a fixed interest rate of to april  this agreement contains covenants  restrictions and default provisions similar to those contained in the credit agreement described above 
as of january   we were in compliance with our financial and other covenants under the credit agreement 
we currently do not meet the credit agreement s fixed charge coverage ratio requirement 
this covenant is not currently applicable  however  because borrowings under the credit agreement have not exceeded of the maximum permitted borrowings 
we plan to operate our business and execute our strategic initiatives principally with funds generated from operations  financing through the credit agreement  credit provided by our vendors and other sources of new financing as deemed necessary and available 
as of the fourth quarter of  however  through our investigation of strategic alternatives  we have determined that the debt and equity capital markets are currently unavailable to us based on current market conditions 
our liquidity is impacted by a number of 
table of contents factors  including our sales levels  the amount of credit that our vendors extend to us and our borrowing capacity under the credit agreement 
we rely on vendor credit to finance approximately of our inventory calculated as trade accounts payable divided by merchandise inventories 
we are working closely with vendors to optimize inventory levels to improve our performance and to maintain acceptable levels of payables with our vendors 
in addition  the lenders under the credit agreement have the right to periodically obtain third party valuations of the liquidation value of our inventory  and the lowering of the liquidation value of our inventory reduces the amount that we are able to borrow under the credit agreement 
based on current internal sales projections  current vendor payable support and borrowing capacity  as well as other initiatives to maximize cash flow  we believe that we will have adequate capital to fund our operations during fiscal also in  we will continue to explore other financing alternatives with pershing square  and  if available  access other capital sources 
warrants our financing agreement with pershing square included the issuance of million warrants to purchase our common stock at per share  all of which are outstanding as of january  these warrants are required to be settled for cash in certain circumstances  including the sale of the company to a non publicly held entity or the de listing of our common stock from trading on the nyse 
we estimate the fair value of this cash settlement liability to be million as of january   based upon a black scholes valuation  and have recorded this liability as a component of other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
the black scholes valuation model takes into account several inputs  one of which is our share price 
fluctuations in our share price may have a material impact on this liability and the cash required to settle this liability  thus impacting our liquidity 
ignoring changes in all other factors  an increase in our share price would result in an increase in the liability and an increase in the potential cash exposure 
during  we recognized million of non cash income related to the re measurement of this liability 
as a result of the march  amendment of our financing agreement with pershing square  the exercise price of the million warrants outstanding was reduced to per share  through the operation of the antidilution provisions of the warrants 
as a result of the reduction in the exercise price of the warrants  we expect the liability  and potential cash exposure  to increase to approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements at january   we were the primary beneficiary of two variable interest entities vies  due to our guarantee of the debt of these entities 
these entities were established by third party developers to own  construct  and lease two of our store locations 
to refinance the debt associated with the construction of these stores  we were required to guarantee the debt of these two entities 
as a result  we consolidate these vies and have recorded property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  of million  long term debt including current portion of million and minority interest of million at january  the existence of these vies does not significantly impact our liquidity  capital resources or market risk support  or confer significant benefits to us 
as discussed previously  we guarantee the leases of four stores that we previously owned in australia and new zealand 
these guarantees were required by certain of our landlords as conditions of the leases upon inception  and were not impacted by our disposition of our australian and new zealand operations 
the maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees undiscounted is approximately million 
we have recorded a contingent liability of approximately million based upon the likelihood that we will be required to perform under the guarantees 
also under the terms of the sale agreement  we provided certain tax indemnifications to the purchasers  with the maximum amount of potential future payments undiscounted totaling approximately million 
we previously reserved for this item 
we also guarantee the leases of four stores that we previously owned in the uk and ireland 
these guarantees were required by certain of our landlords as conditions of the leases upon inception  and were unrelated to our disposition of operations in the uk and ireland 
the maximum potential liability under 
table of contents these lease guarantees is approximately million 
the leases provide for periodic rent reviews  which could increase our potential liability 
one of the applicable lease guarantee agreements provides that the guarantee will automatically terminate if borders uk limited achieves a specified level of net assets 
this potential limitation has not been considered in calculating the maximum exposures set forth above 
in addition  in the event of a default under the primary leases and the landlord does not require us to take a new replacement lease  the landlord would have an obligation to attempt to re lease the premises  which could further reduce our potential liability 
at january   we have reserved million based upon the likelihood that we will be required to perform under these guarantees 
we also have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of the uk and ireland operations from the tax liability  if any  imposed upon it as a result of the forgiveness of the portions of intercompany indebtedness owing from us 
the maximum potential liability is approximately million  and we have recorded a liability of approximately million based upon the likelihood that we will be required to perform under the indemnification 
the various guarantees and indemnifications related to our australian  new zealand  uk  and ireland businesses are not currently expected to significantly impact our liquidity  capital resources or market risk support  or confer significant benefits to us 
if  however  we are required to perform under these obligations  there is the potential for a significant adverse impact on our liquidity 
significant contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at january   excluding interest expense fiscal year and dollars in millions thereafter total credit agreement borrowings term loan borrowings operating lease obligations capital lease obligations debt of consolidated vies letters of credit other borrowings total subsequent to year end  the maturity date of the term loan was extended to april  the table above excludes any amounts related to the payment of uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the periods of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
excluding interest and penalties  these uncertain tax positions total million at january  the table above excludes any amounts related to required interest payments on the credit agreement  which are expected to range from million to million in fiscal this range was developed using the interest rate in effect at january  and utilized estimates of the amount and timing of borrowings and payments 
currently  we are required to pay interest on credit agreement borrowings when various short term tranches mature 
at any given time we have multiple outstanding tranches with various principal amounts  interest rates and maturity dates 
due to these factors  as well as the uncertainty of future borrowing amounts and rates  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the cash required to pay interest on credit agreement borrowings in years beyond fiscal we paid million and million of interest on credit agreement borrowings in fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents the table above also excludes any amounts related to taxes  insurance and other charges payable under operating lease agreements  which are expected to range from million to million in fiscal this range was based on the historical trend of these expenses  as adjusted for store activity 
because of the future variability of these amounts  which are dependent on future store count and ongoing negotiations with our landlords  among other things  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate in years beyond fiscal we paid million and million related to these expenses in fiscal and  respectively 
seasonality the company s business is highly seasonal  with sales significantly higher during the fourth quarter  which includes the holiday selling season 
fiscal dollars in millions q q q q sales operating income loss of full year sales fiscal dollars in millions q q q q sales operating income loss of full year sales critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies and estimates 
long lived assets the carrying value of long lived assets is evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in performing such reviews for recoverability  we compare the assets undiscounted expected future cash flows to their carrying values 
if the expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value 
expected future cash flows  which are estimated over the assets remaining useful lives  contain estimates of sales and the impact those future sales will have upon cash flows 
future sales are estimated based  in part  upon a projection of each store s sales trend based on the actual sales of the past several years 
additionally  each store s future cash contribution is based upon the most recent year s actual cash contribution  but is adjusted based upon projected trends in sales and store operating costs 
fair value is estimated using expected discounted future cash flows 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate long lived asset impairment losses during the past three years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use in the future 
however  if actual 
table of contents results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  material additional asset impairment losses could occur 
inventory reserves the carrying value of our inventory is affected by reserves for shrinkage ie  physical loss due to theft  etc 
and markdowns 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies used to establish these reserves during the past three years 
our shrinkage reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the last physical inventory date 
physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the inventory reported in our financial statements is properly stated 
during the interim period between physical inventory counts  we reserve for anticipated losses on a location by location basis 
shrinkage estimates are typically based upon our most recent experience of losses for each particular location 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve 
however  if our estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in actual shrinkage reserved for at january  would have affected net income by approximately million in our reserve for the markdown of inventories below cost is based on our estimates of inventory aging  customer demand  and the promotional environment 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown reserve 
however  if our estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our actual markdown reserve at january  would have affected net income by approximately million in costs associated with exit activities we occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease 
for vacated locations that are under long term leases  we record a liability for the difference between our future lease payments and related costs from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term  net of expected sublease rental income 
this liability contains estimates of the amount and duration of potential sublease rental income  which are based upon historical experience and knowledge of the relevant real estate markets 
we have not made any material changes in our accounting methodology used to establish this reserve during the past three years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use in the future 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our reserve at january  would have affected net income by approximately million in self insured liabilities we are self insured for certain losses related to health  workers compensation and general liability claims 
however  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims 
our self insured liabilities contains estimates  based in part upon historical experience  of the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date 
we have not made any material changes in our accounting methodologies used to establish these reserves during the past three years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use in the future 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our reserve at january  would have affected net income by approximately million in liabilities for lease guarantees of disposed foreign businesses we guarantee eight store leases relating to former subsidiaries in the united kingdom  ireland  australia and new zealand 
our liabilities for these guarantees contain estimates of the likelihood that we would be 
table of contents required to perform under the guarantees  changes in anticipated rental amounts  and the amount and duration of potential sublease rental income 
we have not made any material changes in our accounting methodology used to establish these reserves during the past three years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use in the future 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
gift cards we sell gift cards to our customers and record a liability for the face value of all cards issued and unredeemed within the last months 
for cards older than months  we record a liability for a portion of the cards face value based upon historical redemption trends 
this methodology has been materially consistent during the past three years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our gift card liability 
however  if our estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our unredeemed gift card breakage rate at january  would have affected net income by approximately million in income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes will be due 
these liabilities are calculated in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
we recognize the tax effects of a position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the more likely than not threshold represents a positive assertion by management that a company is entitled to the economic benefits of a tax position 
if a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits  no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
moreover  the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audit controversies or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the assets will not be realized 
during  we recorded a non cash charge related to establishing a full valuation allowance against our domestic net deferred tax assets 
the year end valuation allowance charge was million  and was calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
fas requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if  in the future  we realize domestic taxable income on a sustained basis of the appropriate character and within the net operating loss carry forward period  we would be allowed to reverse some or all of this valuation allowance  resulting in an income tax benefit 
further  changes in existing tax laws could also affect valuation allowance needs in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to these risks is managed though a combination of normal operating and financing activities  which may include the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
interest rate risk we are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  as interest on certain of our borrowings is based on variable rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
historically  we had utilized interest rate swaps to achieve this objective  effectively converting a portion of our variable rate exposure to fixed interest rates 
currently  we have no such agreements in effect 
libor is the rate upon which our variable rate debt is principally based 
if libor were to increase for the full year of as compared to  our after tax losses would increase approximately million based on our outstanding debt as of january  foreign currency exchange risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange exposure for operations with assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
on a normal basis  we do not attempt to hedge the foreign currency translation fluctuations in the net investments in its foreign subsidiaries 
we do  from time to time  enter into short term forward exchange contracts to sell or purchase foreign currencies at specified rates based on estimated foreign currency cash flows 
it is our policy not to purchase financial and or derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
at january   we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
