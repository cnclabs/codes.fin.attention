preliminary note regarding forward looking statements the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements set forth commencing on page f of this report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that relate to future events and expectations and  as such  constitute forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include those containing such words as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  hopes  targets  should  will  will likely result  forecast  outlook  projects or similar expressions 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
company overview we were incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada and  along with our wholly owned subsidiaries  are headquartered in harbin  china 
we design  develop  manufacture  supply  and service a wide range of electric motors  with a focus on innovation  creativity  and value added products 
our major product lines include linear motors  specialty micro motors  and industrial rotary motors 
our products are purchased by a broad range of customers including those customers in the oil services  factory automation  food processing  packaging industries  mass transportation systems  petrochemical  metallurgical  mining  textile  and agricultural industries 
we sell our products principally in china  but also internationally in north america  and to a lesser degree in southeast asia and africa 
we are subject to risks common to companies operating in china  including risks inherent in our distribution and commercialization efforts  uncertainty of foreign regulatory and marketing approvals and laws  reliance on key customers  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital and retention of key employees 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
our critical accounting policies and estimates present an analysis of the uncertainties involved in applying a principle  while the accounting policies note to the financial statements note describe the method used to apply the accounting principle 
accounts receivable we use estimates in determining our allowance for bad debts that are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs in our receivables 
in determining the appropriate reserve percentages  we also review current trends in the credit quality of our customers  as well as changes in our internal credit policies 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable 
management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves 
reserves are recorded primarily on a specific identification basis 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than anticipated  or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable  known bad debts are written off against allowance for doubtful accounts when identified 
inventories inventory levels are based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
inventories are stated at cost  not in excess of market using the weighted average cost method 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can result in excess and or obsolete inventories 
because most of our products are customized and unique to a particular customer  there is a risk that we will forecast inventory needs incorrectly and purchase or produce excess inventory 
as a result  actual demand may differ from forecasts  and such differences  if not managed  may have a material adverse effect on future results of operations due to required write offs of excess or obsolete inventory 
to mitigate such exposure  we require a binding purchase order or a signed agreement by our customer agreeing to pay for and take possession of finished goods inventory parts for the duration of the agreement 
on an ongoing basis  inventories are reviewed for potential write down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the costs of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon forecasts for future demand and market conditions 
to the extent we increase our reserves for future periods  operating income will be reduced 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies comply with staff accounting bulletin sab and sfas sab requires that revenue can only be recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue generally is realized or realizable and earned when all four of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for products that are required to be examined by customers upon receiving shipments  sales revenue is recognized after the customer examination is passed 
in addition  our revenue recognition could be negatively impacted by returns 
for our linear motor and specialty micro motor businesses  our products are custom products which are customer specific  and no returns are allowed 
we warrant our product for repair  only in the event of defects for two years from the date of shipment 
we charge such costs to cost of goods sold 
for our newly acquired rotary motor business  our products are standardized products and returns are allowed within three days upon receipt of products by customers 
we provide product warranty for repair one year from the date of shipment 
historically  the returns and defects have not been material 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
the company uses the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of earnings 
derivative financial instruments the company uses a cross currency interest rate swap to hedge its exposure under the notes 
the derivative is initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and subsequently re measured at fair value each reporting period 
changes in the fair values of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges  to the extent they qualify for hedge accounting  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes  changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments not qualifying as hedges are reported in income 
at the inception of a hedge transaction  the company documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes linking all derivatives designated to specific firm commitments of forecast transactions 
the company also documents its assessment  both at inception and on an ongoing basis  of whether the derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items

executive summary the company s operating results for reflect two distinct economic periods 
during the first three quarters  business conditions were solid 
we achieved results that met or  in some areas  exceeded our expectations 
beginning with the fourth quarter  global economic activity contracted significantly  negatively impacting our businesses beginning in november 
while we saw significant demand growth from our major international customers in the fourth quarter  this was more than offset by softer demand from our domestic customers  particularly in the rotary motor and automobile specialty micro motor businesses  and the seasonality of oil pump sales 
the combined net negative effect resulted in fourth quarter sales dropping below third quarter levels 
the start up of our shanghai facility partially was delayed as our customers reacted with great caution to the global financial crisis 
despite these severe  unfavorable fourth quarter business conditions  the company posted an sales increase in to million  and generated a record million net income and million cash from operations 
excluding the acquisition of hengda  sales increased by and net income was at a record million 
our strong results for testify to our strategic vision over the past years and reflect the resilience of our business model 
as we begin  we continue to experience soft demand in some areas but see some signs of demand improvement in other parts of our business 
for  we expect that our linear motors for subway train cars  the start up of the shanghai facility  and volume growth in oil pumps as well as the government s stimulus package  will drive sales and earnings growth over  although  at a currently hard to judge growth rate 
we expect that these positive factors will begin to impact our business in the second half of the year 
in these uncertain times and facing possible further deterioration in global economic conditions  our priority in managing our business through this economic meltdown is to retain our existing business and customers while continue to pursue growth opportunities

changes in raw materials pricing did not have a material impact on our gross margins in either or the overall gross profit margin is expected to decline gradually as the sales of our lower margin automobile micro motors is expected to increase  due to its expected faster growth than linear motors in the next few years 
additionally  we expect that the overall gross profit margin is likely to be impacted due to the business expansion and broadened product offerings driven by our multifaceted growth strategies 
our long term objective is to maintain gross profit margins above the respective industry averages 
we are confident that our technology focus and our product development capabilities will allow us to stay competitive long term

research and development costs were million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in  representing a decrease year over year 
the higher spending on r d in was primarily due to the initiation of many new projects including the joint research and development project with the institute of electrical engineering of the chinese academy of sciences ieecas to produce an urban mass transportation train system driven by linear motors 
as we are a technology oriented manufacturer focusing on innovation and creativity  investing in research and development is an important part of our business strategy

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to a variety of global market risks  including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these exposures are managed  in part  with the use of a financial derivative 
the company uses financial derivatives only to hedge exposures in the ordinary course of business and does not invest in derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign exchange risk we currently conduct substantially all of our operations through our prc subsidiaries 
the functional currency of our prc subsidiaries is the chinese rmb 
the financial statements of our chinese subsidiary are translated to united states dollars using year end exchange rates as to assets and liabilities and average exchange rates as to revenues  expenses  and cash flows 
capital accounts are translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transaction occurred 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity 
transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred 
as the majority of our net revenue  of consolidated costs and expenses  and substantially all of our assets are denominated in rmb  any significant revaluation of the rmb may materially and adversely affect our cash flows  revenues and financial condition 
for example  if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues  earnings  and assets  as expressed in our us dollar financial statements could decline 
in addition  if we decide to convert our rmb into us dollars for the purpose of making payments for business purposes  the us dollar equivalent of the rmb we convert would be reduced 
on the other hand  to the extent that we need to convert us dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into rmb for our operations  appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar could reduce the amount of the us dollars available 
in addition  the appreciation of the rmb could make our customers products more expensive to purchase  because some of our customers are involved in the export of goods  which may have an adverse impact on their sales 
a decrease in sales by our customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
the local currencies in the countries in which we sell our products may fluctuate in value in relation to other currencies 
such fluctuations may affect the costs of our products sold and the value of our local currency profits 
while we are not conducting any meaningful operations in countries other than china at the present time  we may expand to other countries and may then have an increased risk of exposure of our business to currency fluctuation 
the prc government imposes control over the conversion of rmb  into foreign currencies 
under the current unified floating exchange rate system  the people s bank of china publishes an exchange rate  which we refer to as the pboc exchange rate  based on the previous day s dealings in the inter bank foreign exchange market 
financial institutions authorized to deal in foreign currency may enter into foreign exchange transactions at exchange rates within an authorized range above or below the pboc exchange rate according to market conditions 
pursuant to the foreign exchange control regulations of the prc issued by the state council which came into effect on april   and the regulations on the administration of foreign exchange settlement  sale and payment of the prc which came into effect on july   regarding foreign exchange control  conversion of rmb into foreign exchange by foreign investment enterprises  or fies  for use on current account items  including the distribution of dividends and profits to foreign investors  is permissible 
fies are permitted to convert their after tax dividends and profits to foreign exchange and remit such foreign exchange to their foreign exchange bank accounts in china 
conversion of rmb into foreign currencies for capital account items  including direct investment  loans  and security investment  is still under certain restrictions 
on january   the state council amended the foreign exchange control regulations and added  among other things  an important provision  which provides that the prc government shall not impose restrictions on recurring international payments and transfers under current account items 
enterprises in china  including fies  which require foreign exchange for transactions relating to current account items  if within a certain limited amount may  without approval of the state administration of foreign exchange  or safe  effect payment from their foreign exchange account or convert and pay at the designated foreign exchange banks by providing valid receipts and proofs 
convertibility of foreign exchange in respect of capital account items  such as direct investment and capital contribution  is still subject to certain restrictions  and prior approval from the safe or its relevant branches must be sought 
between and  the exchange rate for rmb against the us dollar remained relatively stable  most of the time in the region of approximately rmb to us 
however  in  the chinese government announced that it would begin pegging the exchange rate of the rmb against a number of currencies  rather than just the us dollar 
since a significant amount of our future revenues are expected to be denominated in rmb  any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in china to fund our business activities outside of china  if any  or expenditures denominated in foreign currencies  or our ability to meet our foreign currency obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that the prc regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of rmb with respect to foreign exchange transactions 
we recognized a foreign currency translation adjustment of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the balance sheet amounts with the exception of equity at december  were translated at rmb to usd as compared to rmb at december  the equity accounts were stated at their historical rate 
the average translation rates applied to the income and cash flow statement amounts for the years ended december  and were rmb and rmb to usd  respectively 
other than with respect to the notes  we do not hedge our exposure to foreign exchange risk  as such  we may in the future experience economic loss as a result of any foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the notes and notes  as described under liquidity and capital resources 
our future interest expense will fluctuate in line with any change in our borrowing rates and therefore affect our cash flows and results of operations 
derivative instrument to mitigate our exposure to volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates fluctuation associated with the notes  in  the company entered a cross currency interest rate swap agreement  as described under liquidity and capital resources cross currency interest rate hedge 
inflation according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the change in consumer price index in china was  and in  and  respectively 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operations in recent years 
concentration of credit risks the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents  for cash flow statement purposes 
cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with state owned banks within the prc and the united states 
certain financial instruments  which subject the company to concentration of credit risk  consist of cash 
the company maintains balances at financial institutions which  from time to time  may exceed federal deposit insurance corporation insured limits for the banks located in the unites states 
balances at financial institutions or state owned banks within the prc are not covered by insurance 
as of december  and  the company had deposits in excess of federally insured limits totaling  and  respectively 
the company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts

because of our dependence on a few key customers  the loss of any key customer  or a significant reduction in sales to any such customers  or any failure of payment by these customers could adversely affect our revenues 
we depend on a few key suppliers to provide the raw materials and key component parts for the manufacture of our products 
and adverse changes in such supply or the costs of raw materials may adversely affect our operations 
in addition  if we need alternative sources for key component parts for any reason  these component parts may not be immediately available to us 
if alternative suppliers are not immediately available  we will have to identify and qualify alternative suppliers  and production of these components may be delayed 
we may not be able to find an adequate alternative supplier in a reasonable time period  or on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
shipments of affected products have been limited or delayed as a result of such problems in the past  and similar problems could occur in the future 
our inability to obtain our key source supplies for the manufacture of our products may require us to delay shipments of products  harm customer relationships or force us to curtail or cease operations
