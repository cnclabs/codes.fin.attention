item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below for a discussion of the amount of the company s net sales contributed by product categories 
industry overview the distribution channels for specialty technology products generally consist of manufacturers  wholesale distributors such as scansource  resellers and end users 
the sales channel for specialty technology products typically evolves through a three stage process i direct sales by manufacturers to end users  ii single tier distribution in which manufacturers sell to resellers who  in turn  sell directly to end users  and iii two tier  or wholesale distribution  in which manufacturers sell to wholesale distributors  including scansource  who sell only to resellers who  in turn  sell directly to end users 

table of contents 
index to financial statements currently  the technology products wholesale distribution channel is served by both broadline and specialty distributors 
the broadline distributors are engaged primarily in conventional order fulfillment and typically offer their reseller customers less support and fewer value added services than do specialty distributors 
the specialty distributors that compete with scansource are generally smaller  both in terms of size and geographic area covered 
competition among an expanding number of manufacturers typically causes product prices to decrease and product applications to expand  which has resulted in an increasing number of resellers entering the market in order to support a broader base of potential end users 
as the number of resellers and end users has grown  competition among manufacturers and within the reseller channel has intensified 
because many specialty technology manufacturers develop products that represent only one part of a total solution  most products eventually are developed to provide interoperability among products from multiple manufacturers 
as a result of interoperability  a variety of manufacturers products are typically configured together to create a system solution 
therefore  both manufacturers and resellers have become more dependent upon value added wholesale distributors such as scansource for the aggregation of products and reseller support services  as well as the organization and maintenance of an efficient market structure 
in addition  manufacturers that face declining product prices and rising costs of direct sales increasingly rely upon value added wholesale distributors by outsourcing certain support functions  such as product assortment  delivery  inventory management  technical assistance  and marketing 
at the same time  shortened product life cycles and the introduction of new products and applications have caused resellers increasingly to rely on wholesale distributors for various inventory management  financing  technical support and related functions 
the company believes that as the reseller market grows and becomes more fragmented  and as specialty technology products continue to transition to open systems  the wholesale distribution channel in which the company operates will become increasingly more important 
vendors the company s key vendors for its scansource pos and barcoding sales unit are cisco  datalogic  elo  epson america  honeywell  ibm  intermec  motorola  ncr  and zebra technologies 
the company s key vendors in its catalyst telecom sales unit are avaya  extreme networks  juniper networks  plantronics and polycom 
the company s key vendors for its scansource communications sales unit are audiocodes  dialogic  plantronics  and polycom 
the company s key vendors for its scansource security sales unit are axis  sony  and zebra card 
of all of the company s vendors  only two  motorola and avaya  each constitute more than of the company s net sales 
the company has over vendors that currently supply its products 
the company s products are typically purchased directly from the manufacturer on a non exclusive basis 
the company s agreements with its vendors generally do not restrict the company from selling similar or comparable products manufactured by competitors 
the company has the flexibility to terminate or curtail sales of one product line in favor of another due to technological change  pricing considerations  product availability  customer demand  or vendor distribution policies 
the company has written distribution agreements with its key vendors and with almost all of its vendors 
the company s written distribution agreements are in the form that it believes are customarily used by manufacturers and distributors 
the company s agreements generally provide it with non exclusive distribution rights and often include territorial restrictions that limit the countries in which the company can distribute its products 
these agreements typically provide the company with stock rotation and price protection provisions 
stock rotation rights give the company the ability  subject to certain limitations  to return for credit or exchange a portion of those inventory items purchased from the vendor 
price protection situations occur when a vendor 
table of contents 
index to financial statements credits the company for declines in inventory value resulting from the vendor s price reductions 
along with the company s inventory management policies and practices  these provisions are designed to reduce the company s risk of loss due to slow moving inventory  vendor price reductions  product updates or obsolescence 
some of the company s distribution agreements contain minimum purchase requirements that the company must meet in order to receive preferential prices 
the company participates in various rebate  cash discount and cooperative marketing programs offered by its vendors to support expenses associated with distributing and marketing the vendor s products 
the rebates and purchase discounts are generally influenced by sales volumes and are subject to change 
the company s distribution agreements are generally short term  subject to periodic renewal  and provide for termination by either party without cause upon to days notice 
the company s vendors generally warrant the products the company distributes and allow returns of defective products  including those returned to the company by its customers 
the company generally does not independently warrant the products it distributes  however  local laws may in some cases impose warranty obligations on the company 
the company s merchandising department recruits vendors and manages important aspects of its vendor relationships  such as purchasing arrangements  cooperative marketing initiatives  vendor sales force relationships  product training  monitoring of rebate programs and various contract terms and conditions 
customers the company s reseller customers currently include over  active value added reseller accounts vars located in the united states  canada  mexico  latin america and europe 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s total net sales for the fiscal year ended june  the company generally targets two types of reseller customers specialty technology vars these resellers focus on selling specialty technology products as tailored software or integrated hardware solutions for their end users existing applications or incorporating specialty technology products into customized technology solutions for their end users 
primary industries served by these resellers include manufacturing  distribution  health care  pharmaceutical  hospitality  government  convenience  grocery  financial  and other retail markets 
networking or pc vars these resellers develop computer solutions and networking for their end users microcomputer needs 
they typically have well established relationships with end user management information system directors and are seeking additional revenue and profit opportunities in related technology markets  such as aidc  pos  security  or communications 
sales and electronic commerce the company s sales department consists primarily of inside sales representatives located in the united states  canada  mexico  belgium  france  germany  the united kingdom  and the netherlands 
in order to build strong customer relationships  most active resellers are assigned to a sales representative 
each sales representative negotiates pricing directly with their assigned customers 
the company also employs business development representatives who are responsible for developing technical expertise within broad product markets  recruiting customers  creating demand  and reviewing overall product and service requirements of resellers 
each sales representative and business development representative receives comprehensive training with respect to the technical characteristics of each vendor s products 
this training is supplemented by frequent product seminars conducted by vendors representatives and bi weekly meetings among product  marketing and sales managers 

table of contents 
index to financial statements increasingly  customers rely upon the company s electronic ordering and information systems  in addition to its product catalogs and frequent mailings  as sources for product information  including availability and price 
through the company s website  most customers can gain remote access to the company s information systems to check real time product availability  see their customized pricing and place orders 
customers can also follow the status of their orders and obtain united parcel service ups and federal express fedex package tracking numbers from this site 
marketing the company provides a range of marketing services  including cooperative advertising with vendors through trade publications and direct mail  product catalogs for each of the north american  european and latin american markets  periodic newsletters  management of sales leads  trade shows with hardware and software companies and vendors  direct mail  and sales promotions 
in addition  the company organizes and operates its own seminars teaming with top vendors to recruit prospective resellers and introduce new applications for the specialty technology products it distributes 
the company frequently customizes its marketing services for vendors and resellers 
value added services in addition to the basic order fulfillment and credit services that conventional wholesale distributors typically provide to resellers  the company differentiates itself by providing an array of value added services and business tools that assist resellers to provide more complete solutions and improve customer service 
such services include custom configuration  professional services  technical support  partner marketing  web storefronts  custom packaging  and other specialized services 
operations information system the company s information system is a scalable  centralized processing system capable of supporting numerous operational functions including purchasing  receiving  order processing  shipping  inventory management and accounting 
sales representatives rely on the information system for on line  real time information on product pricing  inventory availability and reservation  and order status 
the company s warehouse operations use bar code technology for receiving and shipping  and automated ups and fedex systems for freight processing and shipment tracking  each of which is integrated with the company s information system 
the customer service and technical support departments employ the system for documentation and faster processing of customer product returns 
to ensure that adequate inventory levels are maintained  the company s buyers depend on the system s purchasing and receiving functions to track inventory on a continual basis 
central warehouse and shipping the company operates a  square foot distribution center in southaven  mississippi  which is located near the fedex hub facility in memphis  tennessee and serves all of north america 
the company utilizes a third party warehouse located in liege  belgium that serves all of europe  including the united kingdom 
the company has additional warehouse facilities in florida and mexico  which serve latin america including mexico 
the company believes that its centralized distribution creates several advantages  including i a reduced amount of safety stock inventory which  in turn  reduces the company s working capital requirements  ii an increased turnover rate through tighter controls over inventory  iii maintenance of a consistent order fill rate  iv improved personnel productivity  v improved delivery time  vi simplified purchasing and tracking  vii decreased demand for management personnel  and viii flexibility to meet customer needs for systems integration 
the company s objective is to ship all orders on the same day  using bar code technology to expedite shipments and minimize shipping errors 
the company offers reduced freight rates and flexible delivery options to minimize a reseller s need for inventory 

table of contents 
index to financial statements financial services the company routinely offers competitive credit terms relative to the specific geographic area for qualified resellers and facilitates various third party financing options  including leasing  flooring  and other secured financing 
the company believes this policy reduces the customer s need to establish multiple credit relationships with a large number of manufacturers 
competition the markets in which the company operates  as identified above  are highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on factors such as price  product availability  speed and accuracy of delivery  effectiveness of sales and marketing programs  credit availability  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality and breadth of product lines and services  and availability of technical and product information 
in the scansource pos and barcoding sales unit  the company competes with broad line distributors such as avnet  ingram micro  synnex and tech data  in all geographic segments 
additionally  the company also competes against other smaller  more specialized  aidc and pos distributors  such as bluestar 
in the catalyst telecom sales unit  the company competes against ingram micro  jenne  tech data  and voda one 
in the scansource communications sales unit based in north america and in europe  the company competes against ingram micro  nimans  tech data  and westcon 
in the scansource security sales unit  which is based in north america  the company competes against other broad line distributors such as adi  synnex  and tech data and more specialized distributors such as anixter  northern video systems  and tri ed 
as the company seeks to expand its business into other areas closely related to the company s offerings  the company may encounter increased competition from current competitors and or from new competitors  some of which may be the company s current customers 
the company s competitors include regional and national wholesale distributors  as well as hardware manufacturers including most of the company s vendors that sell directly to resellers and to end users 
in addition  the company competes with master resellers that sell to franchisees  third party dealers and end users 
certain of the company s current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company has and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
certain smaller regional competitors  who are specialty two tier or mixed model master resellers  may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition has increased for our sales units over the last several years as broad line and other value added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets 
such competition could also result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share by the company 
employees as of june   the company had  employees located in north america  latin america including mexico and europe 
only employees located in mexico are considered to be a collective bargaining unit 
the company considers its employee relations to be good 
service marks the company conducts its business under the trademarks and service marks scansource pos and barcode  catalyst telecom  scansource communications  partner services  and scansource security 
the company has been issued registrations for the service marks scansource and catalyst telecom in countries in its principal markets 
these trademarks and service marks do not have value assigned to them and have a designated indefinite life 
the company does not believe that its operations are dependent upon any of its trademarks or service marks 
the company also sells products and provides services under various trademarks  service marks and trade names to which reference is made in this report that are the property of owners other than the company

risk factors 
an investment in our common stock involves a number of risks 
you should carefully consider each of the risks described below before deciding to invest in our common stock 
there also are other risks that we may not describe  generally because we currently do not perceive them to be material  which could impact us 
if any of these risks develops into actual events  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected  the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any risk factors  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
global economic downturn current world wide economic conditions and market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
financial markets throughout the world could continue to experience extreme disruption  including  among other things  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations and pricing volatility of others  and failure and potential failures of major financial institutions 
these continuing developments and the related general economic downturn may adversely impact our business and financial condition in a number of ways 
the slowdown could lead to reduced information technology spending by end users  which could adversely affect our sales 
the current tightening of credit in financial markets and the general economic downturn may adversely affect the ability of our reseller customers  vendors and service providers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and to perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
this could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services  could negatively impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis  could result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable being required  and could lead to elevated levels of obsolete inventory 
significant volatility and fluctuations in the rates of exchange for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro  could also negatively impact our customer pricing and operating results 
we continue to be unable to predict the duration and severity of the current economic downturn and disruption in financial markets or their effects on our business and results of operations  but the consequences may be materially adverse and more severe than other recent economic slowdowns 
people if we cannot continue to hire and retain high quality employees  our business and financial results may be negatively affected 
our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees  higher employee turnover  or increased salary and benefit costs 
like most businesses  our employees are important to our success and we are dependent in part on our ability to retain the services of our key management  sales  it  operational  finance and administrative personnel 
we have built our business on a set of core values and we attempt to hire employees who are committed to these values 
we want employees who will fit our culture of providing exceptional service to our vendors and customers 
in order to compete and to continue to grow  we must attract  retain  and motivate employees  including those in executive  senior management  sales  marketing  logistics  technical support and other operating positions 
many of our employees work in small teams to provide specific services to vendors and customers 
they are trained to develop their knowledge of vendor products  programs and practices  and customer business needs  as 
table of contents 
index to financial statements well as to enhance the skills required to provide exceptional service and to manage our business 
as they gain experience and develop their knowledge and skills  our employees become highly desired by other businesses 
therefore  to retain our employees  we have to provide a satisfying work environment and competitive compensation and benefits 
if our costs to retain our skilled employees increase  then our business and financial results may be negatively affected 
our continued growth is also dependent  in part  on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management  including but not limited to  michael baur  our chief executive officer 
we may not be successful in retaining the members of our senior management team or our other key employees 
while we have entered into employment agreements with key executives and have obtained a key person life insurance policy on our ceo s life  the loss of the services of mr 
baur or any member of our senior management team could also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
vendor relationships terminations of a distribution or services agreement or a significant change in supplier terms  authorizations  or conditions of sale could negatively affect our operating margins  revenue or the level of capital required to fund our operations 
a significant percentage of our net sales relates to products sold to us by relatively few vendors 
as a result of such concentration risk  terminations of supply or services agreements or a significant change in terms or conditions of sale from one or more of our more significant vendors could negatively affect our operating margins  revenues or the level of capital required to fund our operations 
our vendors have the ability to make significantly adverse changes in their sales terms and conditions  such as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to us 
we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with our significant vendors 
in certain product categories  limited price protection or return rights offered by our vendors may have a bearing on the amount of product we may be willing to stock 
our inability to pass through to our reseller customers the impact of these changes  as well as our failure to develop systems to manage ongoing vendor programs  could cause us to record inventory write downs or other losses and could have significant negative impact on our gross margins 
we receive purchase discounts and rebates from some vendors based on various factors  including goals for quantitative and qualitative sales or purchase volume and customer related metrics 
certain purchase discounts and rebates may affect gross margins 
many purchase discounts from vendors are based on percentage increases in sales of products 
our operating results could be negatively impacted if these rebates or discounts are reduced or eliminated or if our vendors significantly increase the complexity of process and costs for us to receive such rebates 
our ability to obtain particular products or product lines in the required quantities and to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is critical to our success 
our manufacturers have experienced product supply shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain suppliers to supply certain products on a timely basis 
as a result  we have experienced  and may in the future continue to experience  short term shortages of specific products 
in addition  vendors who currently distribute their products through us may decide to shift to or substantially increase their existing distribution  through other distributors  their own dealer networks  or directly to resellers or end users 
suppliers have  from time to time  made efforts to reduce the number of distributors with which they do business 
this could result in more intense competition as distributors strive to secure distribution rights with these vendors  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if vendors are not able to provide us with an adequate supply of products to fulfill our customer orders on a timely basis or we cannot otherwise obtain particular products or a product line or vendors substantially increase their existing distribution through other distributors  their own dealer networks  or directly to resellers  our reputation  sales and profitability may suffer 

table of contents 
index to financial statements customer relationships we operate in a highly competitive environment and good customer relations are critical to our success 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and expand our customer relationships or acquire new customers 
meeting our customers needs quickly and fairly is critical to our business success 
our transactions with our customers are generally performed on a purchase order basis rather than under long term supply agreements 
our customers generally do not have an obligation to purchase from us 
therefore  our customers can readily switch vendors 
from time to time  we experience shortages in availability of some products from vendors  and this impacts our customers decisions regarding whether to make purchases from us 
anything that negatively impacts our customer relations also can negatively impact our operating results 
accordingly  our sales can vary as a result of fluctuations in pricing  product availability  and general competitive and economic conditions 
centralized functions we have centralized a number of functions to provide efficient support to our business 
as a result  a loss or reduction of use of one of our locations could have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 
in order to be as efficient as possible  we centralize a number of critical functions 
for instance  we currently distribute products in north america from a single warehouse near memphis  tennessee with corresponding arrangements for our latin american and european markets 
similarly  we utilize a single information system based in greenville  south carolina 
while we have backup systems and business continuity plans  any significant or lengthy interruption of our ability to provide these centralized functions could significantly impair our ability to continue normal business operations 
in addition  the centralization of these functions increases our exposure to local risks  such as the availability of qualified employees and the lessening of competition for critical services  such as freight and communications 
although we have business interruption insurance  not all losses are covered  and an uninsured loss from electrical or telephone failure  fire or other casualty  or other disruption could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  there are limits on all of our insurance coverage  and it is possible that losses might exceed that coverage 
systems our ability to manage our business and monitor results is highly dependent upon information and communication systems 
a failure of these systems could disrupt our business 
we are highly dependent upon a variety of internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate our business 
in addition  our customers rely increasingly on our electronic ordering and information systems as a source for product information  including availability and pricing 
there can be no assurance that our systems will not fail or experience disruptions  and any significant failure or disruption of these systems could prevent us from making sales  ordering and delivering products and otherwise conducting our business 
in order to continue support of our growth  we plan to make significant technological upgrades to our information systems 
this can be a lengthy and expensive process that may result in a significant diversion of resources from other operations 
in addition  the information systems of companies we acquire may not be sufficient to meet our standards or we may not be able to successfully convert them to provide acceptable information on a timely and cost effective basis 
in addition  we must attract and retain qualified people to operate our systems  expand and improve them  integrate new programs effectively with our existing programs  and convert to new systems efficiently when required 
any disruption to our business due to such issues  or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated  could have an adverse affect on our financial results and operations 
many of our customers use our website to check real time product availability  see their customized pricing and to place orders 
the internet and individual websites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns 
in addition  some websites have experienced security breakdowns 
while our website has not 
table of contents 
index to financial statements experienced any material disruptions or security breakdowns  any disruptions or breaches in security or a breach that compromises sensitive information could harm our relationship with our vendors  customers and other business partners 
any material disruption of our website or the internet in general could impair our order processing or prevent our vendors and customers from accessing information and could adversely affect our operations 
international operations our international operations expose us to risks that are different from  or possibly greater than  the risks we are exposed to domestically 
we currently have facilities in seven foreign countries and sell products in a number of others 
these operations are subject to a variety of risks that either are in addition to the risks that we face domestically or are similar risks but with potentially greater exposure 
these risks include changes in international trade laws  such as the north american free trade agreement  affecting our import and export activities  including export license requirements  restrictions on the export of certain technology  and tariff changes  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  changes in  or expiration of  various foreign incentives that provide economic benefits to us  changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain employees  fluctuations of foreign currency  exchange controls and currency devaluations  potential political instability and changes in governments  terrorist or military actions that result in destruction or seizure of our assets or suspension or disruption of our operations or those of our customers  potential regulatory changes  including foreign environmental restrictions  and different general economic conditions 
our sales growth and gross profit for our international operations were adversely affected by pricing issues in our european operations caused by the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar 
this made us significantly less competitive in europe as the us dollar continued to weaken against the euro at a record rate 
our competitors  some of whom purchase inventory in us dollars  were able to lower their prices during this period without impacting their profitability 
because we have operations in canada  mexico and europe  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rate fluctuations may cause our international results to fluctuate significantly when reflected in us dollar terms 
we manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of currencies using various derivative instruments 
however  we may not be able to mitigate all foreign currency related risk 
in addition  in foreign markets we are more dependent upon third party providers of key services  such as third party freight forwarders and third party warehouses 
adverse changes in any of these third party services could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as we expand our international operations  we expect these risks to increase 
credit exposure we have credit exposure to our reseller customers 
any adverse trends in their businesses could cause us to suffer credit losses 
we have credit exposure to our reseller customers and negative trends in their businesses could increase our credit risk 
as is customary in our industry  we extend credit to our reseller customers and most of our sales are on open accounts 
we may be unable to collect on receivables if our reseller customers experience decreases in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements demand for their products and services  do not manage their businesses adequately  or otherwise become less able to pay due to adverse economic conditions 
as we grow and compete for business  our typical payment terms tend to be longer  and therefore may increase our credit risk 
while we evaluate resellers qualifications for credit and monitor our extensions of credit  these efforts cannot prevent all credit losses  and credit losses in excess of historical levels would negatively impact our performance 
in addition  for financial reporting purposes we estimate future credit losses and establish an appropriate reserve 
to the extent that our credit losses exceed those reserves  our financial performance will be negatively impacted 
narrow profit margins our narrow margins significantly impact our operating results 
because we are a distributor in a highly competitive industry  we have significant price competition that results in narrow gross profit and operating profit margins 
because these margins are narrow  fluctuations in sales can have a significant impact on our overall operating results 
competition we experience intense competition in all of our markets 
such competition could result in reduced margins and loss of our market share 
the markets that we operate in are highly competitive 
we compete on the basis of price  product availability  speed and accuracy of delivery  effectiveness of sales and marketing programs  credit availability  ability to tailor solutions to the needs of our customers  quality and breadth of product line and services  and availability of technical and product information 
our competitors include regional and national wholesale distributors as well as hardware manufacturers including most of our vendors that sell directly to resellers and to end users 
in addition  we compete with master resellers that sell to franchisees  third party dealers and end users 
certain of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
certain smaller  regional competitors  who are specialty two tier or mixed model master resellers  may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition has increased for our sales units as broadline and other value added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets 
such competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of our market share 
as a result of intense price competition in our industry  our gross margins and our operating profit margins have historically been narrow and we expect them to be narrow in the future 
to remain competitive we may be forced to offer more credit or extended payment terms to our customers 
this could result in an increase in our need for capital  increase our financing costs  increase our bad debt expenses and have a negative impact on our financial results 
growth strategies if we fail to effectively manage and implement our growth strategies  we may experience a negative effect on our business and financial results 
a significant component of our growth strategy has been to add new vendors and products  and we expect to be able to enter new product markets in the future 
expansion of our existing product markets and entry into new product markets divert the use of our resources and systems  require additional resources that might not be available or available on acceptable terms  result in new or more intense competition  may require longer implementation times or greater start up expenditures than anticipated  and may otherwise fail to achieve the desired results in a timely fashion  if at all 
in addition  while we have been very successful in adding new vendors in the past  we already represent most of the significant vendors in our primary areas of focus  and there is regular consolidation among our vendors 
as a result  there may be fewer expansion opportunities of this nature in the future 
if we are unable to increase our sales and earnings by expanding our product offerings in a cost effective manner  then the valuation of our stock may decrease 
our ability to successfully manage our growth will require continued enhancement of our operational  managerial  and financial resources and controls 
our failure to effectively manage our growth could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
additionally  our growth may increase our working capital requirements and as a result  we may require additional equity or debt financing 
such financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 

table of contents 
index to financial statements inventory the value of our inventory may be adversely affected by market and other factors 
our business  like that of other distributors  is subject to the risk that the value of our inventory will be adversely affected by price reductions by manufacturers or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of our products 
under the terms of most of our vendor agreements and the policy of most manufacturers of specialty technology products  we have some price protection and stock rotation opportunities with respect to slow moving or obsolete inventory items 
however  these protections are limited in scope and do not protect against all declines in inventory value  excess inventory  or product obsolescence  and in some instances we may not be able to fulfill all necessary conditions or successfully manage such price protection or stock rotation opportunities 
in addition  these industry practices are sometimes not reflected in vendor agreements and their application in a particular situation is dependent upon negotiations between our vendors and us 
as a result  from time to time we are required to write down the value of excess and obsolete inventory  and should any of these write downs occur at a significant level  they could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
should the current economic downturn persist  it is possible that prices may decline due to an oversupply of product  and therefore  there may be a greater risk of declines in inventory value 
in addition  our vendors may become insolvent and unable to fulfill their product obligations to us 
significant declines in inventory value in excess of established inventory reserves or dramatic changes in prevailing technologies could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
laws and regulations changes in tax laws  accounting rules  and other laws and regulations may adversely impact us 
we are subject to a wide range of local  state and federal laws and regulations 
while we plan our operations based upon existing and anticipated laws and regulations  we cannot anticipate every change and can have only little  if any  impact on others 
we are particularly susceptible to changes in income and other tax laws  laws regulating international trade  and accounting and securities disclosure laws and regulations 
for instance  a change in current accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our reported earnings 
to a lesser degree  changes in environmental regulation  including electronic waste recovery legislation  may impact us 
in each case  a change in the laws or regulations that we are required to comply with could have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial results 
quarterly fluctuations our net sales and operating results are dependent on a number of factors 
our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and these fluctuations may cause volatility in our stock price 
our net sales and operating results may fluctuate quarterly as a result of changes in demand for our products and services  the introduction of new technology  actions by our competitors  changes in vendors prices or price protection policies  changes in vendors business practices or strategies  changes in freight rates  the timing of the addition of operating expenses to support our growth  the timing of major marketing or other service projects  product supply shortages  and the general economic factors referenced above 
in addition  a substantial portion of our net sales in each quarter results from orders booked in that quarter  which are difficult to accurately forecast in advance 
as a result  our performance in one period may vary significantly from our performance in the preceding quarter  and may differ significantly from our forecast of performance from quarter to quarter 
the impact of these variances may cause volatility in our stock price 
third party freight carriers we are dependent on third parties for the delivery of a majority of our products 
changes in shipping terms or the failure or inability of our third party shippers to perform could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
we are dependent upon major shipping companies  including federal express and united parcel service  for the shipment of our products to and from our centralized warehouses 
changes in shipping terms  or the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements inability of these third party shippers to perform effectively whether as a result of mechanical failure  casualty loss  labor stoppage  or any other reason  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
recently  we have experienced significant increases in shipping costs due to increases in fuel costs 
if our shipping costs increase or remain high  it may adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass on these higher costs to our customers 
litigation we routinely are involved in litigation that can be costly and lead to adverse results 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in a wide range of disputes  some of which result in litigation 
in addition  as a public company with a large shareholder base  we are susceptible to class action and other litigation resulting from disclosures that we make and our other activities 
litigation is expensive to bring and defend  and the outcome of litigation can be adverse and significant 
not all adverse outcomes can be anticipated  and applicable accounting rules do not always require or permit the establishment of a reserve until a final result has occurred or becomes probable and estimable

overview scansource  inc is a leading wholesale distributor of specialty technology products  providing value added distribution sales to resellers in the specialty technology markets 
the company distributes more than  products worldwide 
the company has two geographic distribution segments one serving north america from the southaven  mississippi distribution center  and an international segment currently serving latin america including mexico and europe from distribution centers located in florida and mexico  and in belgium and the united kingdom  respectively 
the north american distribution segment markets automatic identification and data capture aidc and point of sale pos products through the scansource pos and barcoding sales unit  voice  data and converged communications equipment through its catalyst telecom sales unit  video conferencing  telephony and communications products through its scansource communications sales unit  and electronic security products and wireless infrastructure products through its scansource security sales unit 
the international distribution segment markets aidc  pos and barcode products through its scansource latin america and european sales units  while communication products are marketed through its scansource communications sales unit in europe 
the company was incorporated in december and is headquartered in greenville  south carolina 
the company serves north america from a single  centrally located distribution center located near the fedex hub in southaven  mississippi 
the single warehouse and strong management information system form the cornerstone of the company s cost driven operational strategy 
this strategy has been expanded to latin america and europe  with distribution centers located in florida and mexico  and in belgium and the united kingdom  respectively 

table of contents 
index to financial statements north american distribution segment the company s north american distribution segment sells products exclusively to resellers and integrators in large and growing technology markets 
key aidc vendors include cisco  datalogic  honeywell  intermec  motorola and zebra  and leading pos lines include elo  epson america  ibm  and ncr 
key communications vendors include avaya  extreme networks  juniper networks  plantronics and polycom  while dialogic supplies key components for the converged communications market 
key electronic security vendors include alvarion  axis  cisco security  datacard  digiop  dsc  fargo  ge security  hid  motorola wireless  panasonic  sony  tropos and zebra card 
during fiscal  the company relocated its north american distribution center from memphis  tennessee to a  square foot facility located in southaven  mississippi to meet the current and near term growth requirements of the north american business 
international distribution segment the company s international distribution segment sells aidc and pos and communications products exclusively to resellers and integrators in the latin american including mexican and european markets principally from the same product manufacturers as those sold by the north american distribution segment 
marketing efforts to recruit new reseller customers  competitive product pricing  the addition of new vendors  and strategic acquisitions have driven growth in net sales 
cost control profitability the company s operating income growth is driven not only by gross profits but by a disciplined control of operating expenses 
the company s operations feature a scalable information system  streamlined management  and centralized distribution  enabling it to achieve the economies of scale necessary for cost effective order fulfillment 
from its inception  the company has managed its general and administrative expenses by maintaining strong cost controls 
however  in order to continue to grow its markets  the company has invested in new initiatives including investments in new geographic markets of europe and latin america  increased marketing efforts to recruit resellers  enhancements of employee benefit plans to retain employees  and strategic acquisitions in both the north american and international distribution segments 
evaluating financial condition and operating performance the company s management places a significant emphasis on operating income and return on invested capital roic in evaluating and monitoring the company s financial condition and operating performance 
roic is used by the company to assess its efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to generate returns 
roic is computed by the company as net income plus income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization divided by invested capital 
invested capital includes all monetary capital invested calculated as follows average interest bearing debt and average shareholders equity 
the following table summarizes the company s return on invested capital ratio for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively return on invested capital ratio 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the discussion that follows this overview explains the decrease in roic from the comparative periods shown above 
the company uses roic as a performance measurement because it believes that this metric best balances the company s operating results with its asset and liability management  it excludes the results of capitalization decisions  is easily computed  communicated and understood and drives changes in shareholder value 
the components of this calculation and a reconciliation to the company s financial statements is shown  as follows reconciliation of ebitda to net income fiscal year ended june  in thousands net income plus income taxes plus interest expense plus depreciation amortization ebitda numerator invested capital calculations fiscal year ended june  in thousands equity beginning of the year equity end of the year average equity average debt invested capital denominator return on invested capital average debt is based upon average daily debt and is therefore not able to be represented in this format

north american distribution the north american distribution segment includes sales to technology resellers in the united states and canada that originate from our centralized distribution facility located in southaven  mississippi 
we note that sales to technology resellers in canada accounted for less than of total net sales for both fiscal years presented 
for the fiscal year ended june   net sales for this segment decreased by approximately million  or  as compared to the prior fiscal period 
the company s north american pos  barcoding  and security product categories saw revenues decrease by in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended june   all of these units were challenged by weaker end user demand caused by tighter credit markets and uncertain economic conditions in north america 
sales of substantially all of our major vendors and product lines were down in comparison to the prior fiscal year  as many of the larger deals and projects that we normally expect to see during the fiscal year were delayed or even cancelled 
the company has two north american sales units that sell communications products to our customers the catalyst telecom and scansource communications sales units 
the combined sales of these units were lower for the fiscal year ended june  versus the prior fiscal year 
both of these sales units were also impacted by the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in north america discussed above  and a majority of the vendors in these units experienced lower sales on a comparative basis 
for the first six months of the fiscal year ended june   our key vendor in the catalyst telecom sales unit implemented various corrective program changes in response to an unsuccessful new program roll out from the prior fiscal year 
due to the negative reaction surrounding the initial program roll out  in addition to the uncertainty associated with the subsequent changes designed to correct the program  revenues for this sales unit 
table of contents 
index to financial statements were adversely impacted as reseller purchases were delayed or lost to competitive products during the first half of the fiscal year 
we believe that this vendor continues to make progress with its programs  products  and service offerings and we are encouraged that these changes have been well received by our resellers 
accordingly  we attribute the overall lack of demand experienced over the last half of the fiscal year to be driven primarily by the uncertain economic climate and an absence of larger transactions that would normally occur in a more stable economic environment 
international distribution the international distribution segment includes sales to latin america including mexico and europe from the scansource pos and barcoding sales unit and in europe through the scansource communications sales unit 
sales for the overall international segment decreased by  or million  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  on a constant exchange rate basis  the sales decrease was approximately 
the constant currency decline in sales for both geographies was also driven by weakness in end user demand which was largely attributable to the economic downturn experienced in both europe and latin america 
gross profit the following table summarizes the company s gross profit for the fiscal years ended june th of sales june  change change in thousands north american distribution segment international distribution segment total gross profit north american distribution gross profit for the north american distribution segment decreased million  or  for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in gross profit is primarily the result of lower sales volume in all of our sales units  as previously discussed 
while total gross profit for the north american distribution segment decreased  gross profit  expressed as a percentage of net sales  actually increased to for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this improvement is largely the result of a more favorable product mix and less margin dilution due to an absence of larger deals and projects that traditionally carry lower margins 
international distribution despite a decrease in sales for the international distribution segment  gross profit actually increased by million  or for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit for the fiscal year ended june  was achieved primarily through the use of strategic inventory purchases in the anticipation of subsequent vendor price increases in our european operating segment 
these opportunistic purchases resulted in the achievement of significantly higher gross margins during the second half of the fiscal year 
as a result  gross profit  expressed as a percentage of net sales for this segment increased to in the fiscal year ended june  versus in the prior fiscal year 
while gross profit of this segment  expressed as a percentage of net sales  is typically greater than the north american distribution segment  the significant increase in gross margin percentage experienced during the quarter is a direct result of this unique buying opportunity  and does not necessarily reflect a sustainable increase in profitability for this segment

index to financial statements operating expenses the following table summarizes the company s operating expenses for the periods ended june th of sales june  change change in thousands operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june   operating expenses were million  which was slightly higher than the prior fiscal year 
approximately million of this increase is attributable to the incremental operating expenses associated with our acquisition of mtv telecom in april offsetting these incremental costs is the favorable year over year exchange rate impact on operating expenses in our international distribution segment 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to for the fiscal year ended june   compared to in the prior year comparative period 
this increase is largely due to the significant decline in revenues between the two comparable periods 
however  the increase also reflects the company s continued investment in our scansource security sales units in north america and scansource communications sales unit in europe 
operating income the following table summarizes the company s operating income for the fiscal years ended june th of sales june  change change in thousands north american distribution international distribution operating income decreased or million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was entirely the result of lower sales volumes experienced in our north america distribution segment due to the prevailing economic conditions 
while our international distribution segment also experienced lower sales volumes  the sales generated in the current year yielded significantly more gross profit than the comparative sales in the prior fiscal year  as discussed previously

table of contents 
index to financial statements interest expense reflects interest paid on borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility and long term debt 
interest expense for the period ended june  was million compared to million for the comparative prior year period 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily the result of lower average debt balances between the respective periods  and  to a much lesser extent  lower interest rates experienced between the comparative periods 
interest income for the period ended june  was consistent with the comparative prior year periods 
the company generates interest income on longer term interest bearing receivables  and  to a much lesser extent  interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances on hand 
net foreign exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transactional and functional currency re measurements  offset by net foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses 
foreign exchange losses and gains are generated as the result of fluctuations in the value of the euro versus the british pound and the us dollar versus other currencies 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company generated a net foreign exchange loss due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro  the british pound  the mexican peso  and the canadian dollar 
while the company utilizes foreign exchange contracts and debt in non functional currencies to hedge foreign currency exposure  our foreign exchange policy prohibits us from entering into speculative transactions 
during the quarter ended december   the company settled a claim against a former legal service provider resulting in a million recovery

provision for income taxes income tax expense was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  reflecting an effective tax rate of and  respectively

for the fiscal year ended june   net sales for this segment increased by million  or  as compared to the prior fiscal period 
the company s north american pos  barcoding  and security product category sales increased in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily driven by sales growth in our scanning and mobility products  and to a lesser extent  sales growth in our security product lines 
the company continues to grow by continually adding new product lines and attracting new resellers who previously bought directly from manufacturers and other distributors 
the company continues to hire additional sales representatives to better serve our new and existing customers in these product lines 
the company has two north american sales units that sell communications products to our customers the catalyst telecom sales unit and the scansource communications sales unit 
scansource communications was formed in january through the merger of former sales units t supply and paracon 
the company believes this merger will enable more sales and support resources for the units customers 
for the fiscal year ended june   net sales of communication products lines increased only slightly over the prior fiscal year to approximately billion 
a increase in sales in the scansource communications sales unit was offset by a decrease in sales in our catalyst telecom sales unit 
sales in our catalyst telecom business unit were negatively impacted by a key vendor s unsuccessful new program roll out during the fiscal year ended june  
table of contents 
index to financial statements as a result  purchases by our resellers were either delayed or lost to competitive products of other vendors due to an adverse reaction to the terms and conditions of the new program 
though the vendor subsequently announced corrective changes to the program  our sales were adversely impacted during the fiscal year ended june  international distribution the international distribution segment includes sales to latin america including mexico and europe from the scansource pos and barcoding sales unit 
prior to the fiscal year ended june   our european operations only sold pos and barcoding product lines 
however  in april  the company further expanded its communications business internationally through the acquisition of mtv telecom distribution plc  a uk based distributor of voice and data solutions 
sales of communications products were immaterial for the fiscal year ended june  sales for the overall international segment increased or million as compared to the prior fiscal year  comprised of sales growth of and in europe and latin america  respectively 
sales during the fiscal year ended june  were favorably impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations of million

the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market  and vendor incentives 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  management believes that its estimates  including those for the above described items are reasonable and that the actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue once four criteria are met the company must have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery must occur  which happens at the point of shipment this 
table of contents 
index to financial statements includes the transfer of both title and risk of loss  provided that no significant obligations remain  the price must be fixed and determinable  and collectability must be reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated losses on returns is recorded at the time of sale based on historical experience 
the company has service revenue associated with configuration and marketing  which is recognized when the work is complete and all obligations are substantially met 
the company also sells third party services  such as maintenance contracts 
since the company is acting as an agent for these services  revenue is recognized net of cost at the time of sale 
revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated to the various elements based on the relative fair value of the elements  and each revenue cycle is considered a separate accounting unit with recognition of revenue based on the criteria met for the individual element of the multiple deliverables 
allowances for trade and notes receivable the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from customers failure to make payments on accounts receivable due to the company 
management determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the accounts receivable and specific information obtained by the company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate and reduce the ability of the company s customers to make payments on their accounts  the company may be required to increase its allowance by recording additional bad debt expense 
likewise  should the financial condition of the company s customers improve and result in payments or settlements of previously reserved amounts  the company may be required to record a reduction in bad debt expense to reverse the recorded allowance 
a provision for estimated losses on returns and allowances is recorded at the time of sale based on historical experience 
inventory reserves management determines the inventory reserves required to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market based principally on the effects of technological changes  quantities of goods on hand  and other factors 
an estimate is made of the market value  less cost to dispose  of products whose value is determined to be impaired 
if these products are ultimately sold at less than estimated amounts  additional reserves may be required 
likewise  if these products are sold for more than the estimated amounts  reserves may be reduced 
vendor programs the company receives incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors

index to financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal exposure to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business is a result of its selective use of bank debt and transacting business in foreign currencies in connection with its foreign operations 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities  which include revolving credit facilities with a group of banks used to maintain liquidity and fund the company s business operations 
the nature and amount of the company s debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility  variable rate long term debt and subsidiary line of credit for the fiscal year ended june  would have resulted in a less than million increase or decrease  respectively  in pre tax income for the period 
to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations associated with the company s variable rate long term debt  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge to minimize the significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
the company s use of derivative instruments has the potential to expose the company to certain market risks including the possibility of the company s hedging activities not being as effective as anticipated in reducing the volatility of the company s cash flows  the counterparty not performing its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement  the hedging arrangement being imperfect or ineffective  or the terms of the swap or associated debt may change 
the company seeks to lessen such risks by having established a policy to identify  control  and manage market risks which may arise from changes in interest rates  as well as limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from its foreign operations in canada  mexico and europe 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  inter company loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
these risks may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
in the normal course of business  foreign exchange risk is managed by using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge these exposures  as well as balance sheet netting of exposures 
the company s board of directors has approved a foreign exchange hedging policy to minimize foreign currency exposure 
the company s policy is to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed and not to enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company monitors its risk associated with the volatility of certain foreign currencies against its functional currencies and enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize short term currency risks on cash flows 
these positions are based upon our forecasted purchases and sales denominated in certain foreign currencies 
the company continually evaluates foreign exchange risk and may enter into foreign exchange transactions in accordance with its policy 
actual variances from these forecasted transactions can adversely impact foreign exchange results 
foreign currency gains and losses are included in other expense income 
the company has elected not to designate its foreign currency contracts as hedging instruments  and therefore  the instruments are marked to market with changes in their values recorded in the consolidated income statement each period 
the underlying exposures are denominated primarily in british pounds  euros  mexican pesos and canadian dollars 
at june   the fair value of the company s currency forward contracts outstanding was a net receivable of less than million 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes
