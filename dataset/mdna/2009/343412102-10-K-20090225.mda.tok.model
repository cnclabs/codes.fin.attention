item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for purposes of reviewing this document  operating profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue excluding corporate administrative and general expense  interest expense  interest income  domestic and foreign income taxes  and other non operating income and expense items 
results of operations summary of overall company results consolidated revenue in increased to billion compared to billion in while all business segments contributed to the increase in revenue in  the oil gas segment was the primary driver  growing by percent when compared to the prior year 
over the past several years  the company has benefited from the long term growth in global demand for oil and gas and the capital spending of our clients to support this growth 
however  the global credit crisis and falling oil prices have reduced the demand for oil and gas  which is impacting the near term capital investment plans of some of our oil gas clients 
similarly  the company s other business segments could be impacted by the global recession and credit crisis 
consolidated revenue in increased by percent when compared to  primarily due to the percent higher volume of work performed in the oil gas segment and higher project execution activities in the industrial infrastructure  global services and power segments 
revenue for the power segment increased in when compared to primarily due to work on a coal fired power plant in texas that was released for full execution in revenue for the government segment declined in when compared to due to lower embassy and iraq construction work in and the substantial completion of environmental work on a large department of energy doe project and hurricane relief efforts for the federal emergency management agency fema in earnings before taxes were billion in  million in and million in earnings before taxes for increased percent compared to primarily as a result of a percent improvement in business segment operating profit 
all business segments experienced improvements in operating profit due to increases in the level of project execution activities 
the operating profit of the industrial infrastructure segment included a pre tax gain from the sale of a joint venture interest in a wind power project in the united kingdom partially offset by provisions for a fixed price telecommunications project in the united kingdom  both discussed under industrial infrastructure below 
the operating profit of the government segment also improved compared to the prior year due to the absence of charges associated with the bagram air base in afghanistan which negatively impacted the operating performance of the segment in  as discussed under government below 
the operating profit of the power segment included a provision for an uncollectible retention receivable  discussed under power below 
the improved operating performance of the business segments in was offset somewhat by higher corporate general and administrative expense  including higher compensation related costs and a loss on the sale of a building and the associated legal entity in the united kingdom 
earnings before taxes in were also higher when compared to due to lower interest expense that resulted from the deconsolidation of non recourse project finance debt in the fourth quarter of and the reduction of outstanding principal resulting from the conversion of convertible notes in earnings before taxes for increased by percent compared to primarily from the percent overall improvement in business segment operating profit and a significant increase in net interest income from higher cash balances and interest rates in all business segments  except government  had improvements in operating profit primarily due to increases in revenue from work performed 
operating profit in the government segment improved primarily due to the absence of charges associated with certain embassy projects which significantly impacted results in  as discussed below 
incentive and stock price based compensation expense  which is included in corporate administrative and general expense  was higher in compared to net interest income increased significantly in primarily as a result of higher cash balances and interest rates during the year 
the effective tax rate for was percent which includes a favorable benefit resulting from the reversal of certain valuation allowances  statute expirations and tax settlements 
the effective tax rates for and were percent and percent  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate for includes the impact of the final resolution with the us internal revenue service irs of a tax audit relating to tax years through the reduction in tax expense associated with the settlement totaled million 
the settlement lowered the effective tax rate for by percentage points 
variability in effective tax rates in recent years is discussed below under corporate  tax and other matters 
the company had net earnings of per share in compared to per share in and per share in the percent increase in earnings per share is primarily the result of increases in the level of project execution activities and includes the pre tax gain of million per share from the sale of a joint venture interest in a wind power project in the industrial infrastructure segment 
the significant increase in earnings per share includes the impact of increased project execution activities and the million per share settlement with the irs discussed above 
excluding the impact of the settlement  earnings per share increased percent compared to consolidated new awards for were billion  compared to billion in  and billion in the increase in new award activity in was primarily attributable to the oil gas and industrial infrastructure segments  partially offset by lower new awards for power 
the oil gas  global services and power segments had increases in new awards during  partially offset by decreases in new awards in the industrial infrastructure and government segments 
approximately percent of consolidated new awards for were for projects located outside of the united states 
consolidated backlog was billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  the trend of growing backlog is primarily attributable to strong demand for capital investment in oil gas markets and large awards in industrial infrastructure 
as of december   approximately percent of consolidated backlog relates to projects located outside of the united states 
for a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment  corporate administrative and general expense and other items  see segment operations and corporate  tax and other matters below 
discussion of critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates 
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply the following critical accounting policies 
engineering and construction contracts engineering and construction contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost 
contracts are segmented between types of services  such as engineering and construction  and accordingly  gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered 
the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials  labor cost and productivity  the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract cost and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
pre contract costs are expensed as incurred 
the majority of the company s engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee 
in the highly competitive markets served by the company  there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
as of december   percent of the company s backlog is cost reimbursable while percent is for guaranteed maximum  fixed or unit price contracts 
in certain instances  the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria 
failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages 
in addition  increases in contract cost can result in non recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects 
claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients  and the company has made claims against clients for cost incurred in excess of current contract provisions 
the company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred cost when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated 
recognized claims amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
in circumstances where recovery is considered probable  but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated  cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price 
backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress 
although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations  revisions to project scope and cost  and deferrals  as appropriate 
engineering and construction partnerships and joint ventures certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties 
the company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportionate consolidation basis 
under this method of accounting  the company consolidates its proportionate share of venture revenue  cost and operating profit in the consolidated statement of earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet 
the most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the oil gas  industrial infrastructure and government segments 
the company s accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established 
the company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution 
generally  these arrangements are characterized by a percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment 
execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements 
when the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution  the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenue using appropriate contract accounting principles 
financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary 
in general  a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors who are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas and fin r  disclosures about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities which requires additional disclosures by public companies with variable interests in variable interest entities 
contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionately consolidated in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures eitf and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
the company evaluates the applicability of fin r to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards  and will reevaluate applicability upon the occurrence of certain events 
deferred taxes and tax contingencies deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets of million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
the allowance for primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for us and non us subsidiaries and certain reserves on investments 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
in the first quarter of  the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in enterprises financial statements in accordance with sfas the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
also  the interpretation provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of the adoption of fin  the company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of million  increasing its liability for unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties and reducing the january  balance of retained earnings 
the company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense 
retirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended sfas 
as permitted by sfas  changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods 
assumptions concerning discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period 
the company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations and other factors 
assuming no changes in current assumptions  the company expects to fund between million and million for the calendar year  which is expected to be substantially in excess of the minimum funding required 
if the discount rate were reduced by basis points  plan liabilities would increase by approximately million 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
this statement amends sfas and requires that the funded status of plans  measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the pension benefit obligations  be recognized in the statement of financial position and that various items be recognized in other comprehensive income before they are recognized in periodic pension expense 
the statement was adopted in and resulted in a million after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss  which reduced shareholders equity 
segment operations the company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering  procurement  construction  maintenance and project management 
the company is organized into five business segments oil gas  industrial infrastructure  government  global services and power 
the oil gas segment provides design  engineering  procurement  construction and project management professional services for upstream oil and gas production  downstream refining and certain integrated petrochemical markets 
the industrial infrastructure segment provides design  engineering  procurement and construction professional services for transportation  wind power  mining and metals  life sciences  telecommunications  manufacturing  commercial and institutional development  microelectronics and healthcare clients 
the government segment provides engineering  construction  contingency response  management and operations services to the united states government 
the global services segment includes operations and maintenance activities  small capital project engineering and execution  site equipment and tool services  industrial fleet outsourcing  plant turnaround services  temporary staffing and supply chain solutions 
the power segment provides engineering  procurement  construction  program management  start up and commissioning and maintenance services to the gas fueled  solid fueled  renewables  emerging nuclear and plant betterment markets 
oil gas revenue and operating profit for the oil gas segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue operating profit both revenue and operating profit increased substantially in when compared to both and as a result of continued growth in project execution activities from the significant levels of new project awards over the last few years 
operating profit margin for the segment was percent in compared to percent in and percent in operating profit margin in is comparatively higher than in for a number of reasons  including the performance of certain large projects in the engineering phase which typically generate higher margins than projects in the construction phase and improved contributions from other projects of the segment 
the operating margin in includes the impact of a higher volume of lower margin construction related activities as a number of large projects moved from the engineering phase into on site execution 
new awards in the oil gas segment were billion in  billion in and billion in the high worldwide demand for new capacity in oil and gas exploration and refining  as well as polysilicon  has driven the increase in new project awards 
new awards in included two refinery expansion projects in the united states valued at billion and billion  and a billion polysilicon project in china 
new awards in included a billion award for the utility and offsite facilities for a new refinery in the middle east and refinery expansion projects in spain and the united states amounting to billion and billion  respectively 
new awards in included a billion refinery expansion in the united states  a billion project in saudi arabia and a project in excess of billion in qatar 
backlog for the oil gas segment was billion at december   up sequentially from billion at december  and billion at december  the and growth in backlog is primarily due to the continued strength of new award activity and positive scope related cost adjustments to existing projects 
the segment has been a participant in an expanding market that includes very large projects in diverse geographical locations  which are well suited to the company s global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position 
however  the global credit crisis and falling oil prices have resulted in some clients reassessing their capital spending plans for as such  there is some uncertainty as to the sustainability of the high growth and operating profit margins recently experienced by the segment 
total assets in the segment increased to billion at december  from million at december  and million at december  primarily due to the continued increase in the level of project execution activities over the periods 
industrial infrastructure revenue and operating profit for the industrial infrastructure segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue operating profit revenue in improved slightly from on the strength of the mining and metals and manufacturing and life sciences business lines 
revenue increased during compared to primarily as a result of project execution activities on mining and infrastructure projects 
the revenue growth for the industrial infrastructure segment has been accompanied by substantial operating profit and operating profit margin increases  primarily as the result of improved performance in mining and a pre tax gain of million from the sale of a joint venture interest in a wind power project in the united kingdom 
the higher margins for the mining and metals business line in are largely attributable to an increase in the mix of engineering and consulting projects  which typically generate higher margins than projects in the construction phase 
the segment s ability to command more favorable pricing due to its capabilities and project execution performance  along with industry wide resource constraints  also contributed to the higher mining margins in operating profit and operating profit margin increased during compared to  largely on the strength of performance on mining and infrastructure projects 
operating results for the segment have been impacted in all three years by loss provisions relating to specific projects 
looking ahead  the segment could be impacted by the global credit crisis and falling commodity prices  as some clients  particularly in the mining and metals business line  are reassessing their capital spending programs for projects originally planned for could be delayed or canceled 
the company is involved in dispute resolution proceedings in connection with its london connect project  a million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows transmission and reception throughout the london underground system 
the project  which is now complete  has been subject to significant delays by the owner  resulting in additional cost to the company and claims against the client 
the company has recognized an aggregate of million in claims revenue relating to incurred costs attributed to delay and disruption claims that are part of the dispute resolution proceedings  reduced for settlement amounts 
total claims related cost incurred to date and the value of the claims submitted or identified exceed the amount recorded in claims revenue 
in addition  the client withheld million representing the company s share of liquidated damages  a substantial portion of which has been reserved for possible non collection 
during  provisions of million were recognized as the result of reassessments of the remaining time and cost to complete the project and the probability of recovery of liquidated damages and certain claims 
the company participates in a joint venture that is completing a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in california 
the project continues to be subject to circumstances resulting in additional cost including owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth  cost escalation  additional labor and schedule delays 
the company continues to evaluate the impact of these circumstances on estimated total project cost  as well as claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project 
during and  provisions of million and million  respectively  were recognized due to increases in estimated cost 
the company continues to incur legal expenses associated with the claims and dispute resolution process 
as of december   the company has recognized in cost and revenue its million proportionate share of million of cost relating to claims recognized by the joint venture 
total claims related costs incurred  as well as claims submitted to the client by the joint venture  are in excess of the million of recognized cost 
as of december   the client withheld liquidated damages totaling million from amounts otherwise due the joint venture and has asserted additional claims against the joint venture 
the company believes that the claims against the joint venture are without merit and that amounts withheld will ultimately be recovered by the joint venture and has  therefore  not recognized any reduction in project revenue for its million proportionate share of the withheld liquidated damages 
in addition  the client has drawn down million against letters of credit provided by the company and its joint venture partner 
the company believes that the amounts drawn down against the letters of credit will ultimately be recovered by the joint venture and  as such  has not reserved for the possible non recovery of the company s million proportionate share 
the project opened to traffic in november and is expected to be completed in the spring of new awards in the industrial infrastructure segment were billion during  billion during  and billion in new awards during reflected a substantial increase in the mining and metals business line and also included a billion infrastructure project in the united kingdom 
new awards during were also concentrated in the mining sector and included a billion transportation infrastructure project in virginia 
new awards during increased across most of the segment s business lines  with new mining projects representing approximately percent of the total 
ending backlog for the segment increased to billion for from billion for and billion for total assets in the industrial infrastructure segment were million at december   largely comparable to the million of total assets at december  total assets at december  were million and included the consolidation of the national roads telecommunication services project in the united kingdom  which was deconsolidated in government revenue and operating profit for the government segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue operating profit revenue in increased slightly compared to revenue in primarily due to the start up of the savannah river site management and operating project in south carolina savannah river which offsets reduced contributions from the embassy projects and iraq related work 
other contributors to revenue include continued support for the public assistance program in support of the federal emergency management agency fema  the hanford environmental management project in washington and work that began in late in support of logistics augmentation program logcap iv task orders for the united states army in afghanistan 
the substantial decrease in revenue in compared to was primarily attributable to significantly reduced contributions from fema hurricane relief task orders  iraq related work and the fernald project that was completed in october operating profit for the government segment during increased significantly compared to and  primarily due to the absence of significant provisions for loss projects that had been made in the earlier two years 
operating profit in was also favorably impacted by work that began at the savannah river project and for logcap iv task orders 
provisions totaling million and million were made in and  respectively  on a fixed priced contract at the bagram air base in afghanistan 
these charges related to subcontractor execution issues and liquidated damages due to the resulting delay in project completion 
during  the bagram project was completed and various disputed items and warranty issues were resolved 
as a result  million was recognized in operating profit during the year 
the remaining disputed items and warranty obligations are expected to be addressed in operating profit in was negatively impacted by loss provisions for estimated cost overruns totaling million on certain embassy projects 
provisions totaling million had been previously recognized in the company has performed work on embassy projects over the last five years for the united states department of state under fixed price contracts 
these projects were adversely impacted by higher cost due to schedule extensions  scope changes causing material deviations from the standard embassy design  increased cost to meet client requirements for additional security cleared labor  site conditions at certain locations  subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor 
as of december   all embassy projects were complete  with some warranty items still pending 
as of december   aggregate cost totaling million relating to claims on three of the embassy projects has been recognized in revenue 
total claims related cost incurred to date  along with claims for equitable adjustment submitted or identified  exceed the amount recorded in claims revenue 
as the first formal step in dispute resolution  all of these claims have been certified in accordance with federal contracting requirements 
the company continues to periodically evaluate its position with respect to these claims 
new awards in the government segment were billion during  compared to billion during and billion during the increase in new awards in was driven by the start up of the savannah river project and the first task orders issued to the company under logcap iv 
the savannah river project s transitional work and first full year of operations were included as a new award in the company reports new awards for logcap iv as individual task orders are awarded and funded 
the decrease in new awards in was due to the significant decrease in emergency response work for fema and reconstruction activities in iraq 
many projects  like savannah river  are performed on behalf of us government clients under multi year contracts and provide for annual funding 
as a result  new awards for the government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing months for annually funded contracts 
backlog for the government segment was million at december   million at december  and million at december  the decline in backlog in from was primarily due to progress toward completion on iraq contracts 
total assets in the government segment were million at december   million at december  and million at december  the decrease in total assets from the end of was primarily due to the billing and collection of substantially all of the previously unbilled fees on the fernald project and progress towards completion on the fema and iraq reconstruction contracts 
global services revenue and operating profit for the global services segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue operating profit the increase in revenue reflects continued growth across most of the global services segment s various business lines 
the operations and maintenance business line experienced broad based growth in the majority of its markets during  but its results were unfavorably impacted by delays in refinery turnarounds and hurricanes in the gulf coast region of the united states 
the revenue increase was driven primarily by growth in the operations and maintenance business line 
the segment continues to implement a disciplined growth strategy through widespread expansion of existing core competencies and regional deployment of new services and business models 
operating profit and operating profit margin increases for and reflect the strong business environment that has extended across most of global services markets 
additionally  operating profit in was favorably impacted by hurricane recovery activities 
during the fourth quarter of  global services began to be impacted by the current global economic downturn  particularly for natural resource prospects 
the drop in commodity prices has caused delays of work originally planned for and operating profit margin in the global services segment was percent  percent  and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
operations and maintenance activities that have yet to be performed comprise global services backlog 
the equipment  temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines do not report backlog or new awards 
in recent years  global services has derived larger percentages of its revenue and operating profit from these non backlog reporting business lines and from short duration operations and maintenance activities 
therefore  global services revenue and profit increases may outpace backlog growth 
new awards in the global services segment were billion during  billion during and billion during new awards for all three years included new work and renewals for key clients 
backlog for the global services segment was billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  total assets in the global services segment were million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  the decrease in total assets in was due to the reduction in working capital in the equipment  supply chain solutions and operations and maintenance business lines 
the increase in assets in was primarily the result of investments in equipment and working capital to support revenue growth 
power revenue and operating profit for the power segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue operating profit revenue in and increased substantially as the result of higher levels of project execution activities from projects awarded over the last few years  including the oak grove coal fired power project in texas for luminant  a unit of energy futures holdings corporation  that was awarded in the second quarter of revenue levels in were negatively impacted by the reduced level of construction of new power plants following the completion of the most recent building cycle in operating profit margin in the power segment increased to percent during from percent during and percent during operating profit and operating profit margin increased in and as a result of higher levels of project execution activities  including the oak grove project 
in addition  the operating profit margin in reflects higher margin front end services in the nuclear business line 
also reflected in operating profit  but as a partial offset to the drivers of margin improvement  was a fourth quarter provision for an uncollectible retention receivable of million for the rabigh combined cycle power plant in saudi arabia  discussed in more detail under litigation and matters in dispute resolution below 
the lower operating profit and operating profit margin were the combined result of a charge associated with the final resolution of a project dispute  a loss on another project  a concentration of projects that were in the early stages where profit recognition is generally lower and higher overhead spending in anticipation of increasing revenue in an expanding market 
projects in the power segment are often bid and awarded on a fixed price basis 
this method of contracting provides opportunities for margin improvement resulting from successful execution  but also exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays 
the power segment has been impacted by delays in obtaining air permits for coal fired power plants due to concerns over carbon emissions 
in addition  power producers have been impacted by the global credit crisis 
new awards in the power segment are typically large in amount  but occur on an irregular basis 
new awards of billion in include a gas fired power plant in texas  expansions to an existing emissions control retrofit program in kentucky and an emissions control retrofit program in texas for luminant 
new awards of billion in included billion for the oak grove award 
new awards of million during included a plant retrofit project in south carolina 
backlog for the power segment was billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  the increase in backlog since december  is largely due to the new award for the oak grove project 
total assets in the power segment were million at december   million at december  and million at december  corporate  tax and other matters corporate for the three years ended december   and  corporate administrative and general expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to higher compensation related costs and a million loss on the sale of a building and the associated legal entity in the united kingdom 
these increases in corporate administrative and general expenses are offset somewhat by foreign currency gains 
corporate administrative and general expense includes million of non operating expense in  of which million is for the loss on the sale of the building and associated legal entity discussed above  compared to non operating income of million during and non operating expense of million relating principally to an investment impairment provision during the increase in corporate administrative and general expenses in from is primarily due to higher incentive and stock based compensation cost as a result of the increase in the value of the company s stock 
the amount includes million from the adoption of the new share based compensation accounting standard and million of expenses related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters from southern california to the dallas fort worth metropolitan area that was completed in the second quarter of net interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net interest income increased in primarily due to lower interest expense that resulted from the deconsolidation of non recourse project finance debt in the fourth quarter of and the reduction of outstanding principal resulting from the conversion of convertible notes in net interest income increased significantly in primarily as a result of higher cash balances and interest rates during the year 
the amount includes interest expense on outstanding commercial paper balances during the first six months of that were required to support project execution activities and interest expense from the consolidation of non recourse project finance debt during the year 
though the company is expected to continue to maintain high cash and marketable securities positions in  lower interest rates could significantly reduce interest income 
tax the effective tax rates on the company s pretax earnings were percent  percent and percent for the years  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for was favorably impacted by the reversal of certain valuation allowances of million and statute expirations and tax settlements of million 
the lower effective rate in was due to the reduction of income tax expense for the year as the result of an irs appeals settlement in connection with the irs examination of the company s income tax returns for the period november  through december  the effective tax rate includes a favorable benefit resulting from the extraterritorial income exclusion and the reversal of certain valuation allowances  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of tax rate changes on certain state deferred taxes 
litigation and matters in dispute resolution conex international v 
fluor enterprises  inc in november  a jefferson county  texas  jury reached an unexpected verdict in the case of conex international conex v 
fluor enterprises inc fei  ruling in favor of conex and awarding million in damages related to a construction project

fei was also hired to provide certain engineering advice to atofina on the project 
there was no contract between conex and fei 
later in after the project was complete  conex and atofina negotiated a final settlement for extra work on the project 
conex sued fei in september alleging damages for interference and misrepresentation and demanding that fei should pay conex the balance of the extra work charges that atofina did not pay in the settlement 
conex also asserted that fei interfered with conex s contract and business relationship with atofina 
the jury verdict awarded damages for the extra work and the alleged interference 
the company appealed the decision and the judgment against the company was reversed in its entirety in december and remanded for a new trial 
fluor daniel international and fluor arabia ltd 
v 
general electric company  et al in october  fluor daniel international and fluor arabia ltd 
filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against general electric company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as saudi american general electric samge  a saudi arabian corporation 
the complaint sought damages in connection with the procurement  engineering and construction of the rabigh combined cycle power plant in saudi arabia 
on april   the arbitration panel issued a partial final award stipulating the amount of entitlement to recovery of certain claims and awarding interest on the net amounts due to fluor 
a final award on the calculation of interest due to fluor has been received 
all amounts have been collected except for post award  pre judgment interest of approximately million and a retention receivable of million to be paid by samge after it receives payment from the owner 
in the fourth quarter of  a provision was recognized for the full amount of the unpaid retention receivable as the result of a re assessment by the company of the likelihood that samge would ever receive payment from the owner 
fluor corporation v 
citadel equity fund ltd 
citadel equity fund ltd  a hedge fund and investor in the company s percent convertible senior notes the notes  and the company are disputing the calculation of the number of shares of the company s common stock that were due to citadel upon conversion of approximately million of notes 
citadel argues that it is entitled to an additional million in value under its proposed calculation method 
the company believes that the payout given to citadel was proper and correct and that citadel s claims are without merit 
the company is vigorously defending its position 
other as of december   a number of matters relating to completed and in progress projects are in the dispute resolution process 
these include an infrastructure joint venture project and the london connect project  which are discussed above under industrial infrastructure and certain embassy projects  which are discussed above under government 
financial position and liquidity cash provided by operating activities during was million compared to million in and million in cash provided by operating activities during  and resulted primarily from earning sources and increases in customer advance billings 
cash generated by operating activities in also includes the billing and collection of fees on the fernald project 
the levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix  stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects 
the increase in new awards over the last three years will continue to result in periodic start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients 
as work progresses on individual projects and client payments on invoiced amounts increase  cash used in start up activities is recovered and project cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion 
liquidity is also provided by substantial advance billings on contracts in progress 
as customer advances are used in project execution and if they are not replaced by advances on new projects  the company s cash position will be reduced 
in the event there is net new investment in operating assets that exceeds available cash balances the company maintains short term borrowing facilities to satisfy any periodic net operating cash outflows

capital expenditures during included million for construction of the new corporate headquarters facility in texas  but otherwise relate primarily to the equipment operations in the global services segment that support engineering and construction projects 
the increase in capital expenditures over the past three years largely relates to the ongoing renewal and replacement of equipment in the construction equipment operations and investments in computer infrastructure upgrades 
capital expenditures in future years are expected to include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the global services segment  purchase and refurbishment of other facilities and computer infrastructure in support of the company s continuing investment in automated systems 
the company holds excess cash in bank deposits and marketable securities 
these investments are governed by the company s investment policy  which focuses on  in order of priority  the preservation of capital  maintenance of liquidity and maximization of yield

during  the company amended and restated its senior credit facility  increasing the size from million to billion and extending the maturity to in february  the company issued million of percent convertible senior notes the notes due february  and received proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts 
proceeds from the notes were used to pay off the then outstanding commercial paper and million was used to obtain ownership of engineering and corporate office facilities in california through payoff of the lease financing 
in december  the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the notes in cash 
notes are convertible during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of the company s common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to percent of the conversion price in effect on that th trading day the trigger price 
the split adjusted trigger price is currently  but is subject to adjustment as outlined in the indenture 
the trigger price condition has been satisfied during each period since the fourth quarter of and the notes have therefore been classified as short term debt as of december  and during  holders converted million of the notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus  shares of the company s common stock 
during  holders converted million of the notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus  shares of the company s common stock

on december   the company registered shares of its common and preferred stock  debt securities and warrants pursuant to its filing of a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
a warrant for the purchase of  shares was exercised in  yielding proceeds of million 
proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash flow of approximately million during each of and and million during the company has a common stock repurchase program  authorized by the board of directors  to purchase shares in open market or negotiated transactions 
during and   shares and  shares  respectively  of company stock were repurchased by the company under its stock repurchase program

in the first quarter of  the company s board of directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividends payable to per share split adjusted 
previously  in the first quarter of  the company s board of directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividends to per share split adjusted from per share split adjusted 
declared dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared 
however  for the dividend paid to shareholders as of january   payment by the company to the disbursing agent occurred in the month of december  resulting in two cash payments by the company in the fourth quarter of and none in the first quarter of the payment and level of future cash dividends is subject to the discretion of the company s board of directors 
during  exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the company s international operations weakened against the us dollar  resulting in unrealized translation losses that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive loss 
during and  exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the company s international operations strengthened against the us dollar  resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income 
unrealized losses of million in  and unrealized gains of million in and million in relate to the effect of exchange rate changes on cash 
the cash held in foreign currencies will primarily be used for project related expenditures in those currencies  and therefore  the company s exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal 
liquidity is provided by cash generated from operations  advance billings on new awards and contracts in progress and access to financial markets 
as the cash advances are reduced through use in project execution and  if not replaced by advances on new projects  the company s cash position may decline 
while the impact of continued market volatility cannot be predicted  the company believes that for the next months  cash generated from operations and advance billings  along with its unused credit capacity and the option to issue debt or equity securities  if required  is expected to be sufficient to fund operating requirements 
the company s conservative financial strategy and consistent performance have earned it strong credit ratings resulting in continued access to the tighter financial markets 
the company s total debt to total capitalization debt to capital ratio at december  was percent compared to percent at december  off balance sheet arrangements the company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts 
the company has billion in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit 
letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts 
at december   the company had billion in letters of credit outstanding 
the company has million in credit lines for general purposes in addition to the amount above 
the company s access to the commercial paper market has been limited as a result of the current financial crisis 
however  the company s short term financing needs are not expected to be impacted due to its high cash balances and access to short term borrowing sources 
the company also posts surety bonds as generally required by commercial terms  primarily to guarantee its performance on state and local government projects 
contractual obligations at december  are summarized as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total year or less years years over years in millions debt convertible senior notes municipal bonds interest on debt obligations operating leases uncertain tax contingencies joint venture contributions pension minimum funding other post employment benefits other compensation related obligations total interest is based on the borrowings that are presently outstanding and the timing of payment indicated in the above table 
interest relating to possible future debt issuances is excluded since an accurate outlook of interest rates and amounts outstanding cannot be reasonably predicted 
operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in sugar land  texas  the united kingdom and various other u 
s and international locations  equipment used in connection with long term construction contracts and other personal property 
uncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities 
the total amount of uncertain tax contingencies is included in the over years column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments 
if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires  then additional payments will not be necessary 
the company generally provides funding to its us and us pension plans to at least the minimum required by applicable regulations 
in determining the minimum required funding  the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future 
in management s judgment  minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated 
where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of accumulated benefit obligations  additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources 
principally deferred executive compensation 
guarantees  inflation and insurance arrangements guarantees in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated partnerships  joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts 
these agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities 
the guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances 
the maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts 
the amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totaled billion as of december  amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable 
for cost reimbursable contracts  amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract 
for lump sum or fixed price contracts  this amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract 
remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete 
in those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract  the company may have recourse to third parties  such as owners  co venturers  subcontractors or vendors for claims 
the carrying value of the liability for guarantees was not material as of december  or financial guarantees  made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances  are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower 
most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property  plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay 
as of december   there were no material guarantees outstanding 
inflation although inflation and cost trends affect the company  its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix the company s cost at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts 
the company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions  however  management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business 
insurance arrangements the company utilizes a number of providers to meet its insurance and surety needs 
the current financial crisis has not disrupted the company s insurance or surety programs or limited its ability to access needed insurance or surety capacity 
variable interest entities in the normal course of business  the company forms partnerships or joint ventures primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects 
applying the guidance of fin r  the company evaluates qualitative and quantitative information for each partnership or joint venture at inception to determine  first  whether the entity formed is a variable interest entity vie and  second  if the company is the primary beneficiary and needs to consolidate the entity 
upon the occurrence of certain events outlined in fin r  the company reassesses its initial determination of whether the entity is a vie and whether consolidation is still required 
a partnership or joint venture is considered a vie if either a the total equity investment is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  b characteristics of a controlling financial interest are missing either the ability to make decisions through voting or other rights  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity  or c the voting rights of the equity holders are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity and or their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity  and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights 
the company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie and consolidates the entity if the company will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns or both 
the company considers all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests when determining if it is the primary beneficiary 
the majority of the partnerships and joint ventures that are formed for the execution of the company s projects are vies because the total equity investment is typically nominal and not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
however  often the vie does not meet the consolidation requirements of fin r 
the contractual agreements that define the ownership structure and equity investment at risk  distribution of profits and losses  risks  responsibilities  indebtedness  voting rights and board representation of the respective parties are used to determine if the entity is a vie and if the company is the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the entity 
the partnerships or joint ventures of the company are typically characterized by a percent or less  non controlling  ownership or participation interest  with decision making and distribution of expected gains and losses typically being proportionate to the ownership or participation interest 
as such and as noted above  even when the partnership or joint venture is determined to be a vie  the company is frequently not the primary beneficiary 
should losses occur in the execution of the project for which the vie was established  the losses would be absorbed by the partners of the vie 
the majority of the partnership and joint venture agreements provide for capital calls to fund operations  as necessary  however  such funding is rare and is not currently anticipated 
some of the company s vies have debt  but the debt is typically non recourse in nature 
at times  the company s participation in vies requires agreements to provide financial or performance assurances to clients 
see guarantees  inflation and insurance arrangements above for a further discussion of such agreements 
as of december  the company had a number of entities that were determined to be vies  with the majority not meeting the consolidation requirements of fin r 
most of the unconsolidated vies are proportionately consolidated  though the equity and cost methods of accounting for the investments are also used  depending on the company s respective participation rights  amount of influence in the vie and other factors 
the aggregate investment carrying value of the unconsolidated vies was million at december  and was classified under investments in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its investments in unconsolidated vies is typically limited to the aggregate of the carrying value of the investment and future funding commitments 
future funding commitments at december  for the unconsolidated vies were million 
in some cases  the company is required to consolidate vies 
the carrying value of the assets and liabilities for consolidated vies at december  was million and million  respectively 
none of the vies are individually material to the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
below is a discussion of a couple of the company s more unique vies and related accounting considerations 
national roads telecommunications services nrts project in  the company s industrial infrastructure segment was awarded a million project by a joint venture  genesys telecommunications limited genesys  in which the company owns a percent interest and hsbc infrastructure fund management limited owns a percent interest 
the project was entered into with the united kingdom secretary of state for transport the highways agency to design  build  maintain and finance a significant upgrade to the integrated transmission network throughout england s motorways 
genesys financed the engineering and construction e c of the upgraded telecommunications infrastructure with approximately million of non recourse debt the term loan facility from a consortium of lenders the banks along with joint venture member equity contributions and subordinated debt which were financed during the construction period utilizing equity bridge loans from outside lenders 
during september  the joint venture members paid their required permanent financing commitments in the amount of million and were issued subordinated notes by genesys 
these funds were used by genesys to repay the temporary construction term financing including the company s equity bridge loan 
in early october  the newly constructed network achieved operational status and was fully accepted by the highways agency on december   thereby concluding the e c phase and entering the operations and maintenance phase of the project 
based on a qualitative analysis of the variable interests of all parties involved at the formation of genesys  under the provisions of fin r  the company was initially determined to be the primary beneficiary of the joint venture 
the company s consolidated financial statements included the accounts of genesys  and  accordingly  the non recourse debt provided by the banks at the inception of the venture 
effective october   the company no longer consolidates the accounts of genesys because it is no longer the primary beneficiary of the joint venture 
fin r requires that the initial determination of whether an entity is a vie shall be reconsidered under certain conditions 
one of those conditions is when the entity s governing documents or contractual arrangements are changed in a manner that changes the characteristics or adequacy of the entity s equity investment at risk 
such an event occurred in september upon the infusion of capital by the joint venture members which resulted in permanent financing through issuance of subordinated debentures by genesys that replaced the temporary equity bridge loans that had been provided by outside lenders 
this refinancing of temporary debt with permanent debt constituted a change in the governing documents of genesys that required reconsideration of genesys as a vie 
based on the new capitalization structure of genesys  the adequacy of the equity at risk in genesys was evaluated and found to be inadequate to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support 
accordingly  upon reconsideration  genesys continues to be a vie 
because the company holds a variable interest in the entity through its equity and debt investments  a qualitative evaluation was undertaken to determine if it was the primary beneficiary 
in this evaluation  the company considered all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests based on the contractual arrangements existing at the time of reconsideration 
based on this evaluation  the company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of genesys 
accordingly  genesys was not consolidated in the company s accounts at december  and december   respectively  and is being accounted for on the equity method of accounting 
based on contractual documents  the company s maximum exposure to loss relating to its investment in genesys is its aggregate million equity and debt investment plus any un remitted earnings 
the term loan is an obligation of genesys and will never be a debt repayment obligation of the company because it is non recourse to the joint venture members 
interstate capital beltway project in december  the company was awarded the billion interstate capital beltway high occupancy toll hot lanes project in virginia 
the project is a public private partnership between the virginia department of transportation vdot and capital beltway express llc  a joint venture in which the company has a ten percent interest and transurban usa inc has a percent interest fluor transurban 
under the agreement  vdot owns and oversees the addition of traffic lanes  interchange improvements and construction of hot lanes on miles of the i capital beltway in northern virginia 
fluor transurban  as concessionaire  will develop  design  finance  construct  maintain and operate the improvements and hot lanes under an year concession agreement 
the construction is being financed through grant funding from vdot  non recourse borrowings from issuance of public tax exempt bonds  a non recourse loan from the federal transportation infrastructure finance innovation act tifia which is administered by the us department of transportation and equity contributions from the joint venture members 
the construction of the improvements and hot lanes are being performed by a construction joint venture in which the company has a percent interest and lane construction has a percent interest fluor lane 
transurban usa inc will perform the operations and maintenance upon completion of the improvements and commencement of operations of the toll lanes 
the company has evaluated its interest in fluor lane and has determined  based on a qualitative analysis  that the entity is a vie 
the company has further determined from an analysis of risk and contractual agreements that it is the primary beneficiary of fluor lane since the company absorbs the majority of fluor lane s expected returns or losses 
accordingly  the company consolidates fluor lane 
as of december   the company s financial statements include assets of million and liabilities of million for fluor lane 
fluor transurban has been determined to be a vie under the provisions of fin r 
pursuant to the requirements of fin r  the company evaluated its interest in fluor transurban including its project execution obligations and risks relating to its interest in fluor lane and has determined based on a qualitative analysis that it is not the primary beneficiary of fluor transurban 
based on contractual documents  the company s maximum exposure to loss relating to its investment in fluor transurban is its million aggregate equity investment commitment  of which million has been funded  plus any un remitted earnings 
the company will never have repayment obligations associated with any of the debt because it is non recourse to the joint venture members 
the company accounts for its ownership interest in fluor transurban on the equity method of accounting 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests excess cash in short term securities  primarily time deposits  that carry a floating money market rate of return 
additionally  a substantial portion of the company s cash balances are maintained in foreign countries 
all of the company s long term debt instruments carry a fixed rate coupon 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk on fixed rate debt is not material due to the low interest rates on these obligations 
the company utilizes derivative instruments to hedge exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices to minimize the volatility of project cost 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   the company had foreign exchange forward contracts of less than years duration to exchange major world currencies for us dollars 
the total gross notional amount of these contracts was million 
at december  the company had commodity swap forward contracts of less than years duration and a total gross notional amount of million 
the company does not currently use derivatives  such as swaps  to alter the interest characteristics of its short term securities or its debt instruments 
during  exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the company s international operations weakened against the us dollar  resulting in unrealized translation losses that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive loss
