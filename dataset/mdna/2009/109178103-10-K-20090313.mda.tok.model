rocky mountains province we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our activities to areas that may offer attractive exploration and development potential  with a particular interest in those plays that complement our current exploration  development and production activities 
in late  we began accumulating acreage in the williston basin located in north dakota and montana and in early entered into a joint venture agreement in the powder river basin located in wyoming 
during  we invested approximately million in drilling  land and seismic in the williston and powder river basins 
during  we spud gross wells in the province with six wells completing and five wells still drilling at year end 

table of contents williston basin the williston basin is spread across north dakota  montana and parts of southern canada with the united states portion of the basin encompassing approximately  square miles 
the basin produces oil and gas from numerous producing horizons including  but not limited to  the bakken  three forks and red river formations  which are currently our primary objectives 
the bakken is an unconventional oil shale play at depths of approximately  to  feet that is primarily exploited via horizontal drilling and advanced completion techniques 
advanced completion techniques include the use of swell packers and multi stage fracture stimulations  which help to fracture the shales and increase oil flow to the well bore 
to date  much of the bakken drilling in north dakota has occurred east of the nesson anticline in and around mountrail county 
additional activity is ongoing south of the nesson anticline in dunn county and permitting and drilling activity has accelerated west of the nesson anticline in mckenzie and williams counties  north dakota 
the three forks appears to be a unconventional carbonate play that lies just below the bakken 
similar to the bakken  the three forks is primarily exploited using horizontal drilling and advanced completion techniques 
drilling in the three forks began in mid and a number of operators including ourselves are targeting this objective 
drilling in this objective is early  but initial results appear to indicate that the three forks is apparently a separate reservoir from the bakken and thereby increases our exposure to oil reserves in the basin 
over time  further drilling of both bakken and three forks wells in the same section will help to delineate whether the bakken and three forks are separate reservoirs 
the red river is a conventional oil resource at a depth of approximately  feet 
the red river is exploited via vertical well bores with minimal completion procedures 
targets are identified using d seismic attribute analysis which we believe is a propriety methodology 
since late  we have drilled and completed three red river discoveries in sheridan county  montana 
in january  we completed a number of operated wells including the bergstrom family trust h  which was our first well east of the nesson anticline in mountrail county  north dakota  the hynek h and the bakke h 
in march  we completed the operated hallingstad h  which is located approximately one mile west of the bergstrom family trust h well 
after completing the hallingstad h  we moved our rig to a location proximal to the hynek h to drill the operated manitou state h 
in july  we successfully completed the sidetrack of our operated mrachek h well  located west of the nesson anticline in mckenzie county  north dakota 
the mrachek was completed using seven fracture stimulations and we experienced significantly improved results as compared to the field h and erickson h  which are also west of the nesson anticline 
the field and erickson were drilled and completed using one large fracture stimulation in the second half of and were our first horizontal bakken wells 
we believe the improved well results west of the nesson are attributable to improved completion techniques that incorporated swell packers and multiple stage fracture stimulations 
in july  we also successfully completed our operated johnson h in the north stanley area of mountrail county  north dakota  which is approximately miles northeast of our manitou state well 
the johnson h was completed with a stage fracture stimulation 
in late july  we successfully completed our operated carkuff h  which was completed with a stage fracture stimulation 
the carkuff h is located approximately one mile west of the bakke h which was completed with fracture stimulations 
we believe the improvement in the initial production rate of the carkuff relative to the bakke is attributable to the increase number of fracture stimulation stages as well as the use of the perf and plug completion technique versus the sliding sleeve technique 

table of contents in october  we successfully completed our first three forks test  the adix h  which is located approximately one mile southeast of the bakke h 
the adix h  at that point  represented our fifth consecutive completion in the ross area 
the four prior completions were in the bakken formation 
in late october  a number of our higher working interest non operated wells were completed in the parshall austin area of mountrail county  north dakota 
we participated with a working interest in the eog austin h and participated with a working interest in the eog wayzetta h 
we also participated with a working interest in the slawson payara h 
also in late october  we successfully completed our kvamme h  which we operated with a working interest 
in february  we announced the successful completion of our operated olson h  a long lateral  approximately  feet  completed with fracture stimulations 
the olson well is located between the field h and erickson h in williams county 
we own a working interest and an approximate revenue interest in the well 
another late long lateral bakken well  our operated figaro h well  is located in mckenzie county and is waiting on completion 
also in february  we announced the successful completion of our operated friedrich trust  a red river well located approximately mile from our richardson in sheridan county  montana 
the well was successfully drill stem tested with oil collected in the test chamber 
we own a working interest and an approximate revenue interest in the friedrich trust 
the well is expected to come on line to production by the end of march 
subsequent to drilling the olson and figaro  we moved both of our operated rigs east of the nesson anticline to drill the strobeck h  which will be a three forks test completed with twenty fracture stimulation stages  and the anderson h  which will be a bakken well 
the strobeck h is located less than two miles west of the adix h 
the anderson h will be a long lateral well and we also plan to complete the well with fracture stimulation stages 
the anderson h is located approximately miles west of our carkuff h 
we are awaiting declines in service costs prior to completing both the strobeck and anderson wells 
during  we currently expect to spend approximately million to drill and complete wells that were in progress at year end and on other activities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital commitments overview of activity 
powder river basin in february  we signed a letter of intent to acquire a working interest in an unconventional shale play in the powder river basin located in wyoming 
eighteen vertical wells in the area  which date as far back as  targeted the approximate foot mowry shale at depths of about  feet 
individual wells produced between to barrels of oil per day 
our obligations to carry our partners for the drilling and completion of two horizontal wells and million of land acquisition costs were fulfilled in resulting in us earning a working interest in approximately  net acres 
in  we spent million in the powder river basin 
in november  we spud the krejci federal h well  which is proximate to our first well in the basin  the krejci federal h 
in june  we announced that the well was flowing approximately barrels of oil per day 
we do not currently have any plans to drill additional wells in the powder river basin 
onshore gulf coast province our onshore gulf coast province is a high potential  multi pay province that lends itself to d seismic exploration due to its substantial structural and stratigraphic complexity 
in addition  certain sand reservoirs display seismic bright spots  which can be direct hydrocarbon indicators and can result in greatly reduced drilling risk 
however  bright spots are not always reliable as direct hydrocarbon indicators and do not generally assess reservoir productivity 
we believe our established d seismic exploration approach  combined with our exploration staff s extensive experience and accumulated knowledge base in the onshore gulf coast province  provides us with significant competitive advantages 

table of contents key operating trends within this province include the vicksburg trend in brooks county  texas  the miocene and upper oligocene trends in southern louisiana and the frio trend in and around matagorda county  texas 
over the three year period ended december   approximately of our total capital expenditures for drilling  land and seismic were allocated to our onshore gulf coast province  where we completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of 
during  we completed five gross wells net in six attempts for a completion rate of in this province 
four of the five completed wells were development wells 
we also had one exploratory well that was drilling as of december  subsequent to year end  this well was plugged and abandoned 
we operated of the wells that we drilled in this province during for  we spent million on drilling  land and seismic in our onshore gulf coast province 
approximately of the drilling  land and seismic was allocated to the vicksburg  to southern louisiana  to the frio and to other areas in the province 
for  we currently plan to spend million in our onshore gulf coast province 
approximately million of this spending has been allocated to drilling  with the remaining million allocated to capital spending for land and seismic activities 
we anticipate that approximately of the drilling  land and seismic will be allocated to the southern louisiana  to the frio  and to other areas in the province 
vicksburg trend our vicksburg activity is focused principally in brooks county  texas  in our home run  triple crowne  and floyd fields 
we discovered these fields in  and  respectively 
since  we have drilled vicksburg wells and we have completed of those wells 
we believe we have a multi year inventory of proved  probable and possible drilling locations in our home run  triple crown and floyd fault block fields 
subsequent to completing the sullivan c in august  we temporarily halted drilling activity in the vicksburg in order to have time to reprocess our d seismic and update our structural interpretation of the fields 
in february  we resumed our vicksburg drilling program and spud the floyd field sullivan c  a development well  which was an attempt to extend the prolific floyd fault block to the north 
in april  we completed the well 
in june  we successfully completed the sullivan f in our triple crowne field from the dawson sand 
subsequent to the f  we completed the sullivan c in our home run field 
the sullivan c was completed in the vicksburg and lower vicksburg intervals 
the best apparent pay  in the vicksburg and upper intervals  remains behind pipe for future completion 
southern louisiana trend in southern louisiana  we utilize our geophysical  geological and operational expertise to explore for hydrocarbon bearing miocene and oligocene reservoirs 
these reservoirs are generally on trend with the texas gulf coast frio and are therefore logical extensions of our drilling activities 
during  we drilled six wells with drilling  land and seismic expenditures totaling million 
in december  we entered into a joint venture with clayton williams energy inc to operate the drilling of at least five prospects over the subsequent months  earning a working interest 
five prospects were planned for targeting d delineated  primarily amplitude related  prospects at depths of  to  feet in plaquemines and saint bernard parish 

table of contents in july  we announced our first joint venture well  the main pass sl  encountered approximately feet of apparent miocene pay in four intervals at depths of between  and  feet 
all intervals were commingled and commenced production to sales in early december 
our second joint venture well  the chandeleur sound sl  encountered approximately feet of apparent pay 
the chandeleur sound sl was flow tested in july at a rate of approximately mmcf of natural gas per day 
the chandeleur sound well commenced production to sales in january our third joint venture well  the breton sound sl  was logged in july and encountered approximately feet of apparent pay 
approximately feet of the pay has apparent porosities greater than  while feet of apparent pay has porosities ranging from to 
in september  we announced the breton sound sl was production tested at an initial rate of approximately mmcf of natural gas per day 
the breton sound well is expected to commence production to sales in late march or early april 
our fourth joint venture well  the romere pass blm  was plugged and abandoned as the target sands were wet 
our fifth joint venture well  the tiger pass sl  was drilling at year end and was subsequently plugged and abandoned 
in september  we successfully drilled and completed the cotten land  which is a joint venture well with penn virginia corporation 
the cotten land is a twin to our high production rate cotten land discovery and targeted the upper feet of apparent pay which remains behind pipe in the cotten land the cotten land was brought on line in october 
in  we plan to spend approximately million to complete wells in progress at december  and for other activities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital commitments overview of activity 
anadarko basin province the anadarko basin is located in the texas panhandle and western oklahoma 
we believe this prolific natural gas producing province offers a combination of relatively lower risk exploration and development opportunities in shallower horizons  as well as higher risk  but higher reserve potential opportunities in the deeper sections that have been relatively under explored 
we believe our drilling program in the anadarko basin generally provides us with longer life reserves and helps to balance our drilling program in our prolific  but generally shorter reserve life onshore gulf coast province 
the stratigraphic and structural objectives in the anadarko basin can provide excellent targets for d seismic imaging 
in addition  drilling economics in the anadarko basin are enhanced by the multi pay nature of many of the prospects  with secondary or tertiary targets serving as either incremental value or as alternatives if the primary target zone is not productive 
our recent activity has been focused primarily in the hunton  springer channel  springer bar and granite wash trends 
however  we currently do not anticipate spending any drilling capital in the anadarko basin in west texas and other province the permian basin of west texas and eastern new mexico is a predominantly oil producing province with generally longer life reserves than that of our onshore gulf coast 
our drilling activity in our west texas province has been focused primarily in various carbonate reservoirs  including the canyon reef and fusselman formations of the horseshoe atoll trend  the canyon reef of the eastern shelf  the wolfcamp and devonian section of new mexico  and the mississippian reef of the hardeman basin  at depths ranging from  to  feet 
during  we completed four gross well in four attempts for a completion rate and spent a total of million on drilling  land and seismic 
we currently do not anticipate spending any drilling capital in west texas in 
table of contents title to properties we believe we have satisfactory title  in all material respects  to substantially all of our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry 
our properties are subject to royalty interests  standard liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens  which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties 
substantially all of our proved oil and natural gas properties are pledged as collateral for borrowings under our senior credit agreement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources senior credit agreement and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources senior notes due oil and natural gas reserves our estimated total net proved reserves of oil and natural gas as of december   and  pre tax pv value  standardized measure and the estimated future development cost attributable to these reserves as of those dates were as follows

b these base prices were adjusted to reflect applicable transportation and quality differentials on a well by well basis to arrive at realized sales prices used to estimate our reserves at these dates 
the reserve estimates reflected above were prepared by cawley  gillespie associates  inc  our independent petroleum consultants  and are part of reports on our oil and natural gas properties prepared by them 
in accordance with applicable requirements of the securities and exchange commission sec  estimates of our net proved reserves and future net revenues are made using sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date of such reserve estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties except to the extent a contract specifically provides for escalation 
estimated quantities of net proved reserves and future net revenues there from are affected by oil and natural gas prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
however  the sec recently adopted final rules amending its oil and gas reporting requirements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies sec rulemaking 

table of contents there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values  including many factors beyond our control 
the reserve data set forth in the cawley  gillespie associates  inc report represents only estimates 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geologic interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers  including those used by us  may vary 
in addition  estimates of reserves are subject to revision based upon actual production  results of future development and exploration activities  prevailing oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and other factors 
the revisions may be material 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based 
our estimated net proved reserves  included in our sec filings  have not been filed with or included in reports to any other federal agency 
see item a 
risk factors although our oil and gas reserve data is independently estimated  these estimates may still prove to be inaccurate 
estimates with respect to net proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history 
estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history 
subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations in the estimated reserves that may be substantial 
reconciliation of standardized measure to pre tax pv pre tax pv is the estimated present value of the future net revenues from our proved oil and natural gas reserves before income taxes discounted using a discount rate 
pre tax pv is considered a non gaap financial measure under sec regulations because it does not include the effects of future income taxes  as is required in computing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
we believe that pre tax pv is an important measure that can be used to evaluate the relative significance of our oil and natural gas properties and that pre tax pv is widely used by securities analysts and investors when evaluating oil and natural gas companies 
because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid  the use of a pre tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies 
we believe that most other companies in the oil and natural gas industry calculate pre tax pv on the same basis 
pre tax pv is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows but without deducting income taxes 
the table below provides a reconciliation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to our pre tax pv value in millions 
at december  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows add present value of future income tax discounted at fas assumption differences pre tax pv

productive wells and acreage productive wells the following table sets forth our ownership interest at december  in productive oil and natural gas wells in the areas indicated 
wells are classified as oil or natural gas according to their predominant production stream 
gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest  and net wells are determined by multiplying gross wells by our average working interest 
natural gas oil total gross net gross net gross net onshore gulf coast anadarko basin rocky mountains west texas and other total productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production  including wells waiting on pipeline connection
