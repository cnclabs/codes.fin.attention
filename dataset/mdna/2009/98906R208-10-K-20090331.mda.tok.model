item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below and elsewhere in this report on form k and in our other public filings 
the occurrence of one or more of these risks could also materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
if we require additional financing to sustain our operations  and we are unable to obtain it on favorable terms  we may need to significantly curtail operations 
during the year ended december   we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of  and had cash provided by operations of  as of december   we had an excess of current liabilities compared to current assets of million 
our current financing sources are our million revolving credit facility with bank of america  na as successor by merger to lasalle bank national association and a million line of credit with bruno guazzoni  the uncle of our chief executive officer and the owner of approximately of our outstanding common stock 
we also have outstanding promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of million issued to bruno guazzoni 
with respect to the bank of america facility  as of march   the outstanding loan balance was  with available borrowings of  the credit facility matures on december  under the line of credit  which expires on march   the loan balance was  with available borrowings of  as of december  the outstanding promissory notes to mr 
guazzoni have maturity dates in the first quarter of see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our future capital uses and requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which our solutions and services gain market acceptance  the level of revenues from present and future solutions and services  the expansion of operations  the costs and timing of product and service developments and sales and marketing activities  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  and competitive developments 
we may require additional or replacement financing to continue our operations  but such financing could be difficult to secure 
the united states credit markets are currently experiencing an unprecedented contraction 
notwithstanding our existing financing sources and other potential sources of funds  as a result of the tightening credit markets  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if the financial institution that supports our credit facility fails  we may not be able to find a replacement lender 
in addition  if the current pressures on credit continue or worsen  we may not be able to refinance our outstanding debt when it becomes due 
any of these events would have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
current economic conditions and reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 
our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers 
the purchase of our services may be discretionary and may require our customers to make significant commitments of capital 
during the current economic downturn  business spending on information technology has decreased 
continued weak economic conditions  or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions improve  could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flow  particularly through reduced contracts for service and lower prices for our services  difficulty in the collection of our accounts receivable and lower recoverability of assets 
we may experience difficulties in scaling our operations to react to economic pressures in the us in order to continue to increase sales and marketing efforts  to expand and enhance the solutions and services we are able to offer to current and future customers and to fund potential acquisitions  we will require additional capital that may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
as a consequence  we will be required to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative relationships  bank facilities or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  all of which have contracted sharply in recent months 
any additional equity financing is expected to be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants and increased interest costs 
we have financed our operations to date primarily through private sales of equity securities  and loans from related parties and business associates 
in addition  if unforeseen difficulties arise in the course of these capital raising or other aspects of our business  we may be required to spend funds in an amount greater than anticipated 
such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
our inability to obtain sufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our expansion programs or to limit the marketing of our services 
any such disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged 
such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future discretionary uses of cash 
we also continue to explore other ways to maximize the value of the company for its stockholders 
the company has not achieved profitability in each reporting period and may incur net losses in future quarters 
the company has a history of operating losses  including a loss from continuing operations of approximately  for the year ended december  and a loss from continuing operations of approximately million for the year ended december  we may incur additional operating losses in the future 
operating expenses may increase as we seek to grow our business through acquisition and as our existing business expands 
even if we achieve consistent profitability  we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or be able to raise capital in sufficient amounts to enable us to continue to expand our business 
an inability to sustain profitability may also result in an impairment loss in the value of our long lived assets  principally goodwill  property and equipment  and other tangible and intangible assets 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or raise capital in sufficient amounts  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
termination of a contract by a significant customer and or cancellation with short notice  or failure by us to attract new customers and replace customers not renewing their contracts  could reduce our revenue and profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 
for the year ended december   our largest customer accounted for approximately of revenues 
non renewal or termination of contracts with a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a large portion of our revenues were derived from professional services that are generally non recurring in nature 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain additional contracts for projects similar in scope to those previously obtained from our principal customers or any other customer  that we will be able to retain existing customers or attract new customers or that we will not remain largely dependent on a limited customer base  which may continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
in addition  we may be subject to delays in customer funding  non renewal  delay  termination  reduction or modification of contracts in the event of changes in customer policies or as a result of budgetary constraints  and increased or unexpected costs resulting in losses under fixed fee contracts 
our success in meeting growth targets is dependent on our ability to maintain existing clients and to continually attract and retain new customers to replace customers who have not renewed their contracts 
achieving significant market acceptance requires substantial effort and expenditures on our part to create awareness of our services 
an unexpected shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  or significant bad debt experience  could materially and adversely affect our business 
revenues are difficult to forecast 
we may increase our corporate overhead expenses as the number of acquisitions we complete increases and we build an infrastructure to implement our strategy  and will increase overhead to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
meanwhile  our business units may increase their operating expenses for sales  marketing and technical personnel to sell  provide and support their products and services 
additionally  at any given point in time  and especially in the current challenging economic climate  we may have significant accounts receivable balances with customers that expose us to credit risks 
if we have an unexpected shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  or significant bad debt experience  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
it services are subject to uncertain demand due to emerging and evolving markets and technology 
the markets for some of our services are changing rapidly and evolving and  therefore  the ultimate level of demand for our services is subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
any significant decline in demand for programming and applications development and it consulting services could materially adversely affect our business and prospects 
significant technological changes could render our existing products and services obsolete 
to be successful  we must adapt to this rapidly changing market by continually improving the responsiveness  functionality and features of our products and services to meet customers needs 
if we are unable to respond to technological advances and conform to emerging industry standards in a cost effective and timely manner  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
the it services industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
competition for our it solutions is significant  and we expect that competition will continue to intensify due to the low barriers to entry 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise  sales and marketing or support capabilities to successfully meet this competition 
if we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors  our business will be adversely affected 
we compete against numerous large companies that have substantially greater market presence  longer operating histories  more significant customer bases  and financial  technical  facilities  marketing  capital and other resources than we have 
our competitors include national  regional and local it consulting service providers  software development firms and major accounting and consulting firms such as accenture  cap gemini  ernst young  ibm global services  keane  kforce and mps group 
in addition  we also encounter competition from numerous other businesses that provide one or more similar goods or services  including numerous resellers of internet related hardware and software and web site development companies 
our competitors may respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
our competitors may also devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
they may develop products and services that are superior to or have greater market acceptance than ours 
competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to our existing and potential employees and strategic partners 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further impact our ability to effectively compete 
new competitors  including large computer hardware  software  professional services and other technology and telecommunications companies  may enter our markets and rapidly acquire significant market share 
as a result of increased competition and vertical and horizontal integration in the industry  we could encounter significant pricing pressures 
these pricing pressures could result in significantly lower average selling prices for our products and services 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher revenue from consulting services  cost reductions or otherwise 
in addition  professional services businesses are likely to encounter consolidation in the near future  which could result in decreased pricing and other competition 
moreover  there is a high degree of competition among companies seeking to acquire interests in it service companies such as those we have historically targeted for acquisition 
we are and will continue to be a minor participant in the business of seeking business relationships with  and acquisitions of interests in such companies 
a large number of established and  in some cases  well financed entities  including venture capital firms  are active in acquiring interests in companies that we may find desirable acquisition candidates 
many of these investment oriented entities have significantly greater financial resources  technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do 
consequently  we may be at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating and executing possible investments in these entities 
entrepreneur founders of privately held it service companies  including those suffering from the current economic crisis and or facing potential bankruptcy restructuring or liquidation  generally place greater emphasis on gaining access to capital than obtaining the management skills and networking services that we can provide 
even if we are able to successfully compete with these other entities  this competition may affect the terms and conditions of potential acquisitions and  as a result  we may pay more than expected for targeted companies 
if we cannot acquire interests in attractive companies on reasonable terms  our growth by acquisition strategy may not succeed 
operations interruptions caused by systems failures could adversely affect our business 
our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure 
we currently maintain most of our computer systems in our facilities in new york  ny and at business unit offices in needham  ma  stoneham  ma  mason  oh  indianapolis  in  jacksonville  fl  alpharetta  ga and north palm beach  fl 
interruptions could result from natural disasters  as well as power loss  telecommunications failure and similar events 
we also lease telecommunications lines from local and regional carriers  whose service may be interrupted 
any damage or failure that interrupts or delays network operations could materially and adversely affect our business 
security breaches could expose our company to a risk of loss or liability 
our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins  viruses or similar problems 
if a person or entity circumvents our security measures  they could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored on our systems  misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to make significant additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches 
security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate their operations with our own 
a key element of our expansion strategy is to grow through acquisitions 
if we identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make investments or acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms 
acquisitions may cause a disruption of our ongoing business  distract management  require other resources and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures 
we may not be able to retain key employees of the acquired companies or maintain good relations with their customers or suppliers 
we may be required to incur additional debt  if available  and we may be required to issue equity securities  which may be dilutive to existing stockholders  to fund acquisitions 
unsuccessful acquisitions could adversely affect our business 
there can be no assurance that any completed acquisition will enhance our business 
since the normal consideration in our acquisitions comprises both cash and shares of our common stock  if we proceed with one or more significant acquisitions  the potential impacts are a substantial portion of our available cash could be used to consummate the acquisitions and or we could incur or assume significant amounts of additional indebtedness  and our stockholders could suffer significant dilution of their interest in our common stock 
also  acquisitions are required to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  which results in us recording significant amounts of goodwill 
the inability of a subsidiary to sustain profitability may result in an impairment loss in the value of long lived assets associated with that subsidiary  principally goodwill  property and equipment  and other tangible and intangible assets 
our success depends on our retaining key personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the sectors in which we operate 
the loss of existing personnel or the failure to recruit additional qualified managerial  technical  and sales personnel  as well as expenses in connection with hiring and retaining personnel  could adversely affect our business 
we also depend on the performance of our executive officers and key employees  most of whom have not entered into employment agreements 
as of december   we had full time employees 
we will need to attract  train and retain more employees for management  engineering  programming  sales and marketing  and customer service and support positions 
competition for qualified employees  particularly engineers  programmers and consultants continues to be high 
consequently  we may not be successful in attracting  training and retaining the people we need to continue to offer solutions and services to present and future customers in a cost effective manner or at all 
fluctuation in quarterly operating results may negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are within our control 
quarter to quarter comparisons of the results of operations as an indication of future performance should not be relied upon 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our common stock may fall 
factors that could cause quarterly results to fluctuate include change in customer demand for  or the inability of our customers to pay for  our products and services  timing of the expansion of operations  changes in pricing by us or our competitors  introduction of new products or services by competitors or zanett  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  continued or worsening recession or slow down in the us economy  or termination or non renewal of customer contracts 
changes in government regulations may adversely impact our business 
there are an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet 
these laws and regulations relate to liability for information received from or transmitted over the internet  online content regulation  user privacy  taxation and quality of products and services 
the government may also seek to regulate some segments of our activities as basic telecommunications services 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement  copyright  trademark  trade secret  obscenity  libel  employment  personal privacy and other issues is uncertain and developing 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business 
we may be faced with potential claims for liability if we cannot adequately meet our customers expectations 
our services involve development  implementation and maintenance of computer systems and computer software that are critical to the operations of our customers businesses 
our failure or inability to meet a customer s expectations in the performance of our services could harm our business reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for such failure or inability 
in addition  in the course of performing services  our personnel often gain access to technologies and content that includes confidential or proprietary customer information 
any such unauthorized disclosure or use could result in a claim for substantial damages 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are uninsured  exceed available insurance coverage or result in changes to our insurance policies  including premium increases or the imposition of a large deductible or co insurance requirements  could adversely affect us 
we may become subject to legal claims relating to the content in the web sites we may host or in email messages that we transmit 
the law relating to the liability of online service providers  private network operators and internet service providers for information carried on or disseminated through their networks is currently unsettled 
we may become subject to legal claims relating to the content in the web sites we may host or in email messages that we transmit 
for example  lawsuits may be brought against us claiming that material inappropriate for viewing by young children can be accessed from the web sites we may host 
claims could also involve matters such as defamation  invasion of privacy and copyright infringement 
providers of internet products and services have been sued in the past  sometimes successfully  based on the content of material 
if we have to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks  or are required to defend ourselves against such claims  our business may be materially adversely affected 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of future sales by existing stockholders 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales may occur 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to issue equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that it reflects fair value 
as of december   we had granted options to purchase  shares under our stock option plan  as listed below 
the total number of options authorized under the stock option plan  as amended  is  if the holders of these options and any other options we have issued were to exercise their rights and sell the shares issued to them  it could have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
the market price for our common stock has been volatile 
while nasdaq has temporarily suspended its rules requiring a minimum closing bid price and a minimum market value of publicly held shares  if  in the future  we are unable to regain compliance with the nasdaq listing standards  our common stock could be delisted 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of it consulting companies have been especially volatile 
we have not historically paid  and do not anticipate in the foreseeable future paying cash dividends on our common stock 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
instead  we intend to retain future earnings for reinvestment in our business and or to fund future acquisitions 
our credit facility with bank of america prohibits us from declaring or paying any dividends  except for dividends or other distributions made by zcs to us  provided  however  that we may accrue but not pay dividends as payment in kind 
the concentrated ownership of our company may discourage potential transactions involving zanett 
claudio guazzoni  our chief executive officer owned approximately of the outstanding common stock as of march   and in addition  mr 
guazzoni s uncle  bruno guazzoni  owns  as of march   approximately of the outstanding common stock 
as a result  the guazzoni family possesses significant influence over zanett s decision making on business matters  including the election of directors 
the concentration of zanett share ownership may delay or prevent a change in the control of zanett  impede a merger  consolidation  takeover  or other transaction involving our company  or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of zanett 
our rapid growth has strained  and may continue to strain  managerial and operational resources 
our rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on managerial and operational resources 
further  as we grow  we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers  strategic partners and other third parties 
further growth or an increase in the number of strategic relationships may increase this strain on existing managerial and operational resources  inhibiting our ability to successfully implement our strategy without incurring additional corporate expenses 
our future growth is dependent on producing revenue sufficient to cover increasing expenses 
expenses will increase as we build an infrastructure to implement our strategy 
we expect to hire additional employees and expand information technology systems 
we also may increase our operating expenses to broaden our support capabilities for our clients  explore acquisition opportunities and alliances with other companies  and facilitate business arrangements among our business units 
if the higher expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue  our earnings will be lower than anticipated or we may incur losses

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this section also contains forward looking statements and is subject to the disclosure regarding forward looking statements in part i of this report 
versus results of operations revenues grew for the year ended december  to  from  during the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to our organic growth resulting from increased sales headcount and our increased marketing efforts 
in addition  the businesses we acquired subsequent to january  contributed to the year over year increases in revenues and expenses for the year ended december   as follows

acquired business date of acquisition additional contribution to revenues additional contribution to expenses dba march    ps golive november    costs of revenues increased to  during the year ended december   versus  for the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributed to our growth in organic revenue  and also reflected the costs associated with the operations of dba and ps golive 
gross margins in fiscal increased to of revenues from in fiscal in an effort to grow our revenues  selling and marketing expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared with  for we believe the increase in our marketing efforts over the past three years has been instrumental in fueling our organic revenue growth and the improved performance of our acquired companies 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   were  as compared with  during  representing an increase of  or 
this increase in general and administrative costs is primarily related to compensation cost including costs related to the pdi disposition and professional fees related to investor relations and other services 
depreciation and amortization expense for the twelve months ended december  increased to  from  in these increases were slightly offset by reductions in stock based compensation and rent expense 
consolidated net loss income on a consolidated basis  the increase in operating expenses partly offset the effect of the increases in revenue resulting in an operating gain of  for the year ended december   as compared to an operating loss of  for the year ended december  net interest expense for the year was  compared to  in the decrease was attributable to a decrease in borrowings in versus resulting from the pay down of debt as a result of the pdi transaction 
our interest expense was also lower because of the decrease of the prime rate in versus our loss from continuing operations before income taxes was  for the year ended december   as compared to a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  we recorded an income tax provision of  for the year ended december   compared to a benefit of  for loss from the discontinued operations of pdi net of tax was  for the year ended december  as compared to income from discontinued operation of  for the year ended december  in addition  we recorded a  gain on the sale of pdi for the year ended december  the company tax basis exceeds the gain and therefore there is no tax effect 
pdi was classified as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of and sold in the first quarter of as a result of all of the above  for the year ended december   we reported a consolidated net income of  critical accounting policies and significant use of estimates in the company s financial statements in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction in conformity with gaap is specifically dictated  with little or no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
however  the preparation of gaap financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion reviews the critical accounting policies and items incorporated in the company s financial statements that required the use of significant management estimates 
the following listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of zanett s accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified revenue recognition  stock based compensation  purchase accounting  and the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles as critical accounting policies of the company 
revenue recognition the company earns revenue primarily from it professional services 
revenues from contracts for consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab  revenue recognition 
we consider revenue to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
revenues from fixed fee contracts for professional services are recognized using contract accounting based on the estimated percentage of completion 
the percentage of completion for each contract is determined based on the ratio of costs incurred to a current estimate of total project costs since management believes this reflects the extent of contract completion 
changes in estimated costs during the course of a fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which such facts become known 
if such changes indicate that a loss may be realized on a contract  the entire loss is recorded at such time 
on occasion  certain contracts may have substantive customer acceptance provisions 
in such cases  revenue is recognized upon receipt of acceptance from the customer 
out of pocket expenses incurred during the performance of professional service contracts are included in costs of revenues and any amounts re invoiced to customers are included in revenue during the period in which they are incurred 
unbilled revenue represents revenue for which services have been performed and costs incurred that have not yet been invoiced to the customer 
stock based compensation the company has entered into several transactions involving the issuance of shares of restricted common stock and options to purchase shares of restricted common stock to independent contractors 
the issuance of these securities required management to estimate their value using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires management to make certain estimates for values of variables used by the model 
management estimated the values for stock price volatility  the expected life of the equity instruments and the risk free rate based on information that was available to management at the time the black scholes option pricing calculations were performed 
purchase accounting in connection with its acquisitions  the company allocates the total acquisition costs to all tangible and intangible assets acquired and all liabilities assumed  with the excess purchase price recorded to goodwill 
to arrive at the allocation of the total purchase price  management makes certain assumptions in estimating the fair market value of the acquired companies tangible assets  intangible assets such as customer lists  and long term contracts and liabilities 
evaluating the carrying value of goodwill goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the assessment requires the comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the company s reporting units to the carrying value of their respective net assets  including allocated goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company must perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized by the company in an amount equal to that excess 
the estimation of fair values of each reporting unit is based on assumptions and estimates prepared by management which are highly subjective 
intangibles and long lived assets intangibles and long lived assets are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization  which is provided for by charges to income on a basis consistent with the utilization of the assets over their useful lives 
the carrying value of intangible and long lived assets is reviewed periodically by the company for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment 
if such circumstances exist  the company estimates the future  undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset  and compare that to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
the cost of intangibles is based on the estimated fair values calculated as of the date of acquisition of the related company 
such estimates are based on highly subjective estimates made by management 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of  representing a decrease of  from the december  year end balance of  this decrease was primarily a result of paying down our loan balances 
cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to cash used in operating activities of  in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improvements in our operating results and a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of our revenue growth  offset by a reduction in accounts payable

on march   the company and our operating subsidiaries replaced four other existing promissory notes that had been issued to bruno guazzoni in the aggregate principal amount of  with notes containing identical terms except for the extension of the maturity dates to march  as of december  the aggregate principal amount was  management will continue to monitor the company s cash position carefully and evaluate its future operating cash requirements with respect to its strategy  business objectives and performance 
however  due to scheduled debt maturity the company requires additional capital or other sources of financing in order to meet its commitments 
if necessary we will explore other sources of capital  to fund future acquisitions and provide additional working capital 
we are also exploring other opportunities that may be available to maximize the company s value for its stockholders  including strategic transactions 
as a result of the extraordinary tightening of the credit and equity markets  it may be difficult for us to secure such additional liquidity sources on favorable terms or at all 
if we cannot secure additional funding  we will be unable to finance our acquisition strategy and or continue our organic growth 
further  due to the recent trading price of our common stock and the possibility of nasdaq delisting our common stock if we do not regain compliance with minimum listing standards of the nasdaq capital market  completion of a financing could be more difficult and could result in dilution to the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
to further minimize cash outlays  we expect to continue to supplement compensation for both existing and new employees with equity incentives where possible 
we believe that this strategy provides the ability to increase stockholder value  as well as utilize cash resources more effectively 
to support this strategy  the stockholders of the company  at its annual meeting in june  approved an amendment to the zanett  inc incentive stock plan stock plan that increased the number of equity securities that can be issued under the plan from  shares to  shares 
while this increase allows us greater flexibility in its use of stock based compensation  the issuance of equity securities under the stock plan may result in dilution to existing stockholders 
moreover  if we are unable to regain compliance with nasdaq s minimum listing requirements  we will be unable to continue this compensation practice 
the company s board of directors reauthorized a stock repurchase plan effective march  that allows us to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock from time to time in open market transactions

the company enters into many contractual and commercial undertakings during the normal course of business 
also  all of our acquisitions were structured with additional contingent purchase price obligations that may be payable if the subsidiaries achieve certain annual performance requirements 
the company s liquidity could also be impacted by its concentration of credit risk associated with its bank accounts and accounts receivable  as follows we maintain our cash balances and money market instruments with three separate institutions which we believe are of high credit quality to minimize our exposure 
however  these deposits are subject to federal deposit insurance limits 
we believe that any credit risk associated with our receivables is minimal due to the size and credit worthiness of our customers  which are principally large domestic corporations 
however  the uncertainty of the current economic climate affects our level of assurance regarding any of our customers financial well being 
during  no one customer accounted for more than of revenues 
during  one customer accounted for approximately of revenues 
at december  and december   the company did not have a customer account that accounted for over of accounts receivable

fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for and asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets of liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities
