the increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a million increase in net income  including changes in i depreciation and amortization expense  ii deferred tax expense benefit  and iii realized and unrealized losses gains on investments 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures for satellite construction  and equipment under our lease program for existing subscribers  partially offset by decreased spending for equipment under our lease program for new subscribers 
cash flows from operating activities 
we typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash flows from operating activities of billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
see discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in free cash flow above 
cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities  strategic investments and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  capital expenditures for new and existing customer equipment totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of million primarily resulted from a net decrease in purchases of marketable investment securities  a decrease in cash used for purchases of property and equipment  a decrease in cash used for the purchases of strategic investments  including sling media  and an increase in proceeds from the sale of investments 
the overall net decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash used for purchases of fcc authorizations during compared to the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of million primarily resulted from an increase in cash used for the purchases of strategic investments  including sling media  fcc licenses and capital expenditures  partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of marketable investment securities during cash flows from financing activities 
our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt  cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt  payment of capital lease obligations  mortgages or other notes payable  and repurchases of our class a common stock 
for the years ended december  and  we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of billion and million  respectively

we paid million to acquire certain mhz wireless licenses  which were granted to us by the fcc in february we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others to commercialize these licenses and satisfy fcc build out requirements 
part or all of our licenses may be terminated if we fail to satisfy these requirements 
subscriber churn 
dish network lost approximately  net subscribers for the year ended december   compared to adding approximately  net new subscribers during the same period in this decrease primarily resulted from the decrease in gross new subscribers and an increase in our subscriber churn rate of compared to for the same period in see results of operations above for further discussion 
our distribution relationship with at t was a substantial contributor to our gross and net subscriber additions over the past several years  accounting for approximately of our gross subscriber additions for the year ended december  and of our gross subscriber additions in the fourth quarter 
this distribution relationship ended on january  at t has entered into a new distribution relationship with directv 
it may be difficult for us to develop alternative distribution channels that will fully replace at t and if we are unable to do so  our gross and net subscriber additions may be further impaired  our subscriber churn may increase  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  approximately one million of our current subscribers were acquired through our distribution relationship with at t and subscribers acquired through this channel have historically churned at a higher rate than our overall subscriber base 
although at t is not permitted to target these subscribers for transition to another pay tv service and we and at t are required to maintain bundled billing and cooperative customer service for these subscribers  these subscribers may still churn at higher than historical rates following termination of the at t distribution relationship 
satellites 
operation of our subscription television service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer 
moreover  current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming  particularly by expanding local hd coverage and offering more hd national channels 
while we generally have had in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming  our backup capacity is limited 
in the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites  we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite 
such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity 
security systems 
increases in theft of our signal  or our competitors signals  could in addition to reducing new subscriber activations  also cause subscriber churn to increase 
we use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards  called smart cards  or security chips in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content 
our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures  such as security access device replacement programs and updates in security software  that are intended to make signal theft more difficult 
it has been our prior experience that security measures may be only effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content 
during the third quarter of  we began implementing a plan to replace our existing security access devices to re secure our system  which is expected to take approximately nine to twelve months to complete 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our security access device replacement plan is not effective 
stock repurchases 
our board of directors previously authorized stock repurchases of up to billion of our class a common stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million 
in november  our board of directors extended the plan and authorized an increase in the maximum dollar value of shares that may be repurchased under the plan  such that we are authorized to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding shares through and including december  as of december   we may repurchase up to million under this plan 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued subscriber acquisition and retention costs 
we incur significant up front costs to acquire subscribers  including advertising  retailer incentives  equipment  installation  and new customer promotions 
while we attempt to recoup these up front costs over the lives of their subscription  there can be no assurance that we will 
we deploy business rules such as higher credit requirements and contractual commitments  and we strive to provide outstanding customer service  to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their dish network service over longer periods of time 
our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period 
we incur significant costs to retain our existing customers  mostly by upgrading their equipment to hd and dvr receivers 
as with our subscriber acquisition costs  our retention spending includes the cost of equipment and installation 
we also offer free programming and or promotional pricing for limited periods for existing customers in exchange for a commitment 
a major component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move 
our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other 
we are also vulnerable to fraud  particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers 
while we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions  including eliminating certain payment options for subscribers  such as the use of pre paid debit cards  there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud which could impact our subscriber growth and churn 
the current economic downturn may create greater incentive for signal thefts and subscriber frauds  which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued satellite related obligations satellites under construction 
as of december   we had entered into the following contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next two years 
future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under satellite related obligations except where noted below 
echostar xiv 
during  we entered into a contract for the construction of echostar xiv  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be completed during echostar xv 
in april  we entered into a contract for the construction of echostar xv  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be completed during although the table above includes future commitments related to both the echostar xiv and echostar xv satellites discussed above  it only includes the cost associated with one launch contract 
these amounts will increase when we contract for the launch of the second satellite 
in addition  we have agreed to lease capacity on two satellites from echostar which are currently under construction 
future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under satellite related obligations 
nimiq in march  we entered into a transponder service agreement with echostar to lease capacity on nimiq  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be completed during quetzsat in november  we entered into a transponder service agreement with echostar to lease capacity on quetzsat  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be completed during in certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed 
these amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction  launch or lease of additional satellites 
capital lease obligations anik f anik f  an fss satellite  was launched and commenced commercial operation during april we have leased all ku band fss transponders on anik f for a period of years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases sfas  we have accounted for the satellite component of this agreement as a capital lease see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under capital lease obligations in the table above 
the commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slot and other executory costs are included under satellite related obligations in the table above 
the commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under interest on long term debt in the table above

ciel ii  a canadian dbs satellite  was launched in december and commenced commercial operation at the degree orbital location in february our initial ten year term lease for of the capacity on the satellite has been accounted for as a capital lease upon commencement of commercial operation in february as of december   the commitment related to this agreement is included under satellite related obligations in the table above 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued satellite insurance we currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own 
we do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure 
while we generally have had in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming  our backup capacity is limited 
in the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites  we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite 
purchase obligations our purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for receiver systems and related equipment  digital broadcast operations  satellite and transponder leases  engineering and for products and services related to the operation of our dish network 
our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content 
our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to  among other things  management s control of inventory levels  and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements 
programming contracts in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content 
these programming commitments are not included in the contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements table 
the terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases 
our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base 
in addition  our margins may face further downward pressure from price escalations in current contracts and the renewal of long term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms 
future capital requirements we expect to fund our future working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations  existing cash and marketable investment securities balances  and cash generated through new additional capital 
the amount of capital required to fund our future working capital and capital expenditure needs varies  depending on  among other things  the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention  including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs 
the amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives  including our plans to expand our national and local hd offerings and other strategic opportunities that may arise from time to time 
our capital expenditures vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time  and could increase materially as a result of increased competition  significant satellite failures  or continued general economic downturn 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future 
from time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that may complement our current services and products  enhance our technical capabilities  improve or sustain our competitive position  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
we may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video  data and voice services 
future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital  assume third party debt or incur other long term obligations 
we paid million to acquire certain mhz wireless licenses  which were granted to us by the fcc in february we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others to commercialize these licenses and satisfy fcc build out requirements 
part or all of our licenses may be terminated for failure to satisfy these requirements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued recent developments in the financial markets have made it more difficult for issuers of high yield indebtedness  such as us  to access capital markets at acceptable terms 
these developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position 
a portion of our investment portfolio is invested in asset backed securities  auction rate securities  mortgage backed securities  special investment vehicles and strategic investments and as a result a portion of our portfolio has restricted liquidity 
liquidity in the markets for these investments has been impaired in the past year and these market conditions have adversely affected our liquidity 
in addition  certain of these securities have defaulted or have been materially downgraded  causing us to record impairment charges 
if the credit ratings of these securities further deteriorate or the lack of liquidity in the marketplace becomes prolonged  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
moreover  the current significant volatility of domestic and global financial markets has greatly affected the volatility and value of our marketable investment securities 
to the extent we require access to funds  we may need to sell these securities under unfavorable market conditions  record further impairment charges and fall short of our financing needs 
credit ratings our current credit ratings are ba and bb on our long term senior notes as rated by moody s investor service moody s and standard and poor s s p rating service  respectively 
debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agency s opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due 
according to moody s  a ba rating indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk 
according to s p s  a bb rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues 
however  the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial  or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
management bases its estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation  judgment and complexity 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
capitalized satellite receivers 
since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our subscriber equipment lease programs  we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale 
such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment  which is based on  among other things  management s judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence 
because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate  the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on  among other things  historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions 
accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold debt and equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fair value of financial instruments 
fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time  based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the financial instrument 
illiquid credit markets have resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments 
as a result  there is no or limited observable market data for these instruments 
fair value estimates for financial instruments for which no or limited observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions  liquidity discounts  currency  credit and interest rate risks  loss experience and other factors 
these estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision 
as a result  such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique  including discount rates  liquidity risks  and estimate of future cash flows  could significantly affect these fair value estimates  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
acquisition of investments in non marketable investment securities 
we calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either as consideration given  or for non cash acquisitions  based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or dcf model 
the dcf methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
we evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually  and also when events and circumstances warrant 
we use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment  if any  of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors 
however  past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections 
inventory allowance 
management estimates the amount of allowance required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience  the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors 
however  past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include  among other things  estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued volatility of our common stock price over the expected term volatility  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation 
income taxes 
our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow the guidelines set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required 
determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
in accordance with sfas  we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence  including trends  and future expectations in each reporting period 
future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits  or reversals of valuation allowances  as reported in our consolidated results of operations 
uncertainty in tax positions 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
management evaluates the recognition and measurement of the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law  regulations  case law  administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our income tax expense  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
contingent liabilities 
a significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual 
estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
new accounting pronouncements revised business combinations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas and establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
we expect sfas r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  but the character and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the type  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date of january  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas also establishes reporting requirements for providing 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
seasonality historically  the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year  as is typical in the pay tv service industry 
however  we can not provide assurance that this will continue in the future 
inflation inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years 
we believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures 
backlog we do not have any material backlog of our products

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments our investments are exposed to interest rate and equity price risks  discussed below 
interest rate risk cash and marketable securities 
as of december   our restricted and unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and current and noncurrent marketable investment securities had a fair value of million 
of that amount  a total of million was invested in a cash  b debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  c commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  d instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper described above  and e auction rate securities ars  mortgage backed securities mbs and asset backed securities 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to  among other things  fund operations  make strategic investments and expand the business 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business 
our investments in auction rate securities ars and mortgage backed securities mbs are reported at fair value 
recent events in the credit markets have reduced or eliminated current liquidity for certain of our ars and mbs investments 
as a result  effective in  we classify these investments as noncurrent assets as we intend to hold these investments until they recover or mature 
as of december   all of the million was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments 
the value of these investments can be impacted by interest rate fluctuations  but while an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments  we normally hold these investments to maturity 
further  the value could be lowered by credit losses should economic conditions worsen 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended december  of 
a decrease in interest rates does have the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature 
a hypothetical decrease in average interest rates during would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual interest income 
in general  our marketable investment securities portfolio includes debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes 
as of december   we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of million 
these investments  which are concentrated in a small number of companies  are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility 
the fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally  as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in  risks associated with specific industries  and other factors 
these investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio 
fixed rate debt  mortgages and other notes payable 
at december   we had fixed rate debt  mortgages and other notes payable of billion on our consolidated balance sheets 
we estimated the fair value of this debt to be approximately billion using quoted market prices for our publicly traded debt  which constitutes approximately of our debt  and an analysis based on certain assumptions discussed below for our private debt 
in completing our analysis for our private debt  we evaluate market conditions  related securities  various public and private offerings  and other publicly available information 
in performing this analysis  we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads  volatility  and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes 
the fair value of our debt is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a hypothetical decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately million 
to the extent interest rates increase  our costs of financing would 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt 
as of december   a hypothetical increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
equity risk other investments 
we are exposed to equity risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our other investments which totaled million as of december  we invest in equity instruments of public and private companies for operational and strategic business purposes 
these securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to volatility of the stock market and the industry in which the companies operate 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of these equity instruments would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of the portfolio 
our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans 
because private markets are not as liquid as public markets  there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments  or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them 
derivative financial instruments in general  we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes  but we may do so in the future
