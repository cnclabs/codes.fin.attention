our competitive advantages include broad product portfolio 
seracare offers a comprehensive portfolio of biological materials and services for diagnostic and biopharmaceutical applications 
the breadth of our product portfolio enhances our ability to establish and maintain relationships with both large and small companies 
these relationships lead to additional opportunities to develop new products and provide scientific  manufacturing and biobanking services  and thus to position ourselves as the one stop shop for many of these companies biological products and service needs 
expertise and experience 
we continue to explore innovative solutions to meet the needs of evolving technology 
seracare scientists developed and manufactured the first and for many years the only food and drug administration fda licensed confirmatory test for hiv and produced the first commercially available seroconversion panels for hiv  hepatitis b virus hbv  hcv and west nile virus wnv 
these panels are important tools for studying early infection and the human immune response 
seracare s biobanking and repository services have set the standard in this expanding field 
the company continues to innovate  developing a new product line of genetic controls that include controls for diagnostic testing of warfarin sensitivity and controls for thrombophilia testing which were recently launched 
extensive quality assurance programs 
our customers often require vendor pre approval and certification to purchase biological materials and often perform audits of vendor facilities with extensive review of quality documentation 
seracare is a vendor approved supplier to many large pharmaceutical and ivd companies  and these relationships provide access to sell additional products and services 
to build on these relationships  seracare continues to develop and maintain its quality assurance programs 
all of our facilities have international organization for standardization iso and certifications 
seracare s manufacturing facilities operate under the fda s current good manufacturing practices cgmp and its research facilities operate under good laboratory practices glp 
comprehensive manufacturing capabilities 
seracare has fully integrated its manufacturing capabilities  which allows us to control our processes from acquisition of raw materials to shipment of finished products 
our fluid processing capabilities range from a few milliliters to hundreds of liters  all managed with the same attention to quality 
in addition to our own branded products  the company can rapidly manufacture customized products that meet a wide range of specifications 
customers purchase products and services from us instead of sourcing them internally largely because these products involve processing plasma or other biological fluids  or require complex manufacturing processes  
table of contents unique or isolated facilities  specialized test requirements to meet specifications and enhanced quality control procedures 
seracare can safely and efficiently manufacture high quality products that incorporate cultured cells or viruses  reduce infectivity  involve high volume processing of dna samples or isolation of specific cells from human blood 
extensive raw material sourcing capabilities and relationships 
many products we develop and manufacture require raw materials such as human plasma or human tissue samples 
we have established relationships with plasma center operators  blood banks  hospitals  clinical laboratories and physicians that facilitate continued access to these necessary biological materials 
through an innovative outreach program idonateplasma 
com  we recruit plasma donors who have rare antibodies or dna variations to provide these plasma components for specialized products 
seracare protects the privacy of its donors and adheres to all federal and local regulations 
principal business segments the company s business is divided into two segments diagnostic biopharmaceutical products and bioservices 
seracare s diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment includes two types of products controls and panels  which include the manufacture of products used for the evaluation and quality control of infectious disease testing in hospital and clinical testing labs and blood banks  and by in vitro diagnostic ivd manufacturers  and reagents and bioprocessing products  which include the manufacture and supply of biological materials used in the research  development and manufacturing of human and animal diagnostics  therapeutics and vaccines 
the bioservices segment includes biobanking  sample processing and testing services for research and clinical trials  and contract research services in molecular biology  virology  immunology and biochemistry 
a summary of our revenue  earnings from operations and assets for our principal business segments is found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a discussion of factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in risk factors in item a 
diagnostic biopharmaceutical products we develop  manufacture and sell biological products essential for the development  manufacture and use of diagnostic tests and the discovery  development and production of pharmaceuticals and other commercial products 
customers depend on us for a reliable supply of products with exacting specifications that meet stringent fda and other regulatory standards 
our products business has two primary product groups controls and panels for clinical laboratories  blood banks and ivd manufacturers  and reagents and bioprocessing products for use in the discovery  development and manufacturing processes for drugs  vaccines and diagnostic tests 
controls and panels our diagnostic control and panel products are sold to hospital laboratories  independent clinical laboratories  public health laboratories  blood banks  ivd manufacturers and government regulatory and research agencies 
hospital  clinical and public health labs use our quality control products to ensure the accuracy of tests used to detect markers of disease or monitor infection rates 
our control and panel products make it possible for clinical labs testing for infectious diseases to evaluate tests and to independently monitor the quality and precision of test results 
for blood banks and transplant centers  use of quality control products helps to ensure blood and organ safety 
seracare controls and panels have led the market for quality control and evaluation of infectious disease test methods for over a decade and we are expanding this product line into the market for controls and panels for genetic and cancer marker tests 
our control and panel products are also used for employee training and competency assessment programs 
laboratory testing for viruses that cause disease requires highly complex techniques that are frequently revised and improved 
laboratory regulations and good practice require that newly hired technicians must undergo training on test methods and existing personnel must undergo annual competency assessments on each laboratory test they perform 
the clinical laboratories improvement act of clia  for example  requires that laboratories maintain records of their employee training and competency assessment activities 

table of contents controls also called quality controls are samples designed to be similar to patient samples and are provided to laboratories so that a known sample can be tested when a diagnostic test is run 
control results are monitored over time to track test results and ensure their consistent performance 
the use of controls with clinical lab tests is mandated by regulatory agencies in much of the developed world 
panels are also designed to be similar to patient samples 
panels include a data sheet and a set of samples that are related in some way 
for example  they may all be positive for the same marker of hcv or may all be from the same donor at different points in time in the progression of their infection 
these panels have high and lasting value because the samples they contain are highly characterized and can be used to establish a consistent reference point 
the same panel can be purchased repeatedly and used to build a record of improving test sensitivity and specificity over time as new methods are developed 
ivd manufacturers  regulatory agencies and researchers use our panels to develop and evaluate new tests and look for new markers of disease 
we currently offer over control and panel products for infectious diseases including hiv  hepatitis a  hbv  hcv  west nile virus  chagas and hpv  that are widely used around the world 
most of our control products are sold under the accurun brand name and our panel products are called seroconversion and performance panels 
reagents and bioprocessing products our reagents and bioprocessing products are used by diagnostic  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations in industry and academia 
these products make it possible for our customers to optimize consistency in the discovery  development and manufacturing of diagnostic tests  therapeutics and vaccines 
seracare s products are integral components of product development from research through validated production processes filed with regulatory agencies in the us and around the world 
products in this segment include diagnostic intermediates  cell culture additives and media  therapeutic grade albumin  and purified viable human cells 
seracare s diagnostic intermediates are plasma derived products used by manufacturers of diagnostic test kits in every stage of product life cycle  including research and development  pilot production  clinical trials  regulatory submission  full production and commercialization 
these products include bovine serum albumin  human disease state plasma  normal human serum or plasma and basematrix  seracon or matribase  which are clear  stable and economical substitutes for normal human plasma or serum 
we also provide bovine serum albumin which can function as a carrier or stabilizer for other proteins in diagnostic test components 
other seracare human and animal sera products are used in clinical or veterinary laboratory tests as positive and negative controls 
critical raw materials such as diluents  plasma and blood or blood components from individuals with any of a number of specific diseases are a specialty of our diagnostic intermediates group 
our expertise in processing blood products yields consistent results and allows our manufacturing customers to concentrate on test method development and production and distribution of test kits

our biochemistry group provides protein purification services and coagulation testing services 
these services are usually conducted under contracts which range from a few months to multi year commitments and are structured on a cost plus  time and materials or fixed price basis 
product development our research scientists work closely with sales  marketing  manufacturing  quality  regulatory and finance personnel to identify and prioritize the development of new products and services specifically geared to customer needs and consistent with our business priorities 
product launch involves careful coordination among product development  manufacturing  quality assurance  and sales and marketing departments to ensure the final product is produced in accordance with specifications and meets customer requirements 
we are developing ivd and immunology reagents and enabling technologies for our life science customers to use in the discovery  development and manufacture of their diagnostic and therapeutic products 
within ivd we are developing enabling technologies for use in our contract services and manufacturing business  molecular diagnostic controls for emerging infectious disease and for genetic and oncology markers  expression systems for control template packaging and recombinant protein production  and signal detection technologies 
immunology projects include the development of purified and preserved t cell  b cell  nk and monocyte products  extensions to our existing product lines and service capabilities  and developing new antibody  cytokine and research target reagents 
our human and animal derived reagent sourcing acumen supplemented by our cellular  viral and bacterial culture expertise allows seracare to develop value added reagents and enabling technologies that serve to accelerate and enhance the quality  consistency and scalability of our life science customers research  development and manufacturing activities 
suppliers while there are some materials that we obtain from a single supplier  we are not dependent on any one supplier or group of suppliers for our business as a whole 
raw materials are generally available from a number of suppliers 
our normal contract terms are fob seracare s dock with payment terms of days 
sales and distribution we sell most of our products and services through our direct sales force  although we use distributors in approximately countries to market and sell our products in international markets 
these independent distributors may also market products of other companies  including some products that are competitive with our products 
as of september   we employed people worldwide in our sales  customer service and marketing organizations 

table of contents our sales strategy is to employ technical sales representatives who have an extensive background in the life sciences industry 
a thorough knowledge of biological techniques and an understanding of the research process allow our sales representatives to become advisors  acting in a consultative role with customers 
our use of skilled technical sales representatives also enables us to identify evolving market needs and new technologies that we can license and develop into new products

for the year ended september   our top five customers accounted for of our revenue and our largest two customers  national institutes of health nih and roche molecular systems accounted for and of revenue  respectively 
no other customer individually accounted for more than of revenue in that period 
discontinued operations on march   we sold some assets as well as the assumption of some limited liabilities of our genomics collaborative division to bioserve biotechnologies limited bioserve 
the genomics collaborative division was located in cambridge  massachusetts and involved the sale of human clinical specimens and their accompanying medical information for use in drug discovery 
the consideration for this sale consisted of million cash and a royalty on bioserve s net sales related to the business of the genomics collaborative division for five years through march  during the year ended september   the company received million related to the royalties 
the company is actively pursuing collections of additional royalty amounts due but has not recorded a receivable due to collectability concerns 
domestic and foreign sales one of the company s principal marketing strategies has been to target international markets  including europe  asia  canada and other parts of the world 
most of the company s international order processing  invoicing  collection and customer service functions are handled directly from the company s headquarters in massachusetts 
seracare believes demand for the company s products in international markets is primarily driven by increased use of quality control products and the development  validation and use of new diagnostic tests 
in fiscal  of seracare s revenue  or million  was attributable to international sales  of which was from sales to europe  was from sales to asia  and was from sales to canada 
in fiscal and  and  respectively  of seracare s revenue were attributable to international sales 
the increase in international sales from fiscal to fiscal is a result of an increased focus on foreign markets 
the decrease in international sales from fiscal to fiscal is due to lower sales of therapeutic grade human serum albumin products as the company switched suppliers in late as its previous supply agreement was not renewed 
during the last three years  less than of our assets have been located outside of the united states 
licensing arrangements seracare has three non exclusive licensing agreements with the nih  one of which expired during the year ended september  and was not renewed 
these agreements provide seracare with access to certain nih cell lines that are used in the manufacture of certain bulk  control or panel products 
seracare has royalty obligations under each of these agreements 
the company owed approximately million in total to the nih under the three agreements on net sales generated during the fiscal year ended september  
table of contents seracare also has a non exclusive licensing agreement with millipore corporation millipore under which millipore pays for use of hybridoma cell lines that are proprietary to seracare 
the cell lines generate monoclonal antibodies used in millipore s products 
under the agreement  millipore is obligated to pay seracare of net sales generated by related products 
the company received approximately million from millipore under this agreement during the fiscal year ended september  intellectual property we rely on trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to preserve our competitive position 
we rely primarily on know how in many of our manufacturing processes and techniques not generally known to other life sciences companies for developing and maintaining our market position 
we rely on trade secrets  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our intellectual property rights pertaining to our products  technology and clinical research data 
we have trademarks registered in the united states and a number of other countries for use in connection with our products and business 
we believe that many of our trademarks are generally recognized in our industry 
such trademarks include accurun and seracare 
regulatory environment regulation of health care industry the health care industry is highly regulated  and state and federal health care laws and regulations are applicable to certain aspects of our business and that of our customers 
for example  there are federal and state health care laws and regulations that apply to the operation of clinical laboratories  the provision of health care services by providers using our products and services  business relationships between health care providers and suppliers  the privacy and security of health information and the conduct of clinical research 
regulation of products the design and manufacturing of many of our products is regulated by numerous third parties  including the fda  foreign governments  independent standards auditors and our customers 
in the united states  ivd and biological products have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies  primarily as to product safety  efficacy  manufacturing  advertising  labeling  import  export and safety reporting 
the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the fda through its center for devices and radiological health and its center for biological evaluation and research continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation for fda clearance of current and new ivd and biologic products 
the fda can ban certain ivd and biological products  detain or seize adulterated or misbranded ivd and biological products  order repair  replacement or refund of these products  and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to ivd and biological products that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health 
the fda may also enjoin and restrain certain violations of the food  drug and cosmetic act  the safe medical device act or the public health service act pertaining to ivd and biological products or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations 
seracare products sold in europe for blood and diagnostic testing are ce marked 
ce marking is a manufacturer s declaration that the product is in compliance with the essential health and safety requirements set out in european directives 
ce marking allows the product to be legally placed on the market in the participating country and ensures a product s free movement within the european union 
regulation of laboratory operations the company operates a clinical laboratory at its gaithersburg  maryland facility 
clinical laboratories that perform laboratory testing except for research purposes only on human subjects are subject to regulation under clia 
clia regulates clinical laboratories by requiring that the laboratory be certified by the federal 
table of contents government  licensed by the state and comply with various operational  personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical laboratory test results are accurate  reliable and timely 
state law and regulations also apply to the operation of clinical laboratories 
although the company does not engage in significant laboratory testing for purposes other than research  it maintains a clia certification at the gaithersburg  maryland facility and its laboratories are subject to regulation under state law 
environmental seracare is subject to a variety of federal  state and local environmental protection measures 
seracare believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
seracare s compliance with these regulations did not have during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures  cash flows  earnings or competitive position 
occupational safety and health administration osha as with most operating companies  our manufacturing facilities must comply with both federal and state osha regulations 
we maintain all required records 
osha does inspect operating locations as it deems appropriate and generally does so without advance notice 
state governments most states in which we operate have regulations that parallel federal regulations 
most states conduct periodic unannounced inspections and require licensing under such state s procedures 
competitors the segments of the life sciences industry in which we compete are highly fragmented 
within our product and service areas  we face varying levels of competition 
in certain instances  we compete with large  well capitalized life science companies  which have significant financial  operational  sales and marketing  and research and development resources 
in other instances  our competition comes from small  independent companies that focus on particular niches within our segments 
we compete primarily on quality  breadth of product line and service 
diagnostic biopharmaceutical products our primary competitors in the controls and panels business include acrometrix  zeptometrix corporation and bio rad laboratories  inc within the reagents and bioprocessing products business  we compete with other companies  such as millipore  invitrogen corporation  thermo fisher scientific  inc  baxter healthcare corporation and grifols sa  that supply biologics to support the development and manufacture of diagnostic assays  biopharmaceutical products and vaccines  as well as with small private companies  which source human disease state plasma 
bioservices in our biobanking division  we compete with thermo fisher scientific  inc and other companies that maintain biorepositories for commercial organizations  government and academic institutions as well as companies  government agencies and academic institutions that internally maintain their own repository for biological materials 
employees as of september   we employed full time and four part time employees 
none of our employees are represented by labor unions and we have not entered into any collective bargaining agreements 
chapter reorganization on december   the company reported that it was unable  without unreasonable effort and expense  to file its annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  within the prescribed time period which triggered the notice of default and acceleration of debt from its senior secured lenders and the cross default of another secured debt facility 
the default was due to the violation of certain financial covenants and the failure to deliver annual audited financial statements on a timely basis 
the 
table of contents company was unable to reach an agreement with its senior lenders  union bank of california and brown brothers harriman co  and was forced to seek bankruptcy protection to allow time to work out agreements with its secured and unsecured creditors under the supervision of the bankruptcy court 
on march   the company filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of california the bankruptcy court 
subsequently  the bankruptcy court allowed the company to operate its business as a debtor in possession under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code  the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure and the orders of the bankruptcy court 
the company emerged from bankruptcy protection under the joint plan of reorganization the plan of reorganization which was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on february  and after each of the conditions precedent to the consummation was satisfied or waived  became effective may  the plan of reorganization allowed seracare to pay off all its creditors in full and exit bankruptcy under the ownership of its existing shareholders and provided for the settlement of seracare s alleged liabilities in a previously filed shareholders class action lawsuit 
accordingly  each of the revolving term credit and security agreement between the company  union bank of california and brown brothers harriman co 
and the subordinated note agreement between the company  barry plost  bernard kasten and jacob safier were terminated and the principal amount and interest outstanding under each agreement was paid off with the proceeds of million from a rights offering in may all items under the plan of reorganization were completed by september  available information our principal executive offices are located at birch street  milford  massachusetts and our telephone number is our website address is www

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and other information in this annual report 
our business  financial condition  and operating results could be seriously harmed if any of these risks materialize 
the trading price of our common stock may also decline due to any of these risks 
risks related to our business quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate in future periods  and the company may fail to meet investor expectations 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors  the price of our common stock 
table of contents could decline significantly 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in revenue and operating results include the following changes in demand for the company s products and services  and the ability to obtain the required resources to satisfy customer demand on a cost effective basis or even to attain the required resources at all  ability to develop  introduce  market and gain market acceptance of new products or services in a timely manner  ability to manage inventories  accounts receivable and cash flows  ability to control costs  and overall market conditions 
the amount of expenses incurred depends  in part  on expectation regarding future revenue 
in addition  since many expenses are fixed in the short term  we cannot significantly reduce expenses if there is a decline in revenue to avoid losses 
our operating results could deteriorate if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels 
our ability to manage our inventories properly is an important factor in our operations 
inventory shortages can adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers and diminish sales 
conversely  excess inventories can result in lower gross margins due to excessive reserves for obsolete products 
our products require incorporation of a wide range of materials which we typically buy in bulk prior to receiving customer orders for the full amount 
we do this to minimize purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery 
however  we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in inventory 
this approach tends to increase the risk of obsolescence for products we hold in inventory and may compound the difficulties posed by other factors that affect our inventory levels which we have experienced  including the following the need to maintain significant inventory of materials that are in limited supply  the unpredictable demand for products  and customer requests for quick delivery schedules 
the accumulation of excess or obsolete inventory may result in increased inventory reserves  which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we may need additional capital 
in order to conduct operations and remain competitive  we must make investments in research and development to fund new product initiatives  continue to upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities  and actively seek out potential acquisition candidates 
although we believe that internal cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and normal operating requirements during the next fiscal year  we may not be able to fund our planned research and development  capital investment programs  and potential acquisitions without seeking additional capital 
our ability to raise additional capital depends on a variety of factors  some of which may not be within our control  including investor perceptions of our management  our business  and the industries in which we operate 
in june  we entered into a million senior secured credit facility with merrill lynch capital  now ge capital  which had no balance outstanding as of september  and was terminated during october we cannot assure you that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to conduct operations 
in such event  we may need to raise additional capital 
the turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or cease operations has resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency and equity markets 
if we raise additional capital through 
table of contents borrowings  we may become subject to restrictive covenants and high interest rates  which would increase the total cost of conducting operations 
however  there can be no assurance that financial resources will be available promptly  on favorable terms or at all 
if we raise money through the issuance of equity securities  your stock ownership will be diluted 
given the instability in the overall financial markets  our stock price has fluctuated and has been subject to volatility 
as a result  a decline in the price of our common stock may adversely impact our ability to fund our operations through the issuance of equity securities 
the issuance of additional equity securities by us following a decline in our stock price may result in a significant dilution of your stock ownership 
any inability to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or cost effective basis could adversely affect our short term liquidity and ability to make investment in research and development to fund new product initiatives  continue to upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities  and actively seek out potential acquisition candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
we depend on contracts with government agencies  which if terminated or reduced  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
a large percentage of our revenue is derived from sales to government agencies 
such government agencies may be subject to budget cuts  budgetary constraints or a reduction or discontinuation of funding 
a significant reduction in funds available for government agencies to purchase professional services and related products would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
although we provide products and services to many customers  a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a few of our larger customers 
for the fiscal year ended september   our top five customers accounted for of our revenue from operations 
it is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand for our products and services that will be generated by these customers or the future demand for the products in the end user marketplace 
our customer concentration exposes us to the risk of changes in the business condition of any of our major customers and to the risk that the loss of a major customer would materially adversely affect our results of operations 
our relationship with these customers is subject to change 
an interruption in the supply of diagnostic and therapeutic products at competitive prices that we purchase from third parties could cause a decline in our revenue 
we purchase certain raw materials  components  services and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products  and the loss of  or disruption to  any plant or supplier could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell many of our products from third parties 
we may experience an interruption of supply if a supplier is unable or unwilling to meet our time  quantity and quality requirements 
there are relatively few alternative suppliers for some of these raw materials and components 
any or all of these suppliers could discontinue manufacturing or supplying these products and components  experience interruptions in their operations or raise their prices 
we may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all 
any transition to alternate suppliers may result in production delays and increased costs and limit our ability to deliver products to our customers 
furthermore  if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply  we would have to modify our products to use substitute components  which may cause delays in shipments  increased design and manufacturing costs  increased prices for our products and lost product revenue 
in addition  we compete with large companies as well as smaller  independent plasma collection centers and brokers of plasma products for plasma source material and processing 
we may be unable to realize our growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or if we cannot integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our business 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to grow our business through acquisitions of technologies or companies 
we may not identify or complete complementary acquisitions in a timely manner  on a cost effective basis  or at all 
in addition  we compete with other companies  including large  well funded 
table of contents competitors  to acquire suitable targets  and may not be able to acquire certain targets that we seek 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute this component of our growth strategy  which may harm our business and hinder our future growth 
to achieve desired growth rates as we become larger  we may seek larger and or public companies as potential acquisition candidates 
the acquisition of a public company may involve additional risks  including the potential for lack of recourse against public shareholders for undisclosed material liabilities of the acquired business 
in addition  if we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consisted of cash  a substantial portion of our available cash resources could be used 
furthermore  for any such acquisition  we will incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses  including expenses associated with a change of control 
if an acquisition was not completed for any reason  we will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the anticipated benefits of the pending acquisition  including anticipated net reductions in costs and expenses and our stock price may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed 
although we expect to realize strategic  operational and financial benefits as a result of these acquisitions  we cannot predict whether and to what extent such benefits will be achieved 
working through integration issues is complex  time consuming and expensive and could significantly disrupt our business 
there are significant challenges to integrating the acquired operations into our business  including successfully managing and assimilating the operations  facilities and technology of the acquired businesses  maintaining and increasing the customer base for the acquired products  demonstrating to customers and suppliers that the acquisitions will not result in adverse changes in service standards or business focus  minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns  maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees  integrating cultures and management structures and accurately forecasting employee benefit costs  consolidating our management information  inventory  accounting and other systems  our ability to assess accurately the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business  our ability to integrate acquired businesses and to achieve identified financial and operating synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition  increased pressure on our staff and on our operating systems  and unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business 
our failure to successfully integrate and operate the acquired businesses  and to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions  could adversely impact our operating performance and financial results 
our success depends in large part upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees  including certain sales  consulting and technical personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate the qualified personnel that will be essential to our current plans and future development 
the competition for such personnel is substantial and we cannot assure you that we will successfully retain our key employees or attract and retain any required additional personnel 
the loss of the services of any significant employee could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the past  employees have resigned from the company and joined competitors or formed competing companies 
the loss of such personnel and the resulting loss of existing or potential clients to any such competitor has had  and could continue to have  a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may face additional expenses and cash funding needs pending the sale of our manufacturing facility in west bridgewater  massachusetts 
although we have entered into an agreement to sell the west bridgewater facility  the sale is subject to customary closing conditions and we can not assure that the sale will close 
should the sale not close  it may take months and possibly a year or longer to sell the west bridgewater facility at a suitable price 
the real estate market is affected by many factors  such as general economic conditions  availability of financing  interest rates and other factors  including supply and demand that are beyond our control 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell the property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us 
we cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of the property 
in february  the mortgage note on the building matures and the remaining principal of million will become due 
if we are unable to sell the property before february or refinance the mortgage note  it could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations 
lack of early success with our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers can shut us out of future business with those customers 
many of the products we sell to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers are incorporated into the customers drug manufacturing processes 
in some cases  once a customer chooses a particular product for use in a diagnostic and therapeutic testing process or drug manufacturing process  it is less likely that the customer will later switch to a competing alternative 
in many cases  the regulatory license for the product will specify the separation and cell culture supplement products qualified for use in the process 
obtaining the regulatory approvals needed for a change in the manufacturing process is time consuming  expensive and uncertain 
accordingly  if we fail to convince a diagnostic or therapeutic customer to choose our products early in its manufacturing design phase  we may permanently lose the opportunity to participate in the customer s production of such product 
because we face vigorous competition in this market from companies with substantial financial and technical resources  we run the risk that our competitors will win significant early business with a customer making it difficult for us to recover that opportunity 
our profits will likely decline if we are unable to pass price increases on to customers or obtain necessary raw materials at their current prices 
some of our customer contracts are firm  fixed price contracts  providing for a predetermined fixed price for the products that we make  regardless of the costs we incur 
if we experience significant increases in the expense of producing products due to increased cost of materials  components  labor  capital equipment or other factors and are unable to pass through such increases to our customers  our profitability will likely decline 
the cost of producing the company s products and services is also sensitive to the price of energy 
the selling prices of the company s products and services have not always increased in response to raw material  energy or other cost increases and the company is unable to determine to what extent  if any  it will be able to pass future cost increases through to its customers 
the company s inability to pass increased costs through to its customers could materially and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 
our failure to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new products may negatively impact our business 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate new technological advances 
if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design  develop  manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner  our operating results will be adversely affected 
while we expect to continue to invest in research and development for all of our market segments  we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance 

table of contents we are subject to the risks associated with international sales 
international sales accounted for of our revenue from operations during the year ended september  we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue 
risks associated with these sales include political and economic instability  export controls  changes in legal and regulatory requirements  united states and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products  and changes in tax laws and tariffs 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we sell our products in certain international markets mainly through independent distributors 
if a distributor fails to meet annual sales goals  it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor 
if a change in our distributors becomes necessary  we may experience increased costs  as well as a substantial disruption in operations and a resulting loss of revenue 
if we fail to maintain adequate quality standards for our products and services  our business may be adversely affected and our reputation harmed 
our customers are subject to rigorous quality standards in order to maintain their products and the manufacturing processes and testing methods that generate them 
a failure to sustain the specified quality requirements  including the processing and testing functions performed by our products  could result in the loss of the applicable regulatory license 
delays or quality lapses in our customers production lines could result in substantial economic losses to them and to us 
for example  large production lots of plasma are expensive and a failure to properly categorize the disease state of plasma could result in the contamination of the entire lot  requiring its destruction 
we also perform services that may be considered an extension of our customers manufacturing and quality assurance processes  which also require the maintenance of prescribed levels of quality 
although we believe that our continued focus on quality throughout the company adequately addresses these risks  there can be no assurance that we will not experience occasional or systemic quality lapses in our manufacturing and service operations 
if we experience significant or prolonged quality problems  our business and reputation may be harmed  which may result in the loss of customers  our inability to participate in future customer product opportunities and reduced revenue and earnings 
our principal shareholders may exert significant influence on us 
as of september   the combined group of jacob safier and ltova holdings llc collectively ltova  ashford capital management inc ashford capital and black horse capital were beneficial owners of approximately  and  respectively  of the company s common stock 
therefore  ltova  ashford capital and black horse capital have power to exert significant influence on our management and policies and on the outcome of issues requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of our board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
we heavily rely on air cargo carriers and other third party package delivery services  and a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to import or export materials  increase our costs and lower our profitability 
we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies 
in addition  we transport materials among our facilities and import raw materials from worldwide sources 
consequently  we heavily rely on air cargo carriers and third party package delivery providers 
if any of our key third party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption such that any of our 
table of contents products  components or raw materials cannot be delivered in a timely fashion or such that we incur additional shipping costs that we could not pass on to our customers  our costs may increase and our relationships with certain of our customers may be adversely affected 
in particular  our products are particularly sensitive to temperature and delays in shipping could damage the products 
in addition  if our third party package delivery providers increase prices and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments to our delivery network  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities  and if our manufacturing capabilities are insufficient to produce an adequate supply of products at appropriate quality levels  our growth could be limited and our business could be harmed 
we currently have limited resources and facilities for the commercial manufacturing of sufficient quantities of product to meet expected demand 
we have focused significant effort on continual improvement programs in our manufacturing operations intended to improve quality  yields and throughput 
although we believe we currently have sufficient capacity in manufacturing to enable us to supply adequate amounts of product to support our commercialization efforts  there can be no assurances that supply will not be constrained going forward 
if we are unable to manufacture a sufficient supply of our products  maintain control over expenses or otherwise adapt to anticipated growth  or if we underestimate growth  we may not have the capability to satisfy market demand and our business will suffer 
the cost of compliance or failure to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of may adversely affect our business 
as a public reporting company  we are subject to the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  which may result in higher compliance costs and may adversely affect our financial results and our ability to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 
the sarbanes oxley act affects corporate governance  securities disclosure  compliance practices  internal audits  disclosure controls and procedures  and financial reporting and accounting systems 
section of the sarbanes oxley act  for example  requires a company subject to the reporting requirements of the us securities laws to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries internal controls over financial reporting 
the failure to comply with section may result in investors losing confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock  prevent us from providing the required financial information in a timely manner which could materially and adversely impact our business  our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock  prevent us from otherwise complying with the standards applicable to us as a public company and subject us to adverse regulatory consequences 
our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could prevent us from selling our products and hinder our financial performance 
the technology and designs underlying our products may not be fully protected by patent rights 
our future success is dependent primarily on non patented trade secrets and on the innovative skills  technological expertise and management abilities of our employees 
our technology may not preclude or inhibit competitors from producing products that have identical performance as our products 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that any protected trade secret could ultimately be proven valid if challenged 
any such challenge  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert the attention and resources of our management and  if successful  require us to pay monetary damages 
product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a manufacturer and marketer of various diagnostic and therapeutic products  our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the performance  quality or safety of our products 
even though we believe that our current product liability insurance is sufficient at this time  product liability claims challenging performance  quality or safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular 
table of contents product  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
this could be true even if the claims themselves are proven not to be true or settled for immaterial amounts 
foreign restrictions on importation and exportation of blood derivatives 
concern over blood safety has led to movements in a number of european and other countries to restrict the importation and exportation of blood and blood derivatives  including antibodies collected outside the countries borders or  in the case of certain european countries  outside europe 
to date  these efforts have not led to any meaningful restriction on the importation or exportation of blood or blood derivates and have not adversely affected our business 
such restrictions  however  continue to be debated  and there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not be imposed in the future 
if imposed  such restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products 
a disaster at our facilities could substantially impact our business 
our business and operations depend on the extent to which our facilities and products are protected against damage from fire  earthquakes  power loss and similar events 
despite precautions we have taken  a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem could  among other things  hinder our research and development efforts  delay the shipment of our products and affect our ability to receive and fulfill orders 
for example  our two facilities in maryland store approximately million biological samples for our government and commercial customers  and such samples are irreplaceable 
additionally  our milford facility is our primary manufacturing plant 
although we believe that our back up power sources are sufficient in an emergency situation  an earthquake  fire  other disaster or continuous power outage at any of these locations would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we believe that our insurance coverage is comparable to those of similar companies in our industry  it does not cover terrorism or all natural disasters  in particular  floods 
our financial condition could suffer if we experience unanticipated costs or enforcement action as a result of the department of justice investigation and other lawsuits 
the company is still subject to an investigation by the department of justice that was initiated in the first half of while the company was under prior management 
the period of time necessary to resolve such investigation is uncertain and these matters could require significant management time and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business 
if we are subject to an adverse finding resulting from the investigation  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us 
in addition  considerable legal and accounting expenses related to this matter have been incurred to date and significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in the future 
risks related to our industry reduced demand due to economic downturn in overall market 
our business is exposed to the risk that adverse economic conditions will reduce or defer the demand for research and development that utilize our products 
the demand for our products may fluctuate based upon a variety of factors  including the business and financial condition of our customers and on economic and financial conditions  particularly as they affect the key sectors in which our customers operate 
economic downturns or unfavorable changes in the financial and credit markets could have an adverse effect on the operations  budgets and overall financial condition of our customers 
as a result  our customers may reduce their overall spending on research and development  purchase fewer of our products by reducing the amount they use or using their existing inventory  lengthen sales cycles  or delay  defer or cancel purchases of our products 
furthermore  our customers may be less able to timely finance or pay for the products which they have purchased 
we cannot predict the impact  timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery  generally or in any specific industry  or of any disruptions in the financial and credit markets 
if the challenges in the financial and credit markets or the downturn in the economy or the 
table of contents markets in which we operate persist or worsen from present levels  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively with larger companies with greater financial resources than we have 
the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and often lack significant barriers to entry  enabling new businesses to enter these markets relatively easily 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do  making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development  manufacturing and marketing efforts 
moreover  competitive conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to implement price increases to fully recover any higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics 
although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors  maintaining these advantages will require us to continue to invest in research and development  sales and marketing and customer service and support 
competition for customers depends primarily on the ability to provide products or services of the quality and in the quantity required by customers 
if we succeed in bringing one or more products to market  we will compete with many other companies that may have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
our failure to provide products of the quality and quantity demanded by our customers and successfully market new products could have a material adverse effect on our future business  financial condition and results of operation 
certain of our disease state products are derived from donors with rare characteristics  resulting in increased competition for such donors 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our donor base  this could have a material adverse effect on our future business  financial condition and results of operation 
we are subject to significant regulation by the government and other regulatory authorities 
our business is heavily regulated in the united states and internationally 
in addition to the fda which regulates  among other matters  the testing  manufacturing  storage  labeling  export  and marketing of blood products and ivd products  various other federal  state and local regulations also apply and can be  in some cases  more restrictive 
if we fail to comply with fda or other regulatory requirements  we could be subjected to civil and criminal penalties  or even required to suspend or cease operations 
any such actions could severely curtail our sales to biologics companies 
failure of our plasma suppliers or customers to comply with fda requirements could also adversely affect us 
in addition  more restrictive laws  regulations or interpretations could be adopted  which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business 
we also invest significant resources in developing quality assurance programs  such as iso certification 
we devote substantial resources to complying with laws and regulations  however  the possibility cannot be eliminated that interpretations of existing laws and regulations will result in findings that we have not complied with significant existing regulations 
such a finding could materially harm the business 
moreover  healthcare reform is continually under consideration by regulators  and the company does not know how laws and regulations will change in the future 
failure to comply with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including the federal occupational safety and health administration act  may result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure  and have a material adverse effect upon the company s business 
the company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety  including laws and regulations relating to the handling  transportation and disposal of medical specimens  infectious and hazardous waste as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees 
all of the company s laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory 
table of contents specimens  and we utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens 
in addition  the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers  including clinical laboratories  whose workers may be exposed to blood borne pathogens  such as hiv and hbv 
these requirements  among other things  require work practice controls  protective clothing and equipment  training  medical follow up  vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to  and transmission of  blood borne pathogens 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal agencies  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to comply with all applicable standards or that violations will not occur 
failure to comply with federal  state and local laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business  fines  criminal penalties and or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business 
in addition  compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that more restrictive laws  rules and regulations or enforcement policies will not be adopted in the future which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business or prospects 
changes in demand for plasma derived products and the availability of donated plasma could affect profitability 
a majority of our business depends on the availability of donated plasma 
only a small percentage of the population donates plasma and regulations intended to reduce the risk of introducing infectious diseases in the blood supply have decreased the pool of potential donors 
if the level of donor participation declines  the company may not be able to obtain adequate supply at a reasonable cost to maintain profitability in plasma derived products 
we are subject to governmental reforms and the adequacy of reimbursement 
our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs 
these changes include increased use of managed care  cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels  consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical surgical supply distributors  and the development of large  sophisticated purchasing groups 
we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future 
some of these changes  such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services  legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information  or the delivery or pricing of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits  may cause healthcare industry participants to greatly reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services 
the obama administration has identified healthcare as a policy priority and has released an outline of its healthcare policy initiatives as they relate to the federal budget 
the outline identifies guiding principles for healthcare reform and spending  which include increasing access to and affordability of healthcare  primarily by ensuring access to health insurance  increasing effectiveness of care  through effective use of technology and an emphasis on evidence based medicine  maintaining patient choice  emphasizing preventive care and enhancing the fiscal sustainability of the us healthcare system 
specific initiatives described in the outline include reducing drug costs for federal programs by increasing availability of generics and increasing the medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers to states  increasing incentives to reduce unnecessary variability in treatment and to practice evidence based medicine  incentivizing the use of electronic medical records and other technology  and reducing unnecessary or wasteful spending 
currently  the matter of healthcare reform continues to be debated by lawmakers and we are unable to provide guidance on what the final legislation will be and how it will impact us 
additional regulation and continued fiscal pressure may adversely affect our business

diagnostic biopharmaceutical products revenue had million in sales from therapeutic grade human serum albumin products during the year ended september  as compared to million during the year ended september  this revenue has historically been variable and was not significant during fiscal due to the validation requirements to switch suppliers of raw materials used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing 
the company switched suppliers in december as its previous supply agreement was not renewed 
excluding therapeutic grade human serum albumin products  revenue from our core manufactured products increased million  or 
during the year ended september   revenue for our bioservices segment decreased by million or to million from million in the year ended september  we billed million during the year ended september  pursuant to a government contract which related to the 
table of contents settlement of indirect billing rates used in previous periods 
we had no such billings during the year ended september  the remaining decrease is due to fewer requests for services from our customers as a result of reduced research spending stemming from the economic downturn during fiscal gross profit gross profit margin increased to in the year ended september  from in the year ended september  the increase in margin was mainly attributable to the increase in our diagnostic and biopharmaceutical products margin to in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september  the product margin increased due to efficiencies related to consolidating our manufacturing operations and improved cost cutting measures and the increased focus on inventory control taken during the year ended september  this increase in products margin was offset by the bioservices margin decreasing to in the year ended september  from in the year ended september  during the year ended september   our bioservices margin rates benefited from million billed pursuant to a government contract which related to the settlement of indirect billing rates used in previous periods 
research and development expense research and development expense totaled million  or of revenue  in the year ended september  and million  or of revenue  in the year ended september  during the year ended september   we have focused on cost control resulting in reduced compensation and other project related expenses 
as a result  spending has decreased as compared to the year ended september  selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of revenue  in the year ended september   from million  or of revenue  in the year ended september  as part of our fiscal operating plan  we have streamlined the organization to achieve operational efficiencies and reduce compensation expense

in addition  stock compensation expense has decreased million during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  impairment of assets due to the turmoil in the financial markets and the associated decline in the company s stock price and market capitalization  the company recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million during the year ended september  related to its diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment 
during the first half of the year ended september   the financial markets and the company s stock price continued to decline and the company revised its future cash flow projections as revenue was lower than expected due to the economic downturn 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge to goodwill in the amount of million which related to its diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment 
this represents the entire balance of goodwill related to the diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment 
the company determined the fair value of this segment under various methodologies including performing a discounted cash flow analysis as well as allocating the company s market capitalization to each segment according to revenue 
using a discounted cash flow model requires a number of assumptions about future cash flows and related costs necessary to generate such estimated cash flows 
using what management believes were reasonable assumptions based on the best information available as of the testing date  the value of the bioservices segment was found to be in excess of its carrying value  and therefore the related goodwill was not impaired 
the remaining goodwill of million relates to the bioservices segment 
there was no impairment charge associated with the bioservices segment as it is service driven and has fewer assigned assets which have a lower carrying amount as compared to the diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment which requires more assets to manufacture and sell products 

table of contents the company will continue to test goodwill for impairment as part of its annual impairment testing or as events occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value

debt on june   the company entered into a three year credit and security agreement  dated as of june   with merrill lynch capital  now ge capital  pursuant to which a million revolving loan facility was made available to the company 
the company terminated the line of credit in october obligations under the credit and security agreement were secured by substantially all the assets of the company excluding the company s real property located at its west bridgewater facility  which is subject to a separate mortgage note

the company paid per annum as an unused line fee 
interest was payable monthly 
amounts under the revolving credit facility may have been repaid and re borrowed until june  mandatory prepayments of the revolving credit facility were required any time the outstanding revolving loan balance exceeded the borrowing base 
the agreement contained standard representations  covenants and events of default for facilities of this type 
in addition  the agreement prohibited the payment of dividends during the term of the agreement 
occurrence of an event of default would have allowed the lenders to accelerate the payment of the loan and or terminate the commitments to lend  in addition to the exercise of other legal remedies  including foreclosing on collateral

critical accounting policies and estimates we have determined that for the periods covered in our annual report the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding the financial condition and results of our operations 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when we meet all of the criteria specified in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
these criteria include evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  prices are fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
signed customer purchase orders or sales agreements evidence our sales arrangements 
these purchase orders and sales agreements specify both selling prices and quantities  which are the basis for recording sales revenue 
trade terms for the majority of our sales contracts indicate that title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers when we ship products from our facilities  which is when revenue is recognized 
revenue is deferred until the appropriate time in situations where trade terms indicate that title and risk of loss pass from us to the customers at a later stage in the shipment process 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
revenue from service arrangements is recognized when the services are provided as long as all other criteria of sab are met 
the company will accept the return of goods  if prior to returning the goods  the purchaser contacts the company and requests a return authorization and we approve this authorization based upon the customer clearly stating the reason for the return 
the company maintains an allowance for sales returns and records a decrease to revenue when it has specific knowledge of a customer complaint 
the allowance for sales returns was nominal as of september  and was million as of september  inventory valuation 
inventory consists primarily of human blood plasma and products derived from human blood plasma 
inventory is carried at specifically identified cost and assessed periodically to ensure it is valued at the lower of cost or market 
our ability to manage our inventories properly is an important factor in our operations 
inventory shortages can adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers and diminish sales 
conversely  excess inventories can result in lower gross margins due to excessive reserves for obsolete products 
our products require incorporation of a wide range of materials which we typically buy in bulk prior to receiving customer orders for the full amount 
we do this to minimize purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery 
however  we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in inventory 
this approach tends to increase the risk of obsolescence for products we hold in inventory 
a provision has been made to reduce excess and not readily marketable inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
we provide a reserve based upon factors related to age  historical scrap rates  usability and 
table of contents fair market value 
the company s recorded inventory reserve was million and million as of september  and  respectively 
should it be determined that the reserve is insufficient  we would be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative impact on gross profit margin 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
valuation of certain long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill requires significant judgment 
assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets and goodwill 
assigning value to intangible assets requires that we use significant judgment in determining i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and  if the former  the period and the method by which the intangible assets will be amortized 
changes in the initial assumptions could lead to changes in amortization expense recorded in our future financial statements 
for intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance related to historical or expected projected future operating results  or significant changes or developments in strategy or operations which affect our long lived assets 
should we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets may not be recoverable  we will measure any impairment based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method 
significant judgments and assumptions are required to estimate future cash flows 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 
we perform reviews for the impairment of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill may be considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the reporting unit s fair value 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units 
contingencies and litigation reserves 
the company is involved from time to time in litigation incidental to the conduct of the company s business 
these claims may be brought by  among others  the government  clients  customers  employees and other third parties 
management considers the measurement of litigation reserves as a critical accounting estimate because of the significant uncertainty in some cases relating to the outcome of potential claims or litigation and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from litigation or other claims 
in determining contingency and litigation reserves  management considers  among other issues interpretation of contractual rights and obligations  the status of government regulatory initiatives  interpretations and investigations  the status of settlement negotiations  prior experience with similar types of claims  whether there is available insurance  and advice of counsel 
stock based compensation 
the company recognizes share based payments to employees and directors as compensation expense in the results of operations using a fair value based method 
compensation expense of million  million and million was recognized in the years ended september   and  respectively  for all awards granted on or after october  as well as for the unvested portion of awards granted before october  
table of contents stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of our restricted stock awards and stock units based on the quoted market price of our common stock 
we recognize the associated compensation expense on a graded vesting method over the vesting periods of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical pre vesting forfeiture history and are updated to reflect actual forfeitures of unvested awards and other known events 
management believes this graded vesting methodology is a truer reflection of the expenses incurred for the options granted than the alternative straight line method 
estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected term  expected dividends and risk free interest rates 
the expected volatility rates are based on the historical fluctuation in the stock price since inception 
the average expected term was calculated under the guidance of sab no 
and  simplified method for estimating the expected term as we have limited exercise data since we reorganized in may expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections 
the risk free interest rate for periods approximating the expected terms of the options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
these assumptions will be updated at least on an annual basis or when there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  management is required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent management establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  an increase to expense within the provision for income taxes in the statement of operations will result 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded in connection with the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million and million as of september  and september   respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on management s current estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which seracare operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  an additional valuation allowance may need to be established which would increase the tax provision  lowering income and impacting seracare s financial position 
should realization of these deferred assets previously reserved occur  the provision for income tax would decrease  raising income and positively impacting seracare s financial position 
in addition  any interest and penalties assessed by the taxing authorities are recorded as selling  general and administrative expense 
recent accounting pronouncements the company adopted the financial accounting standards board the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the source of authoritative gaap for nongovernmental entities 
the codification does not change gaap but rather takes the numerous individual pronouncements that previously constituted gaap and reorganizes them into approximately accounting topics  and displays all topics using a consistent structure 
the adoption of the codification did not have an effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
during may  the fasb issued guidance concerning subsequent events which applies prospectively and is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june  this guidance establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued and requires the disclosure of the date through 
table of contents which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
the company s adoption of the guidance did not have an effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fasb provided guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities which applies whenever other guidance requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
the guidance clarifies that for items that are not actively traded  such as certain kinds of derivatives  fair value should reflect the price in a transaction with a market participant  including an adjustment for risk  not just the company s mark to market value 
the guidance also requires expanded disclosure of the effect on earnings for items measured using unobservable data 
fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  such as the reporting entity s own data 
under the guidance  fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the fasb agreed to defer the effective date of the guidance for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the company adopted this guidance on october  for assets and liabilities not subject to the deferral and will adopt this statement on october  for all other assets and liabilities 
the guidance did not have and is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
on december   the fasb revised its guidance for business combinations 
under the revised guidance  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
the guidance will change the accounting treatment for certain items as follows acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
the revised guidance also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
the revised guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
accordingly  the company will adopt this guidance on october  the guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
on december   the fasb issued guidance which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this guidance requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the 
table of contents income statement 
the guidance clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this guidance requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
the guidance also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
accordingly  the company will adopt this guidance on october  the guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at september  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest payments operating lease obligations purchase obligations total long term debt obligations include capital leases 
million relates to the commerce bank trust mortgage note which is due on february  while the remaining million relates to capital leases 
interest payment amounts include unused line fees owed to ge capital under the credit and security agreement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk 
as of september   our only assets or liabilities subject to risks from interest rate changes are i debt under the west bridgewater mortgage note in the aggregate amount of million and ii cash and cash equivalents of million  substantially all of which were held in overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by federal government agency or government sponsored enterprise securities 
our mortgage note bears interest at a variable rate 
a one percentage point change in interest rates affecting the company s floating rate long term debt would change pre tax income by approximately  over the next twelve months 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company does not believe that it currently has material exposure to foreign currency exchange risk because all international sales are designated in us dollars 
we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at september
