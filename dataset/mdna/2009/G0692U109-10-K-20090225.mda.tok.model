table of contents gross premiums written by broker  shown individually where premiums are or more of the total in any of the last three years  were as follows year ended december  aon marsh willis other brokers direct total to facilitate period to period comparisons  we have made certain reclassification to prior year balances to conform to our current presentation  which reflects broker consolidations during competitive environment in our reinsurance segment where competition tends to be focused on availability  service  financial strength and increasingly price  we compete with major us and us reinsurers as well as reinsurance departments of numerous multi line insurance organizations 
we believe we achieve a competitive advantage through our strong capital position as well as our technical expertise that allows us to respond quickly to customer needs and provide quality and innovative underwriting solutions 
in addition  our customers highly value our exemplary service  strong capitalization and financial strength ratings 
reinsurance protection our ceded reinsurance unit purchases treaty and facultative reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses or a series of large losses 
all treaty reinsurance purchases and our facultative reinsurance strategies are pre approved by our reinsurance purchasing group  which consists of senior management 
facultative reinsurance provides for all or a portion of the insurance provided by a single policy and each policy reinsured is individually negotiated 
treaty reinsurance provides for a specified type or category of risks 
our reinsurance agreements may be on an excess of loss or quota share basis 
excess of loss covers provide a contractually set amount of cover after an excess point has been reached 
this excess point can be based on the size of an industry loss or a fixed monetary amount 
these covers can be purchased on a package policy basis  which provide cover for a number of lines of business within one contract 
quota share covers provide a proportional amount of coverage from the first dollar of loss 
all of these reinsurance covers provide for recovery of a portion of losses and loss expenses from reinsurers 
we remain liable to the extent that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under these agreements 
reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses we establish reserves for losses and loss expenses that arise from our insurance and reinsurance products 
these reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss expenses for insured or reinsured claims that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date  whether already known or not yet reported 
our loss reserves are established based upon our estimate of the total cost of claims that were reported to us but not yet paid case reserves  and the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 
the table below shows the development of our loss reserves since inception 
to illustrate an understanding of the information in this table  following is an example using reserves established at december  
table of contents the top lines of the table show for successive balance sheet dates the gross and net unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at or prior to each balance sheet date 
it can be seen that at december   a reserve of  million  net of reinsurance had been established 
the lower part of the table presents the net amounts paid as of periods subsequent to the balance sheet date 
hence in the year ended december  net payments of million were made from the december   reserve balance 
by the end of  cumulative net payments against the december  net reserves were  million 
the upper part of the table shows the revised estimate of the net liabilities originally recorded as of the end of subsequent years 
with the benefit of actual loss emergence over the intervening period  the net liabilities incurred as of december   are now estimated to be  million  rather than the original estimate of  million 
of the cumulative redundancy of million recognized in the three years since december   million was identified and recorded in  million in and million in importantly  the cumulative deficiency or redundancy for different balance sheet dates is not independent and therefore  should not be added together 
in  we have revised our estimate of the december   liabilities from  million to  million 
this favorable development of million will also be included in each column to the right of december   to recognize that there was also reserve redundancy in the reserves established at december  and december  year ended december gross reserve for losses and loss expenses reinsurance recoverable net losses and loss expenses reserve net reserves reestimated as of year later years later years later years later years later years later years later cumulative redundancy cumulative net paid losses year later years later years later years later years later years later years later impact of unrealized foreign exchange movements the table above also shows the impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
movements in foreign exchange rates between periods result in variations in our net loss reserves  as the us dollar  our reporting currency  strengthens or weakens against underlying currencies 
for example  for the year ended december   the strengthening of the us dollar  primarily against euro and sterling  resulted in a million reduction in our net loss reserves  established prior to  or during  we generally hold investments in the same currency as our net reserves  with the intent of matching the impact of foreign exchange movements on our assets and liabilities 

table of contents conditions and trends that affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may be inappropriate to anticipate future redundancies or deficiencies based on historical experience 
the key issues and considerations involved in establishing our estimate of our loss reserves is discussed in more detail within the critical accounting estimates reserve for losses and loss expenses section of item for additional information regarding the key underlying movements in our loss reserves in the last three years  refer to the group underwriting results loss ratio section of item cash and investments we follow an investment strategy designed to optimize book value growth and generate appropriate risk adjusted returns while providing sufficient liquidity to meet our claims and other obligations 
as such  our funds are primarily invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment grade fixed maturity investments as measured by the major rating agencies

our cash and cash equivalents are invested directly by our investment managers or invested in high quality money market funds under the direction of our treasury department 
our investment team determines target asset allocations which are derived from asset and liability modeling that measures correlated histories of returns and volatility of returns 
permitted investment classes are further refined for each subsidiary through analysis of our operating environment  including expected volatility of cash flows  overall capital position  regulatory  and rating agency considerations
