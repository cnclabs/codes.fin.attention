item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals  polymers and fabricated products 
our two principal business segments are olefins and vinyls 
we use the majority of our internally produced basic chemicals to produce higher value added chemicals and fabricated products 
consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly over the past years 
our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value added chemical products used in many end markets 
petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies 
the petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics  and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates  the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials 
the cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply  leading to high operating rates and margins  followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of significant capacity additions 
due to the significant size of new plants  capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed 
in and  the olefins and vinyls markets began a cyclical recovery and operating rates and margins rose as economic growth improved and excess capacity was absorbed 
these factors resulted in increased industry product margins in  and in and  however  weakness in the housing market contributed to lower demand  and operating margins have declined in our vinyls business 
the demand for olefins products remained strong in largely due to balanced industry supply and demand fundamentals for polyethylene and strong export demand  but margins were lower due to increased feedstock costs 
in  olefins margins declined significantly due to a sharp drop in product demand that started in august as customers began to anticipate lower product prices due to a weakened global economy 
this was followed by a sharp drop in product prices in the last quarter of  which resulted in continued slow demand  lower operating rates and a significant operating loss in the fourth quarter of pvc industry operating rates dropped from peak levels in the third quarter of to much lower levels in the fourth quarter of this downturn  which impacts our vinyls segment  was primarily due to weakness in the construction market which started in september and continued through looking forward  north american pvc capacity is projected to increase in and capacity growth is expected to exceed demand growth and  as a result  operating rates and margins may not improve and could decline further from levels 
olefins industry forecasts show a significant increase in worldwide ethylene capacity over the next five years  with the largest increase in the middle east and asia 
as a result  operating margins may not improve and could decline further in and we purchase significant amounts of ethane and propane feedstock  natural gas  chlorine and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains 
we also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes 
while we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane and propane feedstocks  natural gas  chlorine  salt and electricity  the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile 
factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future  include shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand  capacity constraints due to construction delays  strike action or involuntary shutdowns  the general level of business and economic activity  and the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation 

table of contents significant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases 
conversely  when raw material costs decrease  customers may seek relief in the form of lower sales prices 
we currently use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstock commodities and lower overall costs 
normally  there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived 
when this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms  we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship 
our historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity  our efficient use of the capacity and our ability to increase our capacity 
since our inception  we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions  new plant construction and internal expansion 
we evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs 
in august  we announced that we will construct a new chlor alkali plant to be located at our vinyls manufacturing complex in geismar  louisiana 
the new chlor alkali unit is expected to produce  ecus annually upon completion  bringing our total ecu capacity to  per year  including the chlor alkali expansion at our calvert city complex described below 
the new plant is expected to improve the vertical integration of our vinyls business from chlorine downstream into vcm and pvc  and increase caustic soda sales 
the project is currently estimated to cost between million and million and is targeted for completion in we expect the project will be partially funded with funds drawn from the proceeds of the issuance of the revenue bonds of the louisiana local government environmental facility and development authority  issued in december for our benefit  which are currently held as restricted cash 
the remaining funding will depend on our revolving credit facility  cash flow from operations  and  possibly  our ability to obtain additional financing 
we announced in march our plans to open a new pvc pipe plant in yucca  arizona to produce pipe for water  sewer  irrigation and related industrial and residential markets in the western united states 
the new plant became operational in the first quarter of and has the capacity to produce approximately million pounds of pvc pipe annually 
we decided to permanently close our pawling  new york facility and consolidate manufacturing of window and door components in calgary  canada in the first quarter of in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we announced the idling of our van buren  arkansas pvc pipe facility 
asset impairments  severance and other costs recorded in related to the pawling plant closure and the idling of the van buren plant were approximately million 
in october  we announced our plans to expand our chlor alkali and pvc resin units and build a large diameter pvc pipe plant at our calvert city complex 
the chlor alkali expansion was completed in the fourth quarter of and has added  ecus of annual capacity 
the chlor alkali expansion is expected to improve the vertical integration of our vinyls business from chlorine downstream into vcm and pvc and increase caustic soda sales 
the pvc resin plant expansion was completed in the first quarter of and increased capacity by million pounds per year  bringing our total pvc capacity to billion pounds annually 
the expansion is expected to enhance the integration of the vinyls product chain by consuming vcm that was previously sold on the merchant market 
during the third quarter of  we also completed construction of a new large diameter pvc pipe facility at the complex with a capacity of approximately million pounds per year of large diameter pipe 
our annual fabricated products capacity increased to approximately  million pounds with this expansion and the completion of the yucca plant 
since we have been in discussions with the government of the republic of trinidad and tobago the government to develop an ethane based ethylene  polyethylene and other derivatives project in that country 
the project has faced several major constraints  and we and the government are discussing how to overcome those challenges 
in the interim  we have suspended active work on the project 

table of contents we experienced several shut downs and turnarounds from to in  we completed a scheduled major maintenance turnaround in calvert city 
the ethylene and vcm units at calvert city were down for days while the chlor alkali and pvc units were down for a shorter period 
sales continued during the turnaround from inventory on hand 
in september  we encountered mechanical problems with a compressor and related equipment at one of our ethylene units in lake charles  louisiana  resulting in an unscheduled shutdown of that unit 
while that unit was down  we completed a maintenance turnaround of that unit that was scheduled for early during the unit s shut down  we also completed portions of our project to upgrade the feedstock flexibility at our ethylene plant designed to reduce energy costs and provide for additional ethylene capacity 
the unit was successfully restarted in late october and resumed full production 
as a result of the lake charles outage  we incurred approximately million in maintenance expense and million in turnaround costs which were capitalized 
in  we completed a major turnaround for one of our ethylene units at our lake charles facility 
the unit was shut down for approximately days to complete the tie in portion of a project designed to upgrade the feedstock flexibility of the unit in order to reduce energy costs and provide for additional ethylene capacity 
the cost of the turnaround of approximately million was capitalized 
in addition  during the first and second quarters of we performed a major turnaround of our styrene plant in lake charles 
the unit was shut down for a total of days to perform a major maintenance turnaround and revamp project designed to increase energy efficiency and slightly increase capacity 
the cost of this turnaround was approximately million  which was capitalized 
also  during august and september  we shut down our vinyls facilities at our geismar  louisiana complex and our olefins facilities at our lake charles  louisiana complex due to hurricanes gustav and ike 
both complexes sustained minimal damage from the hurricanes  however  the energy and power shortages caused by the hurricanes affected many suppliers and  as a consequence  the lake charles facilities were shut down for approximately three weeks due to the two hurricanes  while the geismar facilities were shut down for approximately one and a half weeks due to hurricane gustav 
in addition  one of our ethylene units in lake charles was idled during december due to significant customer inventory destocking and resulting weakened demand for our derivative products 
a maintenance turnaround initially scheduled for this unit for the first half of has been brought forward to be performed during this down time  and the facility is expected to resume operations in the first quarter of

summary for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million  or per diluted share  on net sales of  million 
this represents a decrease of million  or per diluted share  from the year ended december  net income of million  or per diluted share  which included a tax benefit of million  or per diluted share  related to a reduction in deferred taxes due to a change in apportionment ratios upon the reorganization of several subsidiaries 
sales for the year ended december  increased from sales of  million to  million  primarily due to higher average sales prices for all of the major products 
a significant increase in product prices in the first three quarters of was reversed in the fourth quarter of as prices fell in response to lower demand and the sharp drop in feedstock costs 
the net loss is largely the result of a million net loss in the fourth quarter of  primarily due to the sharp drop in product prices  resulting in a significant negative operating margin 
the loss from operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to income from operations of million for the year ended december  the results have been negatively impacted by a number of factors  including the sharp drop in operating income in the fourth quarter of as discussed in the following paragraph  the effects of hurricanes gustav and ike  higher raw material  natural gas and electricity costs  lower pvc pipe sales volume and a loss from trading activities 
our olefins segment benefited from high operating rates through much of largely due to balanced industry supply and demand fundamentals for polyethylene  however  this segment experienced a sharp drop in product demand that began in the third quarter of as customers began to anticipate lower product prices due to a weakened global economy 
this was followed by a sharp drop in product prices in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in continued slow demand  lower operating rates and significantly lower operating margins 
in addition  olefins margins were negatively impacted by rising feedstock  natural gas and electricity costs and a trading loss of million in compared to a trading loss of million in our vinyls segment results in were relatively flat compared to as lower margins and volumes for downstream products  primarily due to the poor construction market  were mostly offset by higher caustic margins 
the fourth quarter operating loss was million as compared to operating income in the fourth quarter of of million  a decrease of million 
the significant loss in the fourth quarter of was primarily due to a sharp drop in product prices  a significant drop in sales volumes and operating rates and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the sharp drop in product prices in the fourth quarter of was primarily due to a collapse in feedstock prices 
for ethane and propane  our two primary raw materials  average industry prices dropped and  respectively  from september  to december  as a result  polyethylene and pvc resin industry prices dropped and  respectively  during the same period 
it generally takes to days from the time our feedstock is purchased  converted into finished goods  inventoried and sold 
as a result of utilizing the first in  first out fifo method of inventory accounting  and the rapid drop in feedstock costs and product prices in the fourth quarter  we had very high feedstock costs recorded in cost of sales in the fourth quarter of  while our product sales prices were based on lower market sales prices due to the weakened demand for the products 
this resulted in significant inventory losses  inclusive 
table of contents of transportation and other distribution costs  and million of adjustments due to the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market prices  in the fourth quarter of in addition  our plants operated at reduced rates in the fourth quarter of due to the general weakened demand as a result of the continued deterioration in the us and global economies  and as a reaction to the concurrent sharp drop in product prices 
in an effort to manage the build up of excess inventory  and to control costs  we elected to idle one of our ethylene units in lake charles  louisiana that was scheduled for a major maintenance turnaround in the first quarter of the maintenance work is being performed early during this downtime and the facility is expected to resume operations in the first quarter of the fourth quarter of gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately million due to the inventory losses and the expensing of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs related to the drop in operating rates 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by million  which is a direct result of the current economic environment 
compared with net sales 
net sales increased by million to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to higher average sales prices for all of our major products and higher sales volumes for pvc resin  partially offset by lower sales volumes for polyethylene and pvc pipe 
average sales prices for increased by as compared to overall sales volume decreased by in as compared to gross profit 
gross profit percentage decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to the inventory losses and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs of approximately million recorded in the fourth quarter of our raw material costs in both segments normally track industry prices  which experienced an increase of for ethane and for propane in as compared to in addition  we experienced a million loss in connection with trading activity for compared to a million loss for  an unfavorable change of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to a million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts  directly attributable to the current economic environment 
this increase was partially offset by transition costs related to the acquisition of the longview facilities incurred in the first four months of and a reduction in legal expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense in increased by million to million from million in  primarily due to higher average debt outstanding for the period  largely as a result of our issuance of the senior notes in the fourth quarter of other income  net 
other income  net increased by million to million in from million in primarily due to higher interest income from the restricted cash balance associated with our senior notes  higher equity income from our joint venture in china and a million write down of a long term investment in income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was in as compared to in the tax rate was above the statutory rate of primarily due to state tax credits and a reduction of gross unrecognized tax benefits  partially offset by state income taxes  all being applied to a loss before income taxes 
the tax rate was below the statutory rate of primarily due to state tax credits  a reduction in deferred taxes due to a change in apportionment ratios upon the reorganization of several subsidiaries and the domestic manufacturing deduction  partially offset by state income taxes 

table of contents olefins segment net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to higher sales prices for all major products  partially offset by lower sales volumes for polyethylene 
average sales prices for the olefins segment increased by in from income from operations 
income from operations decreased by million to a loss of million in from income of million in this decrease was primarily due to a loss from operations of million in the fourth quarter of during which lower production  weakened product demand and a sharp drop in industry pricing resulted in negative margins 
industry polyethylene prices fell from september  to december  due to the collapse in energy and feedstock costs in the fourth quarter 
as a result of utilizing the fifo method of inventory accounting and the unprecedented drop in feedstock costs and product prices in the fourth quarter  we had very high feedstock costs recorded in our cost of sales in the fourth quarter of while our product prices were based on current costs 
other contributing factors for the decrease in included an increase in feedstock  natural gas and electricity costs in the first nine months of due to market conditions  we were unable to increase prices to fully compensate for increased costs 
additionally  the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike  which caused two separate outages at the lake charles plant during the third quarter of  lower sales volumes for polyethylene and a trading loss of million in as compared to a trading loss of million in in addition  these decreases in operating income were only partially offset by higher average sales prices in results for were negatively impacted by a major turnaround and an unscheduled outage at our lake charles ethylene units 
vinyls segment net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to higher sales prices for all major products and increased pvc resin sales volumes 
average sales prices for the vinyls segment increased by in as compared to these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes for vcm and fabricated products 
income from operations 
income from operations decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to weakness in the construction market  which continues to negatively affect demand and product pricing in our vinyls downstream businesses 
in addition  the closure of our pawling  new york facility in the first quarter of and the idling of our van buren pvc pipe plant in the fourth quarter of negatively impacted income from operations as severance  asset impairments and other related costs totaled approximately million in partially offsetting these decreases were higher margins for caustic 
results for were negatively impacted by million due to a legal settlement and expenses associated with the litigation 
compared with net sales 
net sales increased by million to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes for polyethylene  ethylene  caustic and pvc resin 
polyethylene sales volumes were significantly higher in as compared to primarily due to the acquisition of the longview facility 
these increases were partially offset by overall lower average sales prices 
gross margin 
gross margin percentage decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to lower average sales prices for our products and higher cost of raw materials 
our raw material costs in both segments normally track industry prices  which experienced an increase of for ethane and for propane in as compared to in addition  we had a million loss in connection with trading activity for compared to a million gain for  a decrease of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to transition costs and other operating expenses related to the acquisition of the longview facility and increased legal fees  largely related to the goodrich and polyone litigation 
interest expense 
interest expense in increased by million to million from million in  primarily due to higher average debt outstanding for the period 
debt retirement cost 
as a result of the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due july  and the repayment of million of our term loan  we recognized million in non operating expense in the first quarter of  consisting of a pre payment premium on our senior notes of million and a write off of million in previously capitalized debt issuance cost 
we did not recognize any debt retirement costs in other income  net 
other income  net decreased by million to million in from million in primarily due to lower interest income associated with lower cash balances and the write down of a long term investment 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was in as compared to in the tax rate was below the statutory rate of primarily due to state tax credits  a reduction in deferred taxes due to a change in apportionment ratios upon the reorganization of several subsidiaries and the domestic manufacturing deduction  partially offset by state income taxes 
the tax rate was below the statutory rate of primarily due to adjustments to state income taxes and the extra territorial exclusion income benefit 
olefins segment net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to increased polyethylene and ethylene volumes 
the significant increase in polyethylene sales volumes was primarily due to increased volume from our longview facility  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of in addition  average sales prices for the olefins segment increased by in from income from operations 
income from operations decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a significant increase in raw material costs and a trading loss of million in as compared to a trading gain of million in these decreases in operating income were almost entirely offset by earnings from our longview facility which was acquired in november there were several price increases during for our major olefins products  but margins were still below levels due to higher feedstock costs 
results for the period were negatively impacted by an unscheduled outage at our lake charles ethylene facility 
vinyls segment net sales 
net sales decreased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for most of our major vinyls products 
the decreased sales prices were partially offset by higher sales volumes for pvc resin and caustic 
average selling prices for the vinyls segment decreased by in as compared to income from operations 
income from operations decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for pvc resin and pvc pipe  and higher feedstock costs which was partially offset by higher sales volumes for pvc resin and caustic soda 
margins and demand in the first nine months of were very strong due to supply constraints resulting from the impact from hurricanes katrina and rita 
selling prices  margins and sales volumes for pvc 
table of contents resin and pvc pipe fell dramatically in the fourth quarter of due to weakness in the construction market  falling energy prices and seasonal slowdowns 
these margins remained under pressure during due to the continued weakness in the construction market  higher feedstock costs and the inability to raise prices for our downstream products in response to these higher costs 
cash flows operating activities operating activities provided cash of million in compared to million in the million increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital  partially offset by lower income from operations in and higher turnaround costs

in august  we announced the construction of a new chlor alkali plant at our geismar  louisiana facility 
we expect this project will cost between million and million and will be partially funded with funds drawn from the proceeds of the issuance of the revenue bonds of the authority  issued in december for our benefit  which are currently held as restricted cash 
the remaining funding will depend on our revolving credit facility  cash flow from operations and  possibly  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 
we believe that our sources of liquidity as described above will be adequate to fund our normal operations and on going capital expenditures 
in addition  in response to the declining economic conditions  we have increased our focus on cost cutting and working capital reduction to improve our liquidity 
funding of any potential large expansions or any potential acquisitions of third party assets may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 
as of december   the indenture governing our senior notes restricted us from incurring additional debt  except for specified permitted debt including borrowings under our credit facility  additional borrowings under one or more term loan facilities in an amount not to exceed million and million of other debt  because our fixed charge coverage ratio fell below at december  we may not be able to access additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates due to the volatility of the commercial credit markets 
despite the current economic downturn and the credit crisis  our management believes that our revolving credit facility should be available up to our borrowing capacity  if needed 
at december   the borrowing base of our credit facility has declined to million  which is below the maximum borrowing capacity of million due to our low carrying amount of accounts receivable and inventory  which make up the borrowing base 

table of contents cash and restricted cash total cash balances were million at december   which included cash and cash equivalents of million and restricted cash of million

the senior notes evidence and secure our obligations to the authority under a loan agreement relating to the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of the authority s tax exempt revenue bonds 
debt outstanding under the tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds bears interest at variable rates 
on september   we amended our senior secured revolving credit facility to  among other things  increase the lenders commitments under the facility from million to million 
on february   we further amended our revolving credit facility to allow us to make specified distributions when our fixed charge coverage ratio falls below but we maintain at least million to million depending on the amount of the distribution of borrowing availability  including cash  under the credit facility 
at december   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
subsequent to the latest amendment  any borrowings under the facility would bear interest at either libor plus or the prime rate plus 
the revolving credit facility also requires an unused commitment fee ranging from to  depending on our average daily borrowings 
all interest rates under the facility are subject to quarterly grid pricing adjustments based on average daily loan availability 
the facility matures on september  as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and loan availability of million under the facility 
on december  the authority issued million of tax exempt revenue bonds due november  under the gulf opportunity zone act of the bonds are non callable through november  the bonds are subject to redemption and the holders may require the bonds to be repurchased upon a change of control or a change in or loss of the current tax status 
in connection with the issuance of the bonds  we entered into a loan agreement with the authority pursuant to which we agreed to pay all of the principal  premium  if any  and interest on the bonds and certain other amounts to the authority 
the proceeds from the bond offering were loaned by the authority to us 
we intend to use the proceeds to expand  refurbish and maintain certain of our facilities in the louisiana parishes of calcasieu and ascension 
to evidence and secure our obligations under the loan agreement  we entered into a second supplemental indenture  by and among us  the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and the bank of new york trust company  na  as trustee  and issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due to be held by the trustee pursuant to the terms and provisions of the loan agreement 
the senior notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with other existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 
all domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of ours or of another guarantor of the senior notes in excess of million are guarantors of the senior notes 
as of december   we had drawn million of bond proceeds 
the balance of the proceeds  principal plus current and accrued interest income  remains with a trustee  and is classified on our consolidated balance sheet as a non current asset  restricted cash  until such time as we request reimbursement of amounts used to expand  refurbish and maintain our facilities in calcasieu and ascension parishes 
on january   we issued million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes are unsecured and were issued with an original issue discount of million 
there is no sinking fund and no scheduled amortization of the notes prior to maturity 
the notes are subject to redemption and the holders may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change of control 
all domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of ours or of another guarantor of the senior notes in excess of million are guarantors of the notes 

table of contents the agreements governing the and the senior notes together the senior notes and the revolving credit facility each contain customary covenants and events of default 
accordingly  these agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions  among other things  provide limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of dividends  certain investments and acquisitions and sales of assets 
one such restriction currently restricts us from incurring additional debt  except specified permitted debt including borrowings under our credit facility  because our fixed charge coverage ratio fell below at december  these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions  including  without limitation  an exception for the payment of our regular quarterly dividend of up to per share currently per share 
the senior notes indenture does not allow distributions  unless  after giving pro forma effect to the distribution  our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least and such payment  together with the aggregate amount of all other distributions after january   is less than the sum of of our consolidated net income for the period from october  to the end of the most recent quarter for which financial statements have been filed  plus of net cash proceeds received after october  as a contribution to our common equity capital or from the issuance or sale of certain securities  plus several other adjustments 
the amount allowed under this restriction would have been million at december   however  because our fixed charge coverage ratio was below  the actual amount allowed was restricted to the payment of our regular quarterly dividend of up to per share 
the revolving credit facility also restricts distributions unless  after giving effect to such payment  our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least  provided that we may also make specified distributions when our fixed charge coverage ratio falls below but we maintain at least between million to million depending on the amount of the distributions of borrowing availability  including cash  under the credit facility 
no other agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios 
in addition  the senior notes indenture and the revolving credit facility restrict our ability to create liens  to engage in certain affiliate transactions and to engage in sale leaseback transactions 
in december  we entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the parish of calcasieu  louisiana 
the public trust issued million principal amount of tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds revenue bonds in order to finance our construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant 
the revenue bonds expire in december and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions 
interest on the revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly 
the interest rate on the revenue bonds at december  and was and  respectively 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments in addition to long term debt  we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations 
the following table summarizes our minimum payments as of december  relating to long term debt  operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and interest payments for the next five years and thereafter 
the amounts do not include pension liabilities  post retirement medical liabilities  deferred charges and other items classified in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet due to the uncertainty of the future payment schedule

long term debt consists of the senior notes  the senior notes and the tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds 
operating leases 
we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases primarily related to rail car leases and land for various periods 
unconditional purchase obligations 
we are party to various unconditional obligations to purchase products and services  primarily including commitments to purchase ethylene  power  nitrogen  oxygen  wastewater treatment services  product storage and pipeline usage 
the ethylene obligation included above is based on a december  price and is subject to price variation in the future 
we also have various purchase commitments for materials  supplies and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business which may not be unconditional and are not reflected in the table above 
interest payments 
interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at december  and assume contractual amortization payments 
standby letters of credit

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions 
we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate 

table of contents we apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events  consistent with gaap 
our more critical accounting policies include those related to long lived assets  accruals for long term employee benefits  inventories  accounts receivable and environmental and legal obligations 
inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates 
we periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer upon delivery under executed customer purchase orders or contracts 
for export contracts  the title and risk of loss passes to customers at the time specified by each contract 
provisions for discounts  rebates and returns are provided for in the same period as the related sales are recorded 
long lived assets 
key estimates related to long lived assets include useful lives  recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations and such estimates could be significantly modified 
the carrying values of long lived assets could be impaired by new technological developments  new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages  uncertainties associated with the us and world economies  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses 
actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated 
additionally  future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long lived assets of our businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the estimated useful lives of long lived assets range from three to years 
depreciation and amortization of these assets  including amortization of deferred turnaround costs  under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation charges would be accelerated 
we defer the costs of major turnaround maintenance and repair activities and amortize the costs over the period until the next expected major turnaround of the affected unit 
in  we had a major turnaround at our styrene facility in lake charles 
in  we had a major turnaround at one of our ethylene units at our lake charles facility 
in  we had a major turnaround at our calvert city facility and at one of our ethylene units in lake charles 
total costs deferred on these turnarounds were million in  million in and million in amortization in  and of previously deferred turnaround costs was million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   capitalized turnaround costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million 
expensing turnaround costs would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
additional information concerning long lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
fair value estimates 
we develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in those acquisitions  to assess impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets and to record derivative instruments and certain other elected assets 
under the purchase method of accounting  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations  including the 
table of contents engagement of third party consultants 
as of december   our recorded goodwill was million  all of which was associated with the acquisition of our longview facilities 
in addition  we record all derivative instruments and certain inventory balances associated with our trading strategy at fair value 
the fair value of these items is determined by quoted market prices or from observable market based inputs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
long term employee benefit costs 
our costs for long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits  are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is our responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties 
it is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and  if necessary  adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors 
accounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match  for each employee  that estimated cost to the period worked 
to accomplish this  we rely extensively on advice from actuaries  and assumptions are made about inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates 
assumed healthcare trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans because benefits for participants are capped at a fixed amount 
additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
inventories 
inventories primarily include product  materials and supplies 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
the use of other methods  such as lifo  could result in differing amounts being reported as inventories and cost of sales depending on price changes and sales turnover levels 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in our determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  and consistent with our accounting policy  we estimate the amount of accounts receivable that we believe are unlikely to be collected and we record an expense of that amount 
estimating this amount requires us to analyze the financial strength of our customers  and  in our analysis  we combine the use of historical experience  our accounts receivable aged trial balance and specific collectibility analysis 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
balances over days past due and accounts determined by our analysis of financial strength of customers to be high risk are reviewed individually for collectibility 
by its nature  such an estimate is highly subjective and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated 
income taxes 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes 
deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period 
valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
environmental and legal obligations 
we consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings 
we accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
while we believe that the 
table of contents amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 
additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
our strategies include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable 
we use derivative instruments in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products 
based on our open derivative positions at december   a hypothetical increase in the price of a gallon of ethane would have decreased our income before taxes by million and a hypothetical increase in the price of a mmbtu of natural gas would have decreased our income before taxes by million 
additional information concerning derivative commodity instruments appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had variable rate debt of million outstanding 
all of the debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility none was outstanding at december  and tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds is at variable rates 
we do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt  but we may do so in the future 
the interest rate for our variable rate debt of million as of december  was 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
also  at december   we had million principal amount of fixed rate debt 
we are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced 
if interest rates are higher at the time of refinancing  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million
