item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview align technology  inc designs  manufactures and markets the invisalign system  a proprietary method for treating malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth 
invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear  nearly invisible  removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position 
because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires  invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with metal arch wires and brackets  commonly referred to as braces 
we received the united states food and drug administration fda clearance to market invisalign in the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device 
each invisalign treatment plan is unique to the individual patient 
our invisalign full treatment consists of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctors treatment goals 
our invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten sets of aligners 
invisalign express treatment is intended to assist dental professionals to treat a broader range of patients by providing a lower cost option for adult relapse cases  for minor crowding and spacing  or as a pre cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers 
invisalign teen  which was launched in july  is designed to meet the specific needs of the non adult comprehensive or teen treatment market 
invisalign assist  launched in october  is intended to help newly trained and low volume invisalign gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice 
upon completion of an invisalign or non invisalign treatment  the patient may be prescribed our traditional retainer product  or our vivera retainers  a clear aligner set designed for ongoing retention 
our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the four key objectives driving product innovation  enhancing the customer experience  generating consumer demand and expanding into international markets 
each of these four key objectives is described more fully in item i business business strategy of this annual report on form k and is incorporated herein by this reference 
in addition to whether we successfully execute our business strategy  a number of other factors  the most important of which are set forth below  may affect our results during the remainder of and beyond 
impact on consumer spending due to a decline in general economic conditions 
consumer spending habits are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  gas prices  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
a general slowdown in the united states economy and certain international economies as well as an uncertain economic outlook have adversely affected consumer spending habits 
as a result of the decline in general economic conditions  we expect that our product volumes and revenues may decline in compared to in addition  the decline in general economic conditions may further have the impact of decreasing the number of orthodontic case starts overall 
utilization rates 
our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption and frequency of use by dental 
table of contents professionals  or utilization 
our quarterly utilization rates from the years ended december   and are as follows utilization rates chart utilization rates of cases shipped divided by of doctors cases were shipped to as set forth in the chart above  year over year utilization rates declined slightly for our domestic channel in each quarter of compared to the same quarter in we believe that the continued economic slowdown has negatively impacted many of our north america customers 
international utilization rates for the same periods  however  increased slightly 
impact of new products on deferred revenue 
we launched three new products in vivera retainers in january  invisalign teen in july  and invisalign assist in october as a result of and depending upon customer adoption of these new products  we expect our mix of products to begin shifting gradually 
key features of these new products include staged delivery of retainers with vivera  up to six free individual replacement aligners with invisalign teen and staged delivery of aligners with invisalign assist 
as a result of these features  these new products will have a significantly higher amount of deferred revenue as a percentage of their average selling prices compared to invisalign full 
the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year  and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and then recognized as each shipment occurs 
revenue for the six replacement aligners included in invisalign teen will be deferred based on their fair market value until the earlier of the replacement aligners being used or until the case is completed 
for invisalign assist  when the progress tracking feature is selected  aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages 
as a result  for these cases  revenue will be deferred upon the first staged shipment and will be recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment 
in addition  included in the price of invisalign full treatment  we offer case refinement  which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient s teeth to the desired final position 
invisalign teen  invisalign assist  and invisalign full include a deferral for case refinement 
as these new products increase as a percentage of our total case volume  deferred revenue on our balance sheet will increase 
reliance on international manufacturing operations 
our manufacturing efficiency has been and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability 
currently  two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica  dental technicians use a sophisticated  internally developed computer modeling program to prepare digital treatment plans 
we currently rely on ims  a third party shelter services provider located in juarez  mexico  for order acquisition  to fabricate aligner molds as well as finished 
table of contents aligners and to ship the completed product to customers 
on december   we notified ims of our intention to terminate this shelter services arrangement effective in april at that time  we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in juarez  mexico 
our success will depend in part on the efforts and abilities of management to effectively manage these international operations  including any difficulties encountered by us with respect to a transition from a third party shelter services arrangement to a direct manufacturer  including difficulties hiring and retaining qualified personnel 
if our management fails in any of these respects  we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 
in addition  even if we have case submissions  we may not have a sufficient number of trained dental technicians in costa rica to create the clincheck treatments  or if we are unable to ship our product to our customers on a timely basis  our revenue will be delayed or lost  which will cause our operating results to fluctuate 
see part i  item a risk factors for risks related to our international operations as well as risks related to transitioning from reliance on shelter service arrangement to independent manufacturer 
seasonal fluctuations 
seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected  and are likely to continue to affect  our business 
specifically  our customers often take vacation or are on holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases 
these seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause  fluctuations in our quarterly results  including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 
foreign exchange rates 
although the us dollar is our reporting currency  a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies 
revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by changes in exchange rates 
we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchanges rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements 
restructurings 
during  we announced restructuring plans in july and october to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower the overall cost structure 
in july  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our full time headcount by employees including initiating a phased consolidation of order acquisition operations from our corporate headquarters in santa clara  california to juarez  mexico  which was completed by the end of the october restructuring plan included a total reduction of full time headcount in santa clara  california by july as we create a new shared services organization in our existing costa rica facility that will consolidate customer care  accounts receivable  credit and collections  and customer event registration organizations  which are currently located in santa clara  california 
we anticipate phasing the relocation to costa rica in an attempt to minimize disruptions to customer service levels and expect the relocation to be completed by the end of july these actions resulted in a restructuring charge of approximately million in  and we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately million over the first half of we expect to reinvest the annualized savings of these two restructurings in the execution of our key strategic initiatives 
see part i  item a risk factors for risks related to the october restructuring  including the phased relocation of our customer facing operations to costa rica 
review of our investment portfolio and policies 
our cash equivalent and short term investment portfolio as of the date of this form k consisted of us government notes and bonds  corporate bonds and certificates of deposits  agency bonds and discount notes and commercial paper 
we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor  manage and 
table of contents limit our exposure to interest rate  liquidity and credit risk 
the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer  as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes 
as a result of current adverse financial market conditions  investments in some financial instruments  such as structured investment vehicles  sub prime mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations  may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns 
as of the date of this form k  we had no direct holdings in these categories of investments and our indirect exposure to these financial instruments through our holdings in money market mutual funds was immaterial 
as of the date of this form k  we had no impairment charge associated with our short term investment portfolio relating to such adverse financial market conditions 
although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment  we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 
see part i  item a risk factors for risks related to global financial and securities markets 
our short term marketable securities as of december  are as follows in thousands december  amortized costs gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value us government notes and bonds corporate bonds and certificates of deposit agency bonds and discount notes commercial paper total our long term marketable securities as of december  are as follows in thousands september  amortized costs gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value agency bonds corporate bonds total tax valuation allowance 
we continually evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in assessing our need for a tax valuation allowance 
as a result of our analysis  we released the tax valuation allowance on most of the deferred tax assets with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december  effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings 
stock based compensation 
we implemented statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
revised  share based payment fas r in  and we expect stock based compensation to increase until at least  which corresponds to our standard year vesting term 
thereafter  new grants will be expensed over the vesting period  however  this expense may be offset by fully vested grants that are no longer expensed 
for the years 
table of contents ended december   and  stock based compensation expense recognized in accordance with fas r is as follows in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  stock based compensation of net revenues stock based compensation of net revenues stock based compensation of net revenues cost of revenues sales and marketing general and administrative research and development total stock based compensation expense results of operations comparison of years ended december   and net revenues invisalign product revenues by channel and other revenues  which represent training and sales of ancillary products for the years ended december   and  are as follows years ended december  net revenues net change change net change change in millions north america ortho gp total north american invisalign international invisalign total invisalign revenues other revenues total net revenues case volume data which represents invisalign case shipments by channel  for the years ended december   and are as follows years ended december  invisalign case volume net change change net change change in thousands north america ortho gp total north american invisalign international invisalign total invisalign case volume 
table of contents total net revenues increased in compared to primarily as a result of increased growth in our international invisalign revenue and our north american gp revenue 
net revenues from our north american invisalign orthodontic channel decreased in compared to due to decreased case volume and higher revenue deferrals related to new products introduced in partially offset by lower participation in volume based discount program rebates 
net revenues from our north american invisalign gp channel increased due to higher case volume and lower participation in volume based discount rebate programs 
revenues from both our north american orthodontic and gp channels increased in compared to primarily as a result of an overall increase in case volume and a favorable product mix shift towards invisalign full 
this product mix shift towards invisalign full began in the fourth quarter of after we removed the cancellation fees on invisalign full cases prior to clincheck approval and clarified clinical protocols surrounding what is an appropriate invisalign express case 
the increase in invisalign full revenues is partially offset by increased participation in our volume based discount programs 
the increase in our international invisalign revenues in compared to was predominantly due to higher case volumes partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates and increased participation in volume based discount programs 
the increase in our international invisalign revenues in compared to was attributable to an increase in case volume 
additionally  our international revenues benefited from favorable exchange rates in these increases were partially offset by increased participation in volume based discount programs 
other revenues  consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products  were lower in compared to primarily due to north american training discount programs 
other revenues were higher in compared to as a result of an increased number of doctors trained year over year 
for  we expect our total net revenues to decrease compared to primarily due to case volume decreases in north america partially offset by expected growth in international revenue 
we expect our mix of products to continue to shift in due to the introduction of new products during the second half of these new products have a significantly higher amount of deferred revenue as a percentage of their average selling price compared to invisalign full 
cost of revenues and gross margin years ended december  change change in millions cost of revenues of net revenues gross profit gross margin cost of revenues includes salaries for staff involved in the production process  costs incurred by ims  a third party shelter service provider in juarez  mexico  the cost of materials  packaging  shipping costs  depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process  training costs and stock based compensation expense 
gross margin improved in compared to primarily due to an increase in case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure and improved operating efficiencies 
gross margin improved in compared to primarily as a result of increased case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure resulting in decreases in our per unit standard cost 
additionally  
table of contents cost reductions from improved operating efficiencies also contributed to the increase in gross margin 
we believe that gross margin in will be slightly lower than in as we expect overall case volume to decrease year over year partially offset by a benefit from our transition from a third party shelter arrangement to direct manufacturing in juarez  mexico effective april however  with our relatively fixed manufacturing cost structure  quarterly gross margin will fluctuate based on case volume and product mix 
in addition  should we experience continuing unfavorable exchange rates  our gross margin may be adversely affected 
sales and marketing years ended december  change change in millions sales and marketing of net revenues sales and marketing expense includes sales force compensation including travel related costs  marketing personnel related costs  media and advertising  clinical education  product marketing and stock based compensation expense 
sales and marketing expense increased during compared to due to higher payroll related expenses of million  including stock based compensation of million  as a result of the full year effect of additional headcount hired in the fourth quarter of we also incurred higher product marketing expenses of million  associated with our new product launches and commercialization  professional marketing programs  clinical education and media costs 
our sales and marketing expense increased during compared to predominantly as a result of a million increase in media  advertising and product marketing expenses and an increase in payroll related expenses of million  of which million was attributable to additional headcount and million to stock based compensation 
we expect sales and marketing expense levels in to be comparable to in  we expect to invest in our international channel  including consumer advertising and sales force expansion  and continue commercialization of new products in north america  offset by benefits from the transition of our shared services organizations to costa rica  beginning in the second half of general and administrative years ended december  change change in millions general and administrative of net revenues general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel  outside consulting services  legal expenses and stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses increased during compared to primarily due to higher payroll related expenses of million  including increased stock based compensation expense of million  resulting from additional headcount 
management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management resulting in an asset impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of in addition  legal and other professional fees were 
table of contents higher by million compared to primarily due to a million credit in from an insurance reimbursement we received associated with the orthoclear litigation 
general and administrative expense decreased in compared to largely due to a million decline in external legal fees following the settlement of the orthoclear litigation in the fourth quarter of as mentioned above  our legal expense included a million credit for an insurance reimbursement of legal costs also associated with the orthoclear litigation 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in additional headcount and incentive compensation  a million increase in consulting fees  and a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
additionally  amortization expense increased million in compared to related to the amortization of the non compete agreements we received in connection with the orthoclear settlement 
we expect general and administrative expense in to be lower than levels as we begin to benefit from the transition of our shared services organizations to costa rica  beginning in the second half of research and development years ended december  change change in millions research and development of net revenues research and development expense includes the personnel related costs and outside consulting expenses associated with the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products  conducting clinical and post marketing trials and stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses increased slightly in compared to the same period in primarily due to higher payroll related expenses  including stock based compensation  as a result of increased headcount in the first half of  partially offset by lower consulting fees 
research and development expense increased in compared to predominantly from a million increase resulting from higher headcount and incentive compensation 
additionally  a million increase in outside services also contributed to the increase in research and development costs 
we expect research and development expense in to be lower than levels as a result of lower headcount and reduced consulting expenses 
restructurings years ended december  change change in millions restructurings of net revenues n a during  we announced restructuring plans in july and october to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower the overall cost structure 
in july  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our full time headcount by employees including a phased consolidation of order acquisition operations from our corporate headquarters in santa clara  california to juarez  mexico  which was completed by the end of the october restructuring plan included a total reduction of full time headcount in santa clara  california by july as we move customer care  accounts 
table of contents receivable  credit and collections  and customer event registration organizations in santa clara  california to our existing facilities in costa rica 
in  we incurred approximately million in restructuring expenses relating to these actions which includes million related to the acceleration of stock option vesting and million related to severance and termination benefits  of which million was paid during the year 
we are phasing in the relocation to costa rica of our shared services group in an attempt to minimize disruptions to customer service levels and expect the relocation to be completed by july we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately million during the first half of patients first program and settlement costs years ended december  change change in millions patients first program settlement costs total patients first program and settlement costs of net revenues as part of the orthoclear agreement in october  orthoclear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the united states and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide 
as a result  most orthoclear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with orthoclear 
in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the orthoclear patients and their doctors  we committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the patients first program 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program 
subsequently  in the first quarter of  we reduced our patients first program accrual by million to reflect a reduction of our initial estimate to the number of cases actually received by the case submission deadline 
we shipped all patients first program cases by june  we paid million to orthoclear during the fourth quarter of in accordance with the terms of the orthoclear agreement  of which million was capitalized on our balance sheet representing the fair value of the non compete agreements and is being amortized over years 
in accordance with emerging issues task force accounting for pre existing contractual relationships between the parties to a purchase business combination eitf  we recorded the remaining million as settlement costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest and other income expense  net years ended december  change change in millions interest income interest expense other income expense  net total interest and other income expense  net 
table of contents interest and other income expense  net  includes interest income earned on cash balances  interest expense on debt  foreign currency translation gains and losses and other miscellaneous charges 
interest income  net in decreased by million compared to primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances resulting from the million stock repurchase program and lower interest rates 
in  we shifted our investments into more conservative instruments principally  us government securities  which bear lower interest rates 
we incurred no interest expense in compared to in we incurred interest expense on the outstanding balance of our line of credit during which was repaid during we had no outstanding borrowings as of december  other income expense  net  increased in compared to reflecting increases in foreign currency translation losses 
interest income  net increased in compared to primarily due to higher average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in other income expense  net  decreased in compared to reflecting the decrease in foreign currency translation gains 
in january  we began to record the adjustments from translating certain european subsidiaries financial statements from the local currency into the us dollar as a separate component of shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the heading currency rate risk for additional information on the change in functional currency 
provision for benefit from income taxes years ended december  change change in millions provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million for and income tax provisions of million and million for and  respectively 
these represented effective tax rates of   and  in  and  respectively 
our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction 
we exercised significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth  forecasted earnings and projected taxable income  in determining the provision for income taxes  and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future benefit from deferred tax assets 
at december   based on available positive evidence  we determined that most of our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as we cannot forecast sufficient future capital gains or foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets 
therefore  we recorded a tax valuation allowance release of million in the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million relating to capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december   will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  these carryforwards will begin to expire in for federal purposes and for california purposes 
fas r prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 
such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled million as of december  and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital  if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes 
table of contents payable 
the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporation s tax attributes if a corporation undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes 
if an ownership change is determined to have occurred  our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation 
however  based on our current estimate of the total net operating losses at december  and our current estimate of the annual limitation  we do not expect our net operating loss carryforwards to be limited 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
we have not provided additional us income taxes on undistributed earnings from non us operations as of december  because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations from product sales  the proceeds of the sale of our common stock  and from occasional borrowings under our available credit facility 
as of december   and  we had the following cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments years ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term investments total net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  resulting primarily from our net profit of million and non cash items totaling million  which included depreciation  amortization of intangibles  option acceleration charges for terminated executives and stock based compensation expense 
also included in non cash items was an asset impairment charge of million relating to management s decision to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management 
these increases were offset by the release of a non cash tax valuation allowance of million on most of the deferred tax assets 
cash flows from operating activities also resulted from a million increase in deferred revenue and a million decrease in inventories 
these increases in cash flows were offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  resulting primarily from our net income of million and non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and amortization of intangibles totaling million 
additionally  a million increase in accounts payable also contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
these increases in cash flows from operating activities were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  resulting primarily from our net loss of million and non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and amortization of intangibles totaling million 
additionally  a million increase in current assets and a million reduction in deferred revenue partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also contributed to the cash used in operating activities 
the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to the 
table of contents million accrual as of december  for the anticipated costs of completing the patients first program 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and consisted of million for the purchase of property and equipment offset by million of net maturities of marketable securities 
as a result of current adverse financial market conditions  investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns 
although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment  we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   which largely consisted of million of net purchases of short term marketable securities and million used for the purchase of capital assets 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to a million purchase of intangible assets resulting from the orthoclear agreement  million for the purchase of capital assets and million for net purchases of short term marketable securities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and resulted primarily from our million stock repurchase including commissions offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock  principally from exercises of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and consisted of million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock  primarily from exercises of employee stock options 
this increase was partially offset by the repayment of million against the outstanding balance on our line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and consisted of million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock  primarily from exercises of employee stock options and million in net borrowings from our line of credit 
net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity 
however  in  we began granting restricted stock units rsus which  unlike stock options  do not generate cash from exercise 
as a result  we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods 
in addition  because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest  the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf 
during and  we paid million and million of taxes related to rsus that vested during the period for executive officers 
on december   we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank 
under this revolving line of credit  we have million of available borrowings with a maturity date of december  this credit facility requires a quick ratio covenant and also requires us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of million 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and we were in compliance with the financial covenant of this credit facility 
on april   we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program of up to million 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million including commissions 
as of december   we had completed repurchases under the stock repurchase authorization 

table of contents contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations computer support services total in july  we entered into an agreement in favor of and for the benefit of elamex de juarez  sa de sa  or elamex  landlord to ims  our third party shelter services provider 
under this agreement  we guarantee ims lease payments for its facility located in juarez  mexico 
the monthly rent for this  square foot facility is  and the lease expires in july pursuant to the guarantee  we are obligated to pay elamex for any rental payments in default by ims 
during the year ended december   there were no rental payment defaults by ims 
on december   we notified ims of our intention to terminate ims shelter services arrangement effective april at that time  we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in juarez  mexico and we will also assume ims lease with elamex 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item a as of december  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows  we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy  business structure or operations 
accordingly  the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab  and emerging issues task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are recognized from product sales  net of discounts and rebates 
service revenues related to the training of dental professionals and staff on the invisalign treatment process are recorded when the services are completed 
we enter into arrangements that involve multiple product deliveries in the future 
included in the price of invisalign full  invisalign teen and invisalign assist  we offer case refinement  which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient s teeth to the desired final position 
case refinement may be elected by the dental professional in the last stages of orthodontic treatment 
we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement deliverable and recognize the residual revenue upon shipment 
we defer the fair value of case refinement upon shipment based on a breakage factor  which is determined by sufficient historical experience of case refinement utilization 
we believe that the use of a breakage factor is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of case refinement utilization since case refinement was first offered 
actual utilization rates could differ from the historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to revenue 
revenues are deferred for certain products that include staged delivery 
depending on the product  revenues are recognized based on usage  case completion  ratably over a delivery period or upon shipment of the final staged shipment 
revenue for the six replacement aligners included in invisalign teen is deferred based on the fair market value until the earlier of replacement aligners being used or until the case is completed 
the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year  and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and recognized ratably over the one year delivery period 
for invisalign assist  when the progress tracking feature is selected  aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages 
for these cases  revenue is deferred upon the first staged shipment and will be recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment 
we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales  if any  in the period such sales occur 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 
stock based compensation expense we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
revised  share based payment fas r in accordingly  we recognize compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term and stock price volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment

long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives  unless these lives are determined to be indefinite

long lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
we perform an impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or circumstances include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses 
management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management resulting in an asset impairment charge of million which was recorded in general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of no intangible asset impairment was recorded for the periods presented 
deferred tax valuation allowance we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of  with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  we determined that it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  we released the tax valuation allowance on most of the deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  as of december   we believed that the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be realized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
our cash equivalents and investments are in fixed rate  short term securities 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  and as a result  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to 
table of contents changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had million invested in available for sale marketable securities 
an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 
we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december  and therefore  we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases 
currency rate risk we operate in north america  europe  asia pacific  costa rica and japan 
as a result of our international business activities  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets  and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
we sell our products in the local currency for the respective country 
this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below 
regardless of this natural hedging  our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  where appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions 
the impact of an aggregate decline of in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material 
prior to january   the functional currency of align and our subsidiaries was the us dollar  and accordingly  gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in euros  costa rican colones  and other currencies were reflected in other income expense 
during the first quarter of  we analyzed the various economic factors of our international subsidiaries in accordance with fas and determined that there had been a significant change in facts and circumstances to warrant a change in the functional currency for some of our european subsidiaries from the us dollar to the local currency 
effective january   the adjustment from translating certain european subsidiaries financial statements from the local currency into the us dollar was recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net in the stockholder s equity section of our consolidated balance sheets
