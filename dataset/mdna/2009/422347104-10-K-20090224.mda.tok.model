overview heartland express  inc is a short to medium haul truckload carrier 
the company transports freight for major shippers and generally earns revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered 
the company operated ten regional operating divisions that provided regional dry van truckload services from eight regional operating centers in addition to its corporate headquarters during the company s ten regional operating divisions  not including operations at the corporate headquarters  accounted for and of the and operating revenues 
the company s newest regional operating center near dallas  texas opened in early january and increased the company s regional operating centers to nine and regional operating divisions to eleven  in addition to operations at the company s corporate headquarters 
the company takes pride in the quality of the service that it provides to its customers 
the keys to maintaining a high level of service are the availability of late model equipment and experienced drivers 
operating efficiencies and cost controls are achieved through equipment utilization  operating a fleet of late model equipment  maintaining an industry leading driver to non driver employee ratio  and the effective management of fixed and variable operating costs 
as fuel prices soared to historical highs during  management of fuel cost became a top priority of management 
the industry experienced soft freight demand throughout the year which forced downward pressures on freight rates and fuel surcharge rates 
the unseasonably low freight demand the company experienced through the fourth quarter of has continued into the first quarter of the challenging freight environment throughout the year combined with record high fuel prices  resulted in many carriers in the trucking industry declaring bankruptcy and or exiting the industry 
the industry continues to fight excess capacity in the market place along with declining freight volumes due to the current economic downturn 
during the company undertook fuel initiative strategies to effectively manage fuel costs 
these initiatives included  encouraging fueling at terminal locations rather than over the road purchases to take advantage of bulk fuel purchases when cost effective to do so  reduction of tractor idle time and controlling out of route miles 
although the company experienced declining fuel costs throughout the second half of  company management continues to encourage these initiatives 
at december   the company s tractor fleet had an average age of years while the trailer fleet had an average age of years 
the company continues to focus on growing internally by providing quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in the company s regional operating areas 
in addition to the development of its regional operating centers  the company has made five acquisitions since quality service allowed the company to hold its freight rates stable throughout future growth is dependent upon several factors including the level of economic growth and the related customer demand  the available capacity in the trucking industry  potential of acquisition opportunities  and the availability of experienced drivers

the company s cash flow from operations for the year of million was of operating revenues 
the company used million in net investing cash flows  mainly due to the purchase of new revenue equipment  and million in financing activities  which was made up of million in stock repurchases and million in dividend payments during as a result  the company increased cash and cash equivalents million during the year ended december  the company ended the year with cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million and a debt free balance sheet 
the decline in the demand for freight services and an overcapacity of trucks has negatively impacted the operating results of the soft freight demand has resulted in downward pressures on freight and fuel surcharge rates and has resulted in higher empty miles and lower equipment utilization 
fuel expense during was the result of two distinct periods of pricing 
from january to july  the company experienced rising fuel prices that reached a peak during early july from early july to december  the company experienced declining fuel prices 
us average doe prices were approximately per gallon the first part of january  which rose to approximately in early july and fell to approximately by the end of due to the rise and fall of fuel prices during the year  fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge recoveries  decreased to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  annualizing fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge recoveries  at the peak of fuel during  would have resulted in an increase of approximately in our net fuel expense for therefore increases and decreases in fuel prices  as we experienced during will continue to have the potential for materially affecting our financial results 
the company hires only experienced drivers with safe driving records 
in order to attract and retain experienced drivers who understand the importance of customer service  the company has sought to solidify its position as an industry leader in driver compensation by increasing driver compensation three out of the last five years

results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of expense items to total operating revenue for the years indicated 
year ended december  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and benefits rent and purchased transportation fuel operations and maintenance operating taxes and license insurance and claims communications and utilities depreciation other operating expenses gain on disposal of property and equipment operating income interest income income before income taxes income taxes net income year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating revenue increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the period 
the increase in revenue was the net effect of a million increase in fuel surcharge revenue from million in to million in offset by a decrease in freight revenues of million from million in to million in freight revenues declined million on the net result of fewer miles driven million and a slight increase in rates due to general changes in customer mix million 
miles driven year over year was directly related to soft freight demand experienced during compared to the increase in fuel surcharge revenues was the direct result of higher average fuel prices throughout compared to fuel surcharge revenues represent fuel costs passed on to customers based on customer specific fuel charge recovery rates and billed loaded miles 
salaries  wages  and benefits increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the period 
the increase was the net result of a million decrease in driver wages  a million increase in office and shop wages  a million increase in workers compensation and a million increase increase in health insurance  and a decrease of other benefits and payroll taxes of million 
during the year ended december   employee drivers accounted for and independent contractors for of the total fleet miles  compared with and  respectively  for company driver wages decrease was consistent with the decrease in freight revenues detailed above due to freight volume declines in compared to with no mileage rate changes during office and shop personnel increased as a result of a higher number of employees in certain strategic areas as well as annual wage increases 
workers compensation expense increased million due to an overall increase in frequency and severity of claims incurred 
health insurance expense increased million due mainly to an increase in average monthly claims 
rent and purchased transportation decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the compared period of of the total decrease  million related to a decrease in miles driven by independent contractors  offset by an increase of million in fuel stabilization payments due to higher average fuel costs during compared to the remaining million decrease was due to other rents which included rents on office space prior to the company moving into a company owned terminal location in phoenix and corporate headquarters in north liberty during may and july  respectively 
fuel increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period of the increase is the net result of an average increase in fuel cost per gallon of per gallon from an average of per gallon in to an average of per gallon in offset by an approximate decrease in total gallons purchased 
the decrease in gallons purchased during compared to was the result of fewer company driver miles due to weaker freight demand and an increase in fuel economy 
the company s average miles per gallon increased compared to and out of route miles decreased which the company attributes to the efforts to manage idle time and out of route costs during the year 
operations and maintenance increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the compared period due to an increase in preventative maintenance and parts replacement related to an increase in the average age of the tractor fleet  costs associated with trade truck campaign and higher than usual operations and maintenance costs during the early months of based on more adverse weather conditions 
insurance and claims increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period of due to an increase in the frequency and severity of larger claims during compared to depreciation decreased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the compared period 
tractors accounted for million of the total decrease 
the tractor decrease is attributable to an overall decrease in average depreciation per tractor compared to mainly as a result of the average age of the tractor fleet 
this decrease was due to timing of new tractor purchases 
new tractors with higher depreciable bases were not purchased and placed in service until the third and fourth quarters of  as such older tractor equipment was depreciated for the majority of as tractors are depreciated using the declining balance method  depreciation expense declines in years subsequent to the first year after initial purchase and continue to decline with the age of the fleet 
the decrease in tractor depreciation was offset by higher depreciation on buildings  furniture and fixtures  and land improvements due to a full year of depreciation on our new corporate headquarters facilities opened in july and new phoenix terminal opened in june 
other operating expenses were essentially unchanged during the year ended december  compared to the same period of other operating expenses consists of costs incurred for advertising expense  freight handling  highway tolls  driver recruiting expenses  and administrative costs 
gain on the disposal of property and equipment decreased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the same period of during the company started a tractor fleet upgrade campaign and as of december   the company was approximately through this campaign 
as such  approximately million of the gains related to gains on traded tractors 
during the company sold real estate in columbus  ohio  coralville  iowa  and dubois  pennsylvania recording total gains of approximately million with the remaining gains attributable to revenue equipment sales and trades 
the proceeds received from these sales were used in the financing of the new corporate headquarters 
a tractor fleet upgrade was completed in december and therefore tractor trades in were less than compared to the company does not expect gains on a per tractor basis to be as high during future years as it has been for the past several years as the company will have substantially disposed of all tractors with a lower initial recorded basis due to purchases of tractors prior to adoption of sfas interest income decreased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the same period of as the net result of a decrease in average cash  cash equivalents  and investments year over year due primarily to the payment of the special dividend in may million 
offsetting the decrease in average interest bearing balances was an improved average rate of return on cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
the majority of interest income continues to be associated with the company s investment in student loan auction rate securities 
the current rates of return on these investments continues to exceed the rates of return on similar aaa rated  non taxable securities 
the company s effective tax rate was and  respectively  for the years ended december  and this decrease is primarily attributable to a net reduction of tax accruals for uncertain tax positions as required under fasb interpretation no 
fin 
during the company s fin tax adjustment was a net reduction to tax expense of million 
this decrease relates to the reduction of the accrual for uncertain tax positions and associated accrued penalties and interest due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was during the year ended december  compared with during the year ended december  net income decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million during the compared period as a result of the net effects discussed above 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating revenue increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the period 
the increase in revenue resulted from the company s expansion of its fleet  increased freight miles  and improved freight rates 
operating revenue for both periods was positively impacted by fuel surcharges assessed to customers 
fuel surcharge revenue increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the compared period 
salaries  wages  and benefits increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the period 
these increases were the result of increased reliance on employee drivers due to a decrease in the number of independent contractors utilized by the company and driver pay increases 
the company increased driver pay by per mile in january for all drivers maintaining a valid hazardous materials endorsement on their commercial driver s license and implemented quarterly pay increases in for selected operating divisions 
the cumulative impact of the quarterly increases to driver compensation in resulted in a cost increase of approximately million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   employee drivers accounted for and independent contractors for of the total fleet miles  compared with and  respectively  for additional miles in by company drivers accounted for approximately million increase in wages over workers compensation expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million in for the same period in due to an increase in frequency and severity of claims 
health insurance expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period of due to a decrease in frequency and severity of claims 
the remaining increase was the result of non driver payroll increases 
rent and purchased transportation decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the compared period of this reflects the company s decreased reliance upon independent contractors 
rent and purchased transportation for both periods includes amounts paid to independent contractors under the company s fuel stability program 
in the first quarter of  the company increased the independent contractor base mileage pay by per mile for all independent contractors maintaining a hazardous materials endorsement on their commercial driver s license  and an additional per mile per quarter in beginning on april  these base mileage pay increases of approximately million in were offset by a decrease attributable to fewer miles driven by independent contractors 
fuel increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period of the increase is the result of an increase in fuel cost per gallon  an increased reliance on company owned tractors  and a decrease in fuel economy associated with certain epa mandated clean air engine requirements on tractor models acquired during the company s fuel cost per company owned tractor mile increased during compared to fuel cost per mile  net of fuel surcharge  increased in compared to the company s fuel cost per gallon increased in and average miles per gallon decreased compared to operations and maintenance decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the compared period due to an increase in preventative maintenance and parts replacement 
operating taxes and licenses increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the compared period due an increase in the property taxes associated with new facilities in phoenix  arizona and north liberty  iowa and an increase in fuel taxes paid 
insurance and claims increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period of due to an increase in the frequency of larger claims and development increases on existing liability claims 
depreciation increased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the compared period 
this increase is attributable to the growth of our company owned tractor and trailer fleet  and an increased cost of new tractors and trailers relative to the costs of those units being replaced 
our tractor and trailer fleet have grown approximately and respectively in comparison to the same period in this contributed to a million increase in revenue equipment depreciation during also  higher depreciation on new corporate headquarters facilities and new phoenix terminal contributed to an increase of million in other property and equipment depreciation 
other operating expenses were essentially unchanged during the year ended december  compared to the same period of other operating expenses consists of costs incurred for advertising expense  freight handling  highway tolls  driver recruiting expenses  and administrative costs 
gain on the disposal of property and equipment decreased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the same period of the decline is attributable to an decrease in the total number of tractors and trailers traded during the period compared to the same period of a tractor fleet upgrade was completed in december during the company sold real estate in columbus  ohio  coralville  iowa  and dubois  pennsylvania recording total gains of approximately million 
the proceeds received from these sales were used in the financing of the new corporate headquarters 
interest income decreased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the same period of because of the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and investments associated with the payment of the special dividend in may offset by improved rate of return on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
the company s effective tax rate was and  respectively  for the years ended december  and the increase is primarily attributable to a higher effective state rate as a result of the adoption of fasb interpretation no 
fin effective january  as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was during the year ended december  compared with during the year ended december  net income decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million during the compared period as a result of the net effects discussed above 
inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology  epa mandated new engine emission requirements on tractor engines manufactured after january   and driver comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  as well as there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
during the company experienced a increase in tractor prices associated with tractors with latest engine emission requirements compared to tractor prices associated with the last fleet upgrade with pre january tractor engines 
the majority of this increase was not limited by increases in freight rates during in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and operating taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
fuel prices  compared to historical averages  were high throughout   and  and reached historical highs during  thus increasing our cost of operations 
in addition to the increased fuel costs  the reduced fuel efficiency of the new epa engines has put additional pressure on profitability due to increased fuel consumption 
competitive conditions in the transportation industry during and  such as lower demand for transportation services  has and will continue to affect the company s ability to obtain rate increases or fuel surcharges until there is improvement in the demand for transportation services 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment 
historically the company has been debt free  funding revenue equipment purchases with cash flow provided by operations which was the case during with the new tractors and new trailers that were acquired 
the company also obtains tractor capacity by utilizing independent contractors  who provide a tractor and bear all associated operating and financing expenses 
the company s primary source of liquidity for the year ended december   was net cash provided by operating activities of million compared to million in due primarily to net income excluding non cash depreciation  deferred tax and amortization of unearned compensation  and gains on disposal of equipment being approximately million lower in compared to offset with an increase in operating cash flow generated by operating assets and liabilities of approximately million 
the net increase in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of reductions in accounts receivable balances due to collections  increases in accident and workers compensation insurance accruals  offset by reductions in accrued income taxes mainly due to uncertain tax position accrual changes 
cash flow from operating activities was of operating revenues in compared with in capital expenditures for property and equipment  net of trade ins  totaled million for compared to million during the majority of the capital expenditures related to the purchase of new tractors and trailers 
the company currently expects capital expenditures for property and equipment  net of trades in  to be approximately million 
the expected increase in cash outflows for property and equipment  net of trade ins in  is mainly due to remainder of the company s purchase commitment for our current tractor fleet upgrade campaign 
also included in total expenditures in was approximately million associated with the acquisition of the company s terminal location near dallas  texas 
total expenditures for the new corporate headquarters  including furniture and fixtures  and shop facility in north liberty  iowa and our phoenix facility were approximately million during the company paid cash dividends of million in compared to million in the company paid a one time special dividend of million during the second quarter of all dividends declared during were paid during the company paid income taxes of million in which was a decrease of million compared to million paid in the decrease was mainly due to a decrease in federal tax payments during the year as a result of a reduction in taxable income in compared to due mainly to lower income before taxes and the bonus depreciation allowed on new tractor and trailer purchases during in september  the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million shares  adjusted for stock splits  of heartland express  inc common stock in open market or negotiated transactions using available cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
during the years ended december  and  approximately million and million shares were repurchased  respectively  in the open market and pursuant to the above referenced plan and a quarterly trade plan under rule b  for million and million  respectively  at an approximate weighted average price of and per share  respectively  and the shares were retired 
the cost of such shares purchased and retired in excess of their par value in the amount of approximately of million and million during the years ended december  and was charged to retained earnings 
the authorization to repurchase remains open at december  and has no expiration date but may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
approximately million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the board of director s approval at december  during january and february  the company repurchased an additional million shares  at million for an average price of per share 
this has subsequently reduced the remaining authorized shares for repurchase to million shares as of february  future repurchases are dependent upon market conditions 
management believes the company has adequate liquidity to meet its current and projected needs 
management believes the company will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term which are expected to be funded from cash flow provided by operations and from existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
the company ended the year with million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
the company s balance sheet remains debt free 
net working capital for the year ended december  decreased by million over the most significant factor causing the decrease was the reclassification of short term investments in auction rate securities of approximately million to long term investments 
excluding the reclassification of investments  working capital increased million in compared to subsequent to auction failures of auction rate student loan securities that began in mid february  the company has been redirecting its investments towards its cash and cash equivalents 
based on the company s strong financial position  management believes outside financing could be obtained  if necessary  to fund capital expenditures 
as of december   all of the company s million long term investment balance was invested in auction rate student loan educational bonds 
the majority  approximately at par of the underlying investments is backed by the us government and continues to hold aaa or equivalent ratings from recognized rating agencies 
the remaining of the student loan auction rate securities portfolio hold aa ratings and were insurance backed securities 
beginning in mid february  the auction rate securities began experiencing auction failures due to general liquidity concerns 
prior to the company experiencing unsuccessful auctions  the auction rate security investments were classified as short term as they were auctioned and sold or interest rates were reset through a regular auction process generally occurring at least every days from the initial purchase 
due to the current lack of liquidity in these markets  the company s current options are to hold the investments until called by the issuer or until maturity and continue to earn average rates of return that currently exceed the average rates of return on other aaa rated  short term  tax free instruments or sell its investments at a discount 
management continues to believe that current amounts of cash and cash equivalents along with cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet the company s short term cash flow requirements and therefore has chosen to hold such investments until successful auctions resume or the investments are called by the issuer rather than selling the securities at discounted prices 
should the need arise  the company believes it would be able to secure financing  without selling investments at a discount  based on the company s current debt free balance sheet  strong operating results and the fact that certain financial institutions are offering loans secured by the auction rate securities relating to the settlement agreements between certain regulatory agencies  and various financial institutions  as discussed below 
the company was required to estimate the fair value of the auction rate securities applying guidance in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas which became effective for the company as of january  fair value represents an estimate of what the company could have sold the investments for in an orderly transaction with a third party as of the december  measurement date although it is not the intent of the company to sell such securities at discounted pricing 
historically  the fair value of such investments was reported based on amortized cost 
until auction failures began  the fair value of these investments were calculated using level observable inputs per sfas and fair value was deemed to be equivalent to amortized cost due to the short term and regularly occurring auction process 
based on auction failures beginning in mid february and continued failures through december   there were not any observable quoted prices or other relevant inputs for identical or similar securities 
estimated fair value of all auction rate security investments as of december  was calculated using unobservable  level inputs  as defined by sfas due to the lack of observable market inputs specifically related to student loan auction rate securities 
as such  the reported fair value could significantly change in future measurement periods 
the estimated fair value of the underlying investments as of december  declined below amortized cost of the investments  as a result of liquidity issues in the auction rate markets 
with the assistance of the company s financial advisors  fair values of the student loan auction rate securities were estimated using a discounted cash flow approach to value the underlying collateral of the trust issuing the debt securities considering the estimated average life of the underlying student loans that are the collateral to the trusts  principal outstanding  expected rates of returns  and payout formulas 
these underlying cash flows were discounted using interest rates consistent with instruments of similar quality and duration with an adjustment for a higher required yield for lack of liquidity in the market for these auction rate securities 
the company obtained an understanding of assumptions in models used by third party financial institutions to estimate fair value and considered these assumptions in the company s cash flow models but did not exclusively use the fair values provided by financial institutions based on their internal modeling 
the company is aware that trading of student loan auction rate securities is occurring in secondary markets which were considered in the company s fair value assessment although the company has not listed any of its assets for sale on the secondary market 
as a result of the fair value measurements  the company recognized an unrealized loss and reduction to investments  of million during the twelve month period ended december  there was not any unrealized loss on investments as of december  as the auctions had functioned regularly through that date 
the unrealized loss of million  net of tax  was recorded as an adjustment to other accumulated comprehensive loss 
the fair value adjustment did not have any impact on the company s consolidated statement of income for the twelve months ended december  during the third and fourth quarters of various financial institutions and respective regulatory authorities announced proposed settlement terms in response to various regulatory authorities alleging certain financial institutions misled investors regarding the liquidity risks associated with auction rate securities that the respective financial institutions underwrote  marketed and sold 
further the respective regulatory authorities alleged the respective financial institutions misrepresented to customers that auction rate securities were safe  highly liquid investments that were comparable to money markets 
certain settlement agreements were finalized prior to december  in general  the majority of our auction rate security investments were not covered by the terms of the above mentioned settlement agreements 
the focus of the initial settlements was generally towards individuals  charities and businesses with small investment balances  holdings of million and less 
as part of the general terms of the settlements  the respective financial institutions have agreed to provide their best efforts in providing liquidity to the auction rate securities market for investors not specifically covered by the terms of the respective settlements 
such liquidity solutions could be in the form of facilitating issuer redemptions  resecuritizations  or other means 
the company can not currently project when liquidity will be obtained from these investments  and currently plans to hold such securities until the securities are called  redeemed  or resecuritized by the debt issuers 
a portion of these holdings at par value were specifically covered by a settlement agreement which the company signed during the fourth quarter of by signing the settlement agreement the company relinquished its rights to bring any claims against the financial institution as well as its right to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any class action 
further  the company no longer has the sole discretion and right to sell or otherwise dispose of  and or enter orders in the auction process with respect to the underlying securities 
as part of the settlement  the company obtained a put option to sell the underlying securities to the financial institution  which is exercisable during the period starting on june  through july  plus accrued interest 
should the financial institution sell or otherwise dispose of our securities the company will receive the par value of the securities plus accrued interest one business day after the transaction 
upon signing the settlement agreement the company no longer exhibits the intent and ability to hold the underlying securities for recovery of the temporary decline in fair value 
the company also acquired an asset  a put option that is to be valued as a stand alone financial instrument separate from the underlying securities 
the amount deemed as a loss due to temporary impairment of securities was not materially different from the amount of the gain recorded to recognize the fair value of the put option acquired as part of the settlement 
as such  there was not any impact to the company s consolidated statement of income for the signing of this settlement agreement 
the estimated fair value of the put option combined with the estimated fair value of the underlying securities  as of december  is set at par value of the securities 
the par value of these securities is included in long term investments per the consolidated balance sheet 
the company has evaluated the unrealized losses  on securities other than securities covered by the settlement agreement discussed above  to determine whether this decline is other than temporary 
management has concluded the decline in fair value to be temporary based on the following considerations 
o current market activity and the lack of severity or extended decline do not warrant such action at this time 
o during june  the company received million as the result of a partial call by an issuer 
the company received par value for the amount of the call plus accrued interest 
o during third quarter of  the company received million in calls by the underlying issuers 
the company received par value for the amount of the call plus accrued interest 
o during the fourth quarter of  the company received million in calls by the underlying issuers 
the company received par value for the amount of the call plus accrued interest 
o based on the company s financial operating results  operating cash flows and debt free balance sheet  the company has the ability and intent to hold such securities until recovery of the unrealized loss 
o there have not been any significant changes in collateralization and ratings of the underlying securities since the first failed auction 
the company continues to hold of the auction rate security portfolio in senior positions of aaa or equivalent rated securities 
o the company is not aware of any changes in default rates of the underlying student loans that are the assets to the trusts issuing the auction rate security debt 
o currently there is legislative pressure to provide liquidity in student loan investments  providing liquidity to state student loan agencies  to continue to provide financial assistance to eligible students to enable higher educations 
this has the potential to impact existing securities with underlying student loans 
o as individual trusts that are the issuers of the auction rate student loan debt  which the company holds  continue to pay higher default rates of interest  there is the potential that the underlying trust would seek alternative financing and call the existing debt at which point it is estimated the company would receive par value of the investment 
o all of the auction rate securities are held with financial institutions that have agreed in principle to settlement agreements with various regulatory agencies to provide liquidity 
although the principles of the respective settlement agreements focus mostly on small investors generally companies and individual investors with auction rate security assets less than million  the respective settlements state the financial institutions will work with issuers and other interested parties to use their best efforts to provide liquidity solutions to companies not specifically covered by the principle terms of the respective settlements by as early as the end of in certain settlement agreements 
in addition to the items noted above  the company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until recovery  therefore there was not any other than temporary impairment recorded on these investments  other than the investments specifically covered by the settlement agreement discussed above  during the year ended december  the effects of the settlement agreement noted above did not result in any net impairment charge being recorded in the consolidated statement of income during the year ended december  management will monitor its investments and ongoing market conditions in future periods to assess impairments considered to be other than temporary 
should estimated fair value continue to remain below cost or the fair value decrease significantly from current fair value  the company may be required to record an impairment of these investments  through a charge in the consolidated statement of income 
off balance sheet transactions the company s liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period in millions less than contractual obligations total year years years other purchase obligation operating lease obligations fin obligations  including interest and penalties the purchase obligations reflect the total purchase price  net of trade values of traded tractors  for tractors scheduled to be delivered during these purchases are expected to be financed by existing cash and cash flows from operations 
fin obligations represent potential liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
the amount includes interest and penalties 
the company is unable to reasonably determine when these amounts will be settled 
as of december  the company did not have any significant operating lease obligations  capital lease obligations or outstanding long term debt obligations 
the company recognized additional tax liabilities of million with a corresponding reduction to beginning retained earnings as of january  as a result of the adoption of fin the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was million as of january   the date of adoption and million at december  at december   the company had a total of million in gross unrecognized tax benefits 
of this amount  million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate 
unrecognized tax benefits were a net decrease of approximately million during the year ended december   due mainly to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation net of additions 
the total net amount of accrued interest and penalties for such unrecognized tax benefits was million at december  and million at december  and is included in income taxes payable 
net interest and penalties included in income tax expense for the three and twelve month periods ended december  was an additional tax expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
net interest and penalties included in income tax expense for the three and twelve month periods ended december  was an additional tax expense of million and million  respectively 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate to risks associated with state income tax filing positions for the company s corporate subsidiaries 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately settled 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for uncertain tax positions 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
the company has identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect the financial statements include the following revenue is recognized when freight is delivered 
selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers are and years  respectively 
estimates of salvage value are based upon the expected market values of equipment at the end of the expected useful life 
management estimates accruals for the self insured portion of pending accident liability  workers compensation  physical damage and cargo damage claims 
these accruals are based upon individual case estimates  including reserve development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is required to be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been established other than million allowance for a deferred tax asset associated with the auction rate securities fair value adjustment  due to the profitability of the company s business

investments are valued at fair value applying a fair value hierarchy as established by applicable gaap 
fair value estimates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
as there is not an active market for these securities  management utilizes a discounted cash flow model with key assumptions being the discount rate  rate of return and duration 
management does not consider there to be significant credit risk due to government support of the underlying loans and current credit ratings 
management monitors its investments and ongoing market conditions to assess impairments considered to be other than temporary 
should estimated fair values continue to remain below cost or the fair value decreases significantly from current fair value  the company may be required to record an impairment of these investments  through a charge in the consolidated statement of income 
the company has not recorded any impairment of these investments in the consolidated statement of income 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period
